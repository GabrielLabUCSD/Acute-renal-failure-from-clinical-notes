He has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, indicating obesity. The patient has been advised to lose weight prior to surgery to reduce the risk of complications.

His past medical history also includes type 2 diabetes, which is managed with a combination of metformin and lifestyle modifications. His blood glucose levels are within the target range. The patient has been educated on the importance of blood glucose control during the perioperative period to minimize the risk of surgical site infections and delayed wound healing.

The patient had a cholecystectomy 10 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. There were no complications during the surgery, and the patient recovered uneventfully. His gallbladder pathology report confirmed the presence of multiple cholesterol gallstones.

He also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, for which he uses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy during sleep. The patient has been instructed to bring his CPAP machine to the hospital for use during the postoperative period to mitigate the risk of respiratory complications.

Other significant medical history includes gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for which the patient takes proton-pump inhibitors as needed. He reports occasional heartburn but denies any dysphagia or unintended weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed 3 years ago revealed mild esophagitis.

His family history is notable for coronary artery disease in his father, who suffered a myocardial infarction at age 55. The patient has never experienced any cardiac symptoms himself and has not undergone any cardiac evaluation.

The patient denies any tobacco or alcohol use. He exercises sporadically and admits to a sedentary lifestyle due to his work demands.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. He had adequate pain control and was able to ambulate independently within 24 hours of surgery. The surgical wound healed well without any signs of infection. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three.

There were no complications observed postoperatively. He did not experience any adverse reactions to anesthesia or medications. The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout the hospital stay. He was scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks for wound evaluation and further management of his chronic conditions.
