His surgical procedure is planned for a hernia repair. He had a previous hernia repair 15 years ago without any complications. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient has reported occasional joint pain, particularly in his knees and hips. He has not had any formal evaluation for these symptoms but manages them with over-the-counter pain relievers as needed.
