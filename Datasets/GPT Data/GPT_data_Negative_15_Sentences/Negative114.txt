Patient X is a 60-year-old male who has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. He is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. Preoperatively, the patient underwent an evaluation by the anesthesiologist, which revealed controlled blood pressure on antihypertensive medication, well-managed blood glucose levels with oral hypoglycemic agents, and a stable lipid profile on statin therapy.

His preoperative laboratory investigations showed no abnormalities in renal function, liver enzymes, or coagulation parameters. His hemoglobin level was within the normal range, and there were no signs of active infection. The patient had a chest X-ray performed, which showed no signs of acute pulmonary disease. An EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities.

Patient X underwent the surgery under general anesthesia without complications. In the immediate postoperative period, he was monitored closely in the recovery room. His vital signs remained stable, with no signs of hypotension or tachycardia. Postoperative pain control was achieved using patient-controlled analgesia, and he reported satisfactory pain relief.

He received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and was encouraged to perform leg exercises and ambulation under the supervision of physical therapy. Patient X was able to tolerate a regular diet and his urine output and bowel movements were within normal limits. His blood glucose levels were well-controlled throughout the postoperative period.

Patient X did not demonstrate any signs or symptoms of infection, such as fever, redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical site. He responded well to antibiotic prophylaxis and showed no signs of wound complications. Postoperative radiographs revealed proper alignment of the knee prosthesis, and the surgical wound was healing satisfactorily.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was transferred to the general medical/surgical ward on the second day after surgery. During his hospital stay, he received physical therapy to aid in his ambulation and rehabilitation. As he demonstrated good progress, he was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy and continued medication management.

Complications such as acute renal failure or other major surgical site complications were not observed in Patient X. However, regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid profile, along with assessing for signs of infection or any delayed wound healing. Patient education regarding postoperative self-care, including incision care, medication compliance, and lifestyle modifications, was provided to ensure optimal recovery.
