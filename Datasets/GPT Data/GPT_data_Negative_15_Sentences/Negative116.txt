The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managing his conditions with oral medications for the past few years. The patient also has a family history of cardiovascular disease.

Recently, the patient has been experiencing symptoms of deteriorating joint function due to osteoarthritis in his knees. Conservative treatments such as physical therapy and analgesics have not provided significant relief, so the patient has decided to undergo knee replacement surgery to improve his quality of life.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough medical evaluation, which included a cardiac stress test that revealed stable coronary artery disease and good exercise tolerance. There were no signs of active infection or other systemic diseases that would increase perioperative risk.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the day before surgery and received standard preoperative care, including fasting and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. His blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid levels were within target ranges. The patient was counseled on deep vein thrombosis prevention, and appropriate prophylactic measures were implemented.

The knee replacement surgery was performed successfully, and the patient was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit. He received adequate pain control and was started on physical therapy the day after surgery to promote mobility and early ambulation.

During the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored for any complications. His vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of infection at the surgical site. The patient was encouraged to perform regular breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to prevent respiratory complications.

Despite careful postoperative management, the patient experienced a delayed wound healing complication at the surgical site, which required additional wound care and antibiotic therapy. However, with appropriate treatment and wound care, the complication resolved within a few weeks.

The patientâ€™s blood glucose levels were monitored closely due to his underlying diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy was initiated during the hospital stay to maintain tight glycemic control and prevent hyperglycemia-related complications.

The patient's postoperative pain was well controlled with a combination of oral opioids and non-opioid analgesics. Physical therapy was continued during the hospital stay and further extended as part of the patient's post-discharge rehabilitation plan.

Before discharge, the patient underwent a thorough medication review, and his regular antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications were resumed at appropriate doses.

The patient has been advised to follow up with both his orthopedic surgeon and primary care physician for regular postoperative assessments, wound checks, and further management of his chronic conditions and ongoing recovery.

In conclusion, the patient underwent successful knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis. He experienced a delayed wound healing complication, which resolved with appropriate care. The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful, and he is currently in the rehabilitation phase of his recovery.
