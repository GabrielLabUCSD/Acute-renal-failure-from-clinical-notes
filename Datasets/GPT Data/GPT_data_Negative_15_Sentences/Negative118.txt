The patient is a 60-year-old female who is scheduled to undergo surgery. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. She takes medications for these conditions, including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin.

In addition to her chronic conditions, the patient also has a history of osteoarthritis in her knees, for which she takes over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed. She does not have any known drug allergies.

The patient had a preoperative evaluation that included a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and an electrocardiogram (ECG). All of these tests were within normal limits. Her preoperative chest x-ray did not reveal any significant abnormalities.

During the surgery, the patient tolerated anesthesia well and there were no complications. She received general anesthesia and an indwelling urinary catheter was placed during the procedure. She had a smooth intraoperative course with stable vital signs.

In the postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and closely monitored. Her pain was managed with a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics. She was able to tolerate oral intake and was well-hydrated.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout her postoperative course. She was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications. The indwelling urinary catheter was removed on postoperative day one without any issues.

The patient's surgical site was inspected daily for signs of infection or delayed wound healing. No signs of infection or wound complications were observed. The patient's pain improved progressively, and she was transitioned to oral pain medications as needed.

The patient's postoperative laboratory tests, including CBC and CMP, were within normal limits. Her blood glucose levels were carefully monitored given her diabetes diagnosis, and appropriate adjustments were made to her oral medication regimen to maintain glycemic control.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and did not experience any complications related to the surgery. She was discharged on postoperative day three and instructed to follow up with her primary care physician in two weeks. She was advised to continue her regular medications and to monitor her surgical incision for any signs of infection.
