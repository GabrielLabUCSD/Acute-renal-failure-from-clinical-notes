The patient is a 68-year-old male who has a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He has a surgical history of a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure five years ago. Currently, he is on a daily antihypertensive medication regimen consisting of lisinopril and metoprolol, as well as metformin for diabetes control and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

For the past few months, the patient has been experiencing worsening symptoms of angina and shortness of breath on exertion. Due to the progression of his coronary artery disease, it has been recommended that the patient undergo a surgical procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat his coronary stenosis. This involves the use of a stent to open up the narrowed artery and improve blood flow to the heart. The patient has consented to the procedure and is scheduled to undergo PCI in two weeks.

The patient's preoperative assessment includes a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. His laboratory results show a well-controlled blood glucose level, normal renal function, and within target lipid levels. His echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction with no significant valvular abnormalities. Overall, his preoperative evaluation indicates he is a suitable candidate for PCI.

After the surgery, the patient's postoperative course is uneventful. He is monitored in the coronary care unit for 24 hours and then transferred to a regular cardiac floor. His vital signs remain stable, and he is pain-free with well-controlled angina. The patient is started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent stent thrombosis, and his other medications are continued as before.

During his hospitalization, the patient is regularly assessed for signs of surgical site infection, thromboembolism, bleeding complications, and cardiac function. His incision site remains clean and intact, and no signs of infection are noted. He receives prophylactic measures to prevent deep vein thrombosis, such as early ambulation and compression stockings. The patient's bleeding parameters remain within normal limits, and his hemoglobin levels are stable.

The patient is monitored for cardiac function through serial electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes. There are no signs of myocardial infarction or ischemia, and his troponin levels remain within the normal range. The patient is able to tolerate a progressive increase in activity and is encouraged to participate in cardiac rehabilitation.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's blood glucose levels are closely monitored and well-controlled with his regular diabetes medications. He receives dietary education and guidance to maintain healthy glycemic control. As his postoperative course progresses, the patient shows steady improvement and is discharged home on the fourth postoperative day.

In summary, this 68-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of his coronary stenosis. His postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications noted. The patient's vital signs remained stable, he had well-controlled angina, and his surgical site remained clean. The patient showed no signs of myocardial infarction or ischemia, and his cardiac enzymes were normal. His blood glucose levels were well-controlled throughout his hospitalization. Overall, his recovery was smooth, and he was discharged home on the fourth postoperative day to continue his regular medications and participate in cardiac rehabilitation.
