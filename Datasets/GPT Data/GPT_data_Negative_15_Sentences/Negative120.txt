The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are well controlled with medication. He is planning to have surgery due to a chronic issue with his gallbladder. The patient has a history of multiple gallstone attacks, and recent imaging studies have confirmed the presence of gallstones. As a result, the decision has been made to proceed with cholecystectomy surgery.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient has not undergone any major procedures in the past. He did, however, have a minor knee surgery approximately five years ago to repair a torn meniscus. The procedure went well, and there were no reported complications during the postoperative period.

On further assessment, the patient reports no known drug allergies and is not currently taking any medications other than those prescribed for his hypertension and diabetes. Laboratory tests have been conducted, including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and coagulation profile, which have all come back within normal limits.

The patient has been informed about the surgery and its associated risks, including but not limited to infection, bleeding, and damage to surrounding structures. An informed consent has been obtained, and he has been advised to refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight the night before the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to receive appropriate pain management, including analgesics as needed. He will also be monitored closely for signs of infection, such as fever, redness, or increased pain at the surgical site. The patient will be encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications like deep vein thrombosis and atelectasis.

If any complications were to arise postoperatively, they would be promptly managed by the surgical team. This may include interventions such as antibiotics for infection, blood transfusions for significant bleeding, or re-interventions for any complications directly related to the surgery itself.

The patient's family has been informed of the planned surgery and are supportive. They have been educated on providing postoperative care, encouraging the patient to rest and assisting with activities of daily living as needed during the recovery period.

Overall, the patient is considered to be a suitable candidate for surgery and has been adequately prepared for the procedure. The surgical team will closely monitor his postoperative course and promptly address any complications that may arise to ensure an optimal recovery.
