The patient is a middle-aged male who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managed with oral medications for his chronic conditions, with good control of his blood pressure and blood glucose levels. There is no history of any major surgeries or allergies. The patient reports no smoking history but admits to occasional alcohol use.

In preparation for the upcoming surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits, including complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function tests, and coagulation profile. His hemoglobin A1c level was 6.2%, indicating well-managed diabetes.

The patient was consulted with an anesthesiologist and deemed suitable for general anesthesia. A peripheral intravenous line was initiated, and appropriate fasting instructions were provided. The surgical team discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure, along with possible complications such as infection, bleeding, and allergic reactions to anesthesia. The patient signed the informed consent form and was provided with instructions for postoperative care.

Following the surgery, the patient recovered well in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Vital signs remained stable, and there were no immediate complications noted. He was able to ambulate with minimal assistance and reported tolerable pain, managed with oral analgesics. Intravenous fluids were administered to maintain hydration, and he was closely monitored for any signs of infection, bleeding, or delayed wound healing.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on the second postoperative day. He was instructed to continue his regular medications, including his antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications. The surgical wound was clean, dry, and intact, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. Home care instructions were provided, including proper wound care techniques, gradual increase in physical activity, and signs to watch for in case of complications.

At the one-week postoperative follow-up, the patient reported minimal pain and no issues with wound healing. His vital signs were stable, and laboratory investigations showed normal renal function. The surgical site appeared to be healing well, with no signs of infection or other complications. The patient was advised to gradually resume his regular activities and scheduled for a routine follow-up appointment in one month.

In summary, this middle-aged male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia. His preoperative evaluation was within normal limits, and he had an uneventful postoperative course. No complications were noted, and the patient was discharged home with appropriate instructions and follow-up plans.
