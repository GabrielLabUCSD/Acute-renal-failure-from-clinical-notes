The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a previous myocardial infarction. The patient also has a history of tobacco use, although he quit smoking five years ago. His current medications include lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and aspirin for cardiovascular protection.

The patient has a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having undergone a coronary artery bypass graft surgery at the age of 60. The patient's preoperative workup revealed stable cardiac function, with an ejection fraction of 55% on echocardiogram. His renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient has been advised to continue his medications until the day of surgery, with the exception of metformin, which will be held on the day of surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis.

During the postoperative course, the patient recovers well initially, with stable vital signs and minimal pain. He is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent postoperative complications. The patient is started on prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infection. He is also closely monitored for signs of deep vein thrombosis and receives appropriate prophylaxis, which includes subcutaneous heparin injections.

The patient's recovery progresses without any major complications. His surgical incision heals well, with no signs of infection. The patient's pain is adequately controlled with medications, and he is able to tolerate a regular diet. His blood glucose levels are monitored closely, and insulin is initiated as needed for glycemic control. The patient is also encouraged to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking cessation and regular exercise, to optimize his long-term health outcomes.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course is unremarkable, and he is discharged home on postoperative day four. He is advised to continue his regular medications, including aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. The patient is instructed to follow up with his primary care physician and cardiologist for routine postoperative care. The surgical team provides the patient with appropriate discharge instructions and ensures that he understands the signs and symptoms of potential complications, such as infection or bleeding, and when to seek medical attention.

In summary, this 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction is planning to undergo surgery. He has a stable cardiac function and normal renal function. The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, without any major complications. He is discharged home with instructions for follow-up care and is encouraged to continue his medications and engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors.
