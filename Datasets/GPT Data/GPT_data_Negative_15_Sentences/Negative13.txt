The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, for which he takes regular medications. He has a family history of heart disease, and he is a current smoker, with a 20-pack year history. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is managed with oral medications. He has no known allergies to medications.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy in childhood but otherwise has not undergone any other surgeries. He reports no significant past complications or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient's preoperative lab results show well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels within normal limits. His renal function is also normal, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 95 mL/min.

During the surgery, the patient was administered general anesthesia without any immediate complications. The surgical procedure went as planned, with no intraoperative complications reported. The patient was closely monitored throughout the procedure to ensure his vital signs remained stable.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was brought to the recovery room, where his vital signs and pain level were closely monitored. He received intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. His vital signs remained stable, and his pain was well-controlled. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulate without assistance within a few hours after surgery. The patient did not experience any surgical site infections or wound complications.

To prevent the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the patient was started on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy following the surgery. Sequential compression devices were also used to promote blood flow and prevent DVT formation.

The patient's postoperative laboratory evaluation, including a complete blood count and metabolic panel, showed no abnormalities. His blood glucose levels were well-controlled during the postoperative period.

The patient was discharged from the hospital three days after the surgery. He was provided with appropriate postoperative instructions, including wound care, medications, and follow-up appointments. The patient was advised to quit smoking to reduce his risk of complications and to improve overall health.

In conclusion, the patient's preoperative period was characterized by well-controlled blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and normal renal function. The surgical procedure was uneventful, and the patient's postoperative course was free from complications including acute renal failure. However, the patient's history of smoking and family history of heart disease indicate the need for long-term lifestyle modifications to reduce his cardiovascular risk.
