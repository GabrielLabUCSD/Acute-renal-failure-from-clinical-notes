The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently on antihypertensive medication and oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating that he is overweight. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery due to severe coronary artery disease. He has a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the past, resulting in decreased cardiac function. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35%, indicating reduced pumping capacity of the heart.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant stenosis in multiple coronary arteries. His preoperative cardiac workup, including stress test and Holter monitoring, did not show any significant arrhythmias. His blood work showed normal renal function and liver enzymes.

The patient was placed on a beta-blocker medication to optimize his cardiac function prior to surgery. He also received aspirin and statins for cardiovascular protection. In addition, his diabetes control was optimized with the help of the endocrinology team.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He remained intubated for 24 hours and was extubated without complications. The patient received intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and pain medications as per protocol.

His postoperative course was uncomplicated, with stable vital signs and no signs of infection. Chest X-rays did not show any evidence of pulmonary complications. The patient started ambulation on the first postoperative day under the supervision of physical therapy. He tolerated the early mobilization well.

The patient's pain was managed effectively with a combination of IV opioids and non-opioid analgesics. His glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin was administered to maintain a target blood sugar range. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

Regarding complications, the patient did not develop any surgical site infections or wound complications. He did not experience any major bleeding requiring transfusions. There were no postoperative arrhythmias or cardiac ischemic events.

Overall, the patient had a successful postoperative course without any complications. His cardiac function improved post-surgery, as evidenced by an increased ejection fraction on subsequent echocardiograms. The patient was discharged home after six days in the hospital, with appropriate postoperative instructions and follow-up appointments.
