Patient X is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, controlled with medications. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. 

His medical history includes a previous appendectomy at the age of 40 with an uneventful postoperative course. He is a non-smoker and denies any history of respiratory conditions. He has been taking lisinopril for hypertension and metformin for diabetes for the past five years, with good control of his blood pressure and blood glucose levels.

During the preoperative evaluation, his laboratory tests revealed a well-controlled glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% and a normal renal function with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. His blood pressure was stable at 130/80 mmHg, and he had no signs of end-organ damage.

The patient underwent the surgery without any complications. General anesthesia was administered, and the operation lasted for approximately 1 hour. Intraoperatively, no bleeding or other intra-abdominal abnormalities were noted. The hernia repair was performed using a tension-free mesh technique. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room without any issues.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room and later transferred to the surgical ward. He was started on intravenous fluids and received regular doses of analgesics for pain management. The surgical wound was assessed, and it showed clean, dry, and intact dressing.

Over the next few days, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He had no signs of wound infection, no fever, and no respiratory complications. His pain was well-controlled with oral analgesics, and he started ambulating without difficulty. The patient was instructed to resume his regular diabetic and hypertensive medications postoperatively, as they were held during the surgery.

No complications, including acute renal failure, were observed during the postoperative period. The patient's renal function remained stable, with no significant changes in the serum creatinine levels. He was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with a prescription for oral pain medication and instructions to follow up with his surgeon in two weeks for wound assessment. In the discharge summary, it was emphasized to continue with his regular medications and report any signs of infection or worsening pain.

In conclusion, patient X, a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, underwent an uneventful inguinal hernia repair without any complications. His postoperative course was smooth, and he was discharged home with appropriate pain management and wound care instructions. The patient is expected to have a good recovery and is advised to follow up as scheduled.
