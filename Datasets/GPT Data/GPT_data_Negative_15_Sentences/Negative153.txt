The patient is a 45-year-old female who has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been compliant with her medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a sulfonylurea. She has been managing her diabetes with diet and exercise, and her most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%.

The patient is scheduled to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. She has been experiencing significant knee pain and functional limitations for the past year. The orthopedic surgeon has recommended surgery to improve her quality of life and mobility.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a comprehensive medical evaluation. Her vital signs were stable, and she had no evidence of acute organ dysfunction. Laboratory tests revealed normal kidney function, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. She did not have any proteinuria or hematuria.

Her preoperative cardiac evaluation included an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm, and an echocardiogram, which revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60%. She had no significant coronary artery disease on her stress test, which was performed six months ago.

The patient received counseling on the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for infection, bleeding, and thrombotic events. She was instructed to stop her oral hypoglycemic medication the night before surgery and provided with clear instructions regarding perioperative glycemic control.

The patient had an uncomplicated surgery and received appropriate intraoperative care. She required a short period of postoperative pain control with opioids but transitioned to non-opioid analgesics successfully. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day, and the patient demonstrated excellent progress in her range of motion and functional abilities.

Her postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of infection or wound complications. She achieved adequate pain control without the need for opioids within one week of surgery. Her blood glucose levels were within the target range during the perioperative period, and she did not experience any significant hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic episodes.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, and she has been pleased with the outcome. She had a smooth recovery and was able to return to her normal activities with improved knee function. There were no postoperative complications related to her medical history or the surgery itself.
