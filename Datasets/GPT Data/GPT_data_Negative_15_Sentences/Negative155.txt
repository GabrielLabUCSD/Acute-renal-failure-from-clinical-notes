The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease, for which he has been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed. He also has a history of hypertension, which is well controlled with a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

The patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, including a physical examination, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel, which were all within normal limits. His renal function, as assessed by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was normal.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and was positioned prone on the operating table. The surgical procedure involved a discectomy and fusion at the L5-S1 level. The procedure went as planned, with no intraoperative complications reported.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was carefully monitored for pain control, infection, and any signs of neurologic deficits. He was given a patient-controlled analgesia pump for pain management and started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no evidence of wound infection or neurologic deficits. He was able to tolerate a regular diet shortly after surgery and was ambulating with assistance. Physical therapy was initiated to help him regain strength and mobility.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3, with a prescription for oral pain medications and instructions for wound care. He was advised to gradually increase his activity level and to avoid heavy lifting for the first six weeks post-surgery.

During the follow-up visit two weeks after surgery, the patient reported satisfactory pain control and no signs of wound infection. His incision site appeared to be healing well, with no signs of inflammation or drainage. He was gradually weaned off opioids and transitioned to over-the-counter analgesics.

At the six-week follow-up appointment, the patient demonstrated excellent progress in terms of pain relief and functional improvement. He had resumed his normal daily activities, including light exercise, without any major discomfort. Repeat imaging showed adequate fusion at the operated level.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, and he did not experience any significant complications related to the surgery. He continued to follow up with his primary care physician for the management of his underlying hypertension and periodic evaluation of his back pain.
