The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient had a heart attack six years ago and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery at that time.

He currently takes several medications including Lisinopril for blood pressure control, Metformin for diabetes management, and Atorvastatin for cholesterol control. The patient reports good compliance with his medications and follows a healthy diet and exercise routine.

On physical examination, the patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but his glucose levels are slightly elevated. He has no significant cardiovascular or respiratory findings, and his surgical site from the previous CABG is well-healed.

Preoperative laboratory tests show normal renal function, liver function, and hemoglobin levels. There are no significant abnormalities on the electrocardiogram or chest X-ray.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the night before surgery for monitoring and fasting. He received appropriate preoperative counseling and consent. The surgical procedure performed was a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He was closely monitored for pain control, vital signs, and wound healing. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote mobility and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's pain was adequately managed with a combination of oral analgesics and local pain control techniques. He followed the physical therapy regimen and gradually regained mobility and functional independence.

No complications were documented during the patient's postoperative period. His wound healed well without any signs of infection. He did not experience any cardiovascular or respiratory complications, and his blood sugar levels remained stable throughout the hospital stay.

Overall, the patient's surgical outcome was successful, with no complications reported. He was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate pain medication, instructions for wound care, and a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess his progress.
