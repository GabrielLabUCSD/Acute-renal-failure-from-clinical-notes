The patient is a 52-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for the treatment of a herniated disc in his lower back. He has a history of chronic lower back pain for the past five years, which has been managed with physical therapy, pain medications, and epidural steroid injections. The patient's pain is exacerbated by prolonged standing or sitting, and he also experiences numbness and tingling in his legs.

The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He has never had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease, with his father having had a myocardial infarction in his 50s.

In preparation for surgery, the patient has had a comprehensive preoperative assessment, including blood tests, a chest X-ray, and an electrocardiogram, which were all within normal limits. He has been advised to discontinue any blood-thinning medications and to avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight the night before surgery.

The surgical procedure will involve a microdiscectomy, which is a minimally invasive technique where a small portion of the herniated disc is removed to relieve pressure on the nerve roots. The procedure is expected to take about one to two hours, and the patient will be under general anesthesia. He will be closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit immediately after the surgery.

Following the surgery, the patient will be encouraged to walk and perform gentle exercises to promote circulation and prevent blood clots. A physical therapist will be involved in his care to guide him through the appropriate rehabilitation program. Pain medications will be prescribed to manage postoperative discomfort, and the patient will be instructed on how to care for his incision site.

In the postoperative course, the patient tolerated the surgery well and had no immediate complications. His pain levels gradually decreased, and he reported improved sensation and decrease in numbness in his legs. He was able to ambulate with minimal assistance and resumed a regular diet.

Throughout his recovery, the patient received regular follow-up care to assess his progress and ensure optimal healing. He complied with his medication regimen and attended scheduled physical therapy sessions. He reported minimal pain during his follow-up visits and had a significant improvement in his quality of life.

At the three-month postoperative visit, the patient continued to report sustained improvement in his back pain, with resolution of his previous symptoms. His incision site was well-healed, and there were no signs of infection. He was advised to continue with regular exercise and back-strengthening activities to maintain long-term benefits from the surgery.

In summary, the patient is a 52-year-old male with chronic lower back pain due to a herniated disc. He underwent a microdiscectomy, which was successful in relieving his pain and improving his leg symptoms. The patient had no complications during the postoperative period and experienced a smooth recovery. He continues to do well at his three-month follow-up and is encouraged to maintain his exercise routine for long-term benefit.
