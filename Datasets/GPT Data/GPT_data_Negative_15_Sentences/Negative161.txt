The patient is a 45-year-old female who is planning to have surgery. She has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. Her hypertension is well-controlled with a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, and her diabetes is managed with metformin. Her hyperlipidemia is controlled with atorvastatin. She takes acetaminophen and naproxen as needed for her osteoarthritis pain.

She had a myocardial infarction three years ago, for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. She has no residual angina and her stress test was negative. She is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.

In terms of social history, she is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. She lives with her husband and has a sedentary lifestyle.

The patient underwent preoperative evaluation which included a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. A chest x-ray was also performed. All the results were within normal limits.

The patient received preoperative education about surgery preparation, including fasting instructions and medication management.

Postoperatively, the patient's course was uneventful. She tolerated the surgery well and her pain was adequately controlled with intravenous opioids in the immediate postoperative period. She was able to ambulate with assistance and had no signs of wound infection or other surgical complications.

She was carefully monitored for any signs of complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. However, she did not develop any of these complications.

Throughout her hospital stay, her blood glucose levels were monitored closely to ensure they remained within the target range. Her medications were adjusted accordingly to maintain glycemic control.

The patient's postoperative recovery was satisfactory, and she was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate instructions for wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. She was advised to follow up with her primary care physician and surgeon for further evaluation and monitoring.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery with no immediate complications. However, long-term follow-up is recommended to ensure proper management of her chronic medical conditions.
