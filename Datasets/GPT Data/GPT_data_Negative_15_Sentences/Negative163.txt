The patient is a 50-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with symptoms of worsening knee pain and difficulty walking due to advanced osteoarthritis. Conservative management, including physical therapy and analgesics, has been tried without significant improvement. As a result, the patient has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient was evaluated by an anesthesiologist and underwent a thorough medical examination. Laboratory investigations including blood counts, renal and liver function tests, and coagulation profile were within normal limits. His blood pressure was well-controlled on antihypertensive medications, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were within target range, indicating good diabetes control. Preoperative radiographs of the affected knee showed advanced degenerative changes with loss of joint space.

The patient underwent elective total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure was accomplished without any intraoperative complications. He received adequate pain management through a combination of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room and later transferred to a specialized orthopedic ward. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics and graduated exercise and physiotherapy regimen to facilitate early mobilization and rehabilitation. Despite the expected postoperative pain, his pain was well-controlled with medications, and he exhibited no signs of wound infection or hematoma formation.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin was adjusted as necessary to maintain euglycemia. On the second postoperative day, the patient was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist using a walker. He demonstrated good range of motion and reported decreased pain compared to preoperatively.

During his hospitalization, the patient did not experience any complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, wound dehiscence, or cardiac events. His surgical wound remained clean and intact, without signs of infection. The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with a prescription for pain medication and an outpatient physical therapy plan.

In the following weeks, the patient continued with his physical therapy exercises and gradually regained strength and mobility. He attended regular follow-up appointments with his orthopedic surgeon, who was pleased with his progress. The patient reported significant improvement in pain and functional capacity compared to before the surgery.

In summary, the 50-year-old male patient with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent an uncomplicated total knee replacement surgery. His postoperative course was marked by effective pain management, early mobilization, and successful wound healing. He did not experience any significant complications. The patient demonstrated good adherence to the postoperative rehabilitation plan and achieved positive outcomes in terms of pain relief and functional improvement.
