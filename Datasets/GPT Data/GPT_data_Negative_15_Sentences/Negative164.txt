The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for bladder cancer. He has a history of smoking for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. He has a significant family history of cancer, including his mother who had breast cancer and his father who had lung cancer. The patient underwent previous transurethral resections of bladder tumors (TURBT) for the management of non-invasive bladder cancer. He completed a course of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy without any complications.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, which is controlled with lisinopril. He had an episode of atrial fibrillation 3 years ago, for which he takes warfarin. The patient has been compliant with his medications and has regular follow-up with his primary care physician and cardiologist.

On physical examination, the patient is in good general health. His blood pressure is within normal limits, and his heart rhythm is regular. The patient does not have any signs of fluid overload or congestive heart failure. A baseline electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed, which showed normal sinus rhythm and normal left ventricular function, respectively.

Preoperative laboratory tests were conducted and showed a complete blood count within normal limits, including hemoglobin and platelet counts. Renal function tests were also within normal limits, and the patient did not have any evidence of acute renal failure. Liver function tests, coagulation studies, and electrolyte levels were all within normal limits.

The patient underwent surgery without any intraoperative complications. He tolerated the procedure well and did not experience any adverse events like bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia. The surgery was successful in removing the bladder tumor, and the patient was closely monitored during his postoperative course.

In the postoperative period, the patient experienced some pain and discomfort, which were managed with appropriate analgesics. He was encouraged to mobilize and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

During his hospital stay, the patient developed a urinary tract infection, which was treated with antibiotics. He did not develop any other postoperative complications such as wound infection, deep surgical site infection, or sepsis. His recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged home after five days of hospitalization.

The patient was given appropriate postoperative instructions, including wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments. He was advised to continue his regular medications for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. The patient understood the importance of follow-up care and was compliant with his postoperative instructions.

In conclusion, the patient, a 45-year-old male with a history of smoking and bladder cancer, successfully underwent surgery without any intraoperative complications. He did develop a postoperative urinary tract infection but otherwise had an uneventful recovery. The patient was discharged home and will continue to be closely monitored during his follow-up appointments.
