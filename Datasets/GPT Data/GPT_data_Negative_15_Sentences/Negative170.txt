The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She presents to the clinic today for preoperative evaluation as she is scheduled to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement. The patient reports significant knee pain and stiffness that has progressively worsened over the past two years, leading to limitations in her daily activities.

In relation to her medical history, the patient's blood pressure is generally well-controlled on lisinopril, and her most recent lipid panel showed well-managed cholesterol levels on atorvastatin. Her blood glucose levels are also within target range on metformin.

The patient reports no known drug allergies and is not currently taking any over-the-counter or herbal medications. She denies smoking but admits to consuming alcohol occasionally. She has had no recent hospitalizations or surgeries and has not experienced any significant infections.

She undergoes a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, including a physical examination, laboratory tests (complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation profile), ECG, and chest X-ray. Her physical examination reveals obesity and bilateral knee pain with restricted range of motion. Lab tests are within normal limits, and the ECG shows normal sinus rhythm. The chest X-ray also appears unremarkable.

The patient is considered to be at average surgical risk based on her medical history, with her chronic conditions being well-managed and controlled. She is given instructions regarding fasting and medication management before surgery and is advised to continue her usual antihypertensive, antilipidemic, and antidiabetic medications up until the morning of the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient is transferred to the recovery unit where she is closely monitored for pain control and wound healing. Physical therapy is initiated to facilitate early mobilization and rehabilitation. She is started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

Throughout her postoperative course, the patient experiences excellent pain relief with the administration of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She demonstrates good compliance with physical therapy exercises and achieves gradual improvement in her knee mobility and function.

Fortunately, there are no notable complications during the patient's postoperative course. Her wound heals well without signs of infection, and she does not develop any deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Lab tests remain within normal limits, including her renal function markers.

In conclusion, this patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is scheduled for total knee replacement surgery. Her preoperative evaluation is unremarkable, and she is considered to be at average surgical risk. Following surgery, the patient has an uneventful postoperative course, experiencing good pain control and successful rehabilitation without any complications.
