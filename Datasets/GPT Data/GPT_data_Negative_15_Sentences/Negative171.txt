The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been maintained on medications, including amlodipine and atorvastatin, for the past 5 years. He has had no significant cardiac events in the past.

The patient presented with worsening knee pain and was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis. Conservative management was attempted, including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement in symptoms. Therefore, the decision was made to proceed with a total knee replacement surgery.

Pre-operative investigations revealed normal renal function, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. His blood pressure was well controlled, averaging around 130/80 mmHg.

The patient underwent the total knee replacement surgery without any complications. The procedure lasted approximately 2 hours, and the surgical team reported no intraoperative difficulties. Postoperatively, the patient was started on pain control medications, including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

During the postoperative course, the patient experienced typical symptoms of swelling, pain, and limited range of motion in the knee joint. However, these symptoms gradually improved with time and appropriate physical therapy. He was able to bear weight and walk with the assistance of a walker by postoperative day 3.

There were no signs of fever, infection, or wound-related complications. The patient's incision site remained clean and dry, and there were no signs of dehiscence. He was given prophylactic antibiotics, consistent with best practice guidelines, to prevent any surgical site infections.

Regular physical therapy sessions were provided to improve the patient's range of motion and strength. The patient was also instructed on proper wound care and emphasized the importance of infection prevention.

The patient's pain was well managed throughout the postoperative period. He reported pain levels of 2-3 out of 10 on a visual analog scale, which was considered satisfactory. The patient was able to wean off opioids and transition to non-opioid pain medications within the first week after surgery.

Follow-up visits were scheduled at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks post-surgery. At the 2-week follow-up, the patient had improved mobility and range of motion compared to the preoperative state. His wound had completely healed without any signs of infection or complications.

In summary, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery without any major complications. The postoperative course was uneventful, with gradual improvement in pain, range of motion, and functionality of the knee joint. Regular follow-up visits were planned to monitor the patient's progress and ensure optimal recovery.
