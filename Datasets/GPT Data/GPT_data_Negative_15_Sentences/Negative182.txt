The patient is a 60-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes. His hypertension is well controlled with lisinopril, and his thyroid function is well regulated with levothyroxine. His diabetes is managed with metformin and diet modifications.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone a cholecystectomy for gallstone disease and a total knee replacement due to osteoarthritis. Both procedures were uneventful, and the patient recovered well without any complications.

The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, indicating that he is overweight. He has been advised to lose weight prior to the surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative complications. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly.

The patient's preoperative laboratory investigations show normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. However, he has albuminuria, with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 mg/g, indicating early-stage kidney disease. He has been referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and treatment.

During the postoperative course, the patient experienced moderately severe pain at the surgical site, but it was managed effectively with opioid analgesics. He received prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively to prevent surgical site infection, and no signs of infection were observed during the recovery period.

The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively, with no significant changes in creatinine levels. However, he did develop postoperative urinary retention, which was managed with intermittent catheterization until he regained normal bladder function.

In terms of mobilization, the patient was encouraged to ambulate early after surgery to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He complied with the recommendations and did not require any additional interventions for blood clot prevention.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, except for the urinary retention. He was discharged home on the fifth day after surgery with appropriate pain management instructions and a plan for further follow-up with his primary care physician. The patient was advised to continue his regular medications and to monitor his blood glucose levels closely during the recovery period. He was also instructed to follow up with the nephrologist regarding his kidney disease.
