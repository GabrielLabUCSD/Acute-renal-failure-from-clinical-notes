The patient is a 47-year-old male who has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for bilateral knee replacements. He has been experiencing severe pain and limited mobility in both knees for the past three years, which has significantly affected his quality of life. His hypertension is well-controlled with medication, and his diabetes is managed with diet and exercise.

In his preoperative evaluation, his laboratory results were within normal limits, including his kidney function tests. He does not have a history of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. His creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient has undergone all necessary preoperative assessments, including an EKG to evaluate his cardiac function, chest X-ray, and consultations with the anesthesiologist. He has been instructed to stop taking anticoagulant medication seven days prior to the surgery.

The surgery took place without complications. The patient received general anesthesia, and the procedure lasted approximately two hours. Both knees were successfully replaced, and the patient tolerated the surgery well.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. He was given appropriate pain medications and was mobilized with the assistance of physical therapy. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis was initiated, including the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices and early ambulation.

During his hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he had no signs of infection or wound complications. His pain was adequately managed with oral analgesics.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day three. He was instructed to continue with physical therapy and pain medication as prescribed. A follow-up appointment was scheduled with his surgeon in two weeks to assess his progress.

At the follow-up appointment, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and mobility. He was able to walk with the assistance of a cane and perform daily activities with less difficulty. His surgical wounds were healing well without any signs of infection. No complications, including acute renal failure, were noted during the postoperative period. He was advised to continue with physical therapy and gradually increase his activity level. Another follow-up visit was scheduled for six weeks after surgery to assess long-term outcomes.
