The patient is a 50-year-old male who has a significant medical history. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. His hypertension is controlled with a combination of medications including lisinopril, metoprolol, and hydrochlorothiazide. He takes metformin and sitagliptin for his diabetes management. He has undergone a previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery for his coronary artery disease.

The patient is currently scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in his left knee. He has been experiencing significant pain and difficulty with ambulation, and conservative measures have been unsuccessful in managing his symptoms.

His surgical team conducted a thorough preoperative assessment, which included a detailed review of his medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. The patient's preoperative laboratory findings were within normal limits, including his complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and renal function. His hemoglobin A1C level was well-controlled, indicating good diabetes management.

The patient was deemed suitable for surgery and was provided with detailed instructions regarding preoperative fasting and medication management. He was instructed to withhold his antihypertensive medications on the morning of surgery but to continue taking his diabetic medications with a sip of water.

Following the surgical procedure, the patient's postoperative course was monitored closely. He experienced expected temporary pain and swelling at the surgical site, which was managed effectively with pain medications and ice packs. His blood pressure remained stable throughout the postoperative period, and no signs of infection or wound complications were observed.

The patient was mobilized with the assistance of physical therapy on the day of surgery itself. He gradually progressed from using a walker to a cane for ambulation. His physical therapy sessions focused on range of motion exercises, strengthening exercises, and gait training.

During his postoperative stay, the patient's blood glucose levels were monitored regularly to ensure optimal glycemic control. Adjustments were made to his diabetic medications, and his blood sugar levels remained within the target range.

The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or surgical site infection. He was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day with a prescription for pain medications and specific instructions regarding wound care, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments.

Upon follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his knee pain and functional ability. He was able to perform activities of daily living with minimal discomfort and was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery.

In conclusion, this patient's medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He underwent elective total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis and had an uneventful postoperative course without complications. The surgery successfully alleviated his pain and improved his functional ability.
