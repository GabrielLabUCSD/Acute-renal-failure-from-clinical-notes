The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 2), hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. His blood pressure is currently well-controlled on lisinopril 10 mg daily, and his diabetes is managed with insulin glargine 30 units once daily and insulin aspart before meals.

He has a BMI of 30, indicating he is overweight. His recent lipid panel revealed elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol but normal high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. He is taking atorvastatin 20 mg daily to manage his hyperlipidemia.

The patient has a history of smoking for 20 years, but he quit 10 years ago. He is interested in quitting alcohol but currently consumes moderate amounts occasionally.

His surgical procedure is scheduled due to the diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis, which has been causing recurrent episodes of biliary colic. He has not experienced any complications related to his gallstones, such as cholecystitis or pancreatitis.

The patient's preoperative laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and coagulation studies, are within normal limits.

During his postoperative course, he experienced moderate pain at the surgical site, which was managed with intravenous morphine. His vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, remained stable throughout his recovery period.

The patient's urine output was monitored closely to assess renal function, and no significant changes or complications were observed. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remained within the normal range at 85 mL/min.

He was encouraged to ambulate early to minimize the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Sequential compression devices were used to assist with venous return and prevent DVT.

The patient was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to regular diet as tolerated. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin adjustments were made accordingly.

No signs of infection or wound complications were noted during his hospital stay. His surgical incision site was clean, dry, and intact.

The patient recovered well and was discharged home on postoperative day 3. He was advised to continue his regular medications and follow up with his primary care physician and surgeon for routine postoperative care.

In summary, this patient with a medical history significant for hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking is scheduled for surgery due to symptomatic cholelithiasis. His postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications noted. His renal function remained unchanged throughout his recovery, and his surgical site showed no signs of infection or wound complications.
