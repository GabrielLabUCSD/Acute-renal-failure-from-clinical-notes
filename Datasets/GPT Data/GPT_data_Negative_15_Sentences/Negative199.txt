Patient X is a 52-year-old female who has a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is currently on metoprolol for blood pressure control and metformin for diabetes management. The patient is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for bilateral knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. She reports chronic knee pain, difficulty walking, and decreased range of motion.

In terms of her surgery preparation, Patient X was evaluated by the anesthesiology team, who deemed her fit for surgery. Preoperatively, a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation studies were performed, all of which were within normal limits. She received appropriate prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery to mitigate the risk of infection.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and had a smooth intraoperative course. The procedure lasted approximately two hours, with no immediate complications reported. Postoperatively, Patient X was closely monitored in the recovery room. She received adequate pain control with a combination of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Her vital signs remained stable, and she did not exhibit any signs of respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability.

In terms of her postoperative course, Patient X was transferred to the orthopedic ward after recovery. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to facilitate early mobilization. She followed a strict regimen of pain management, which included a combination of opioids and non-pharmacological interventions such as ice packs and elevation of the surgical site. Her blood glucose levels were closely monitored to ensure optimal glycemic control.

During her hospital stay, Patient X experienced no postoperative complications. She successfully completed her physical therapy sessions, demonstrating improved range of motion and functional capacity. Her surgical wounds showed appropriate healing progression, and no signs of infection or dehiscence were observed.

In terms of discharge planning, Patient X was provided with instructions for at-home wound care and pain management. She was prescribed a short-term course of oral opioids for pain control post-discharge. Additionally, she was educated on the importance of continuing her regular blood pressure and diabetes medications.

Upon follow-up at the orthopedic clinic two weeks after discharge, Patient X demonstrated satisfactory progress in her recovery. Her knee function continued to improve, and she reported decreasing levels of pain. No further complications were noted, and she was advised to continue with physical therapy and gradually increase her activity level.
