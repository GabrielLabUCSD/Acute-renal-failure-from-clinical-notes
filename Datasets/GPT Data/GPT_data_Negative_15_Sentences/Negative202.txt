The patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and stable angina. He presented with worsening symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion, which prompted further investigation and diagnosis of severe coronary artery disease. After undergoing a cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography revealed three-vessel disease with significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, right coronary artery, and circumflex artery. The decision to proceed with a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was made.

The patient's preoperative evaluation included laboratory investigations such as a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and a lipid panel. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed evidence of significant ST segment changes indicative of myocardial ischemia. As part of the preoperative preparation, the patient was instructed to stop antiplatelet medications and encouraged to quit smoking.

Surgery was performed without any complications. The patient received general anesthesia and was positioned for a standard median sternotomy approach. Multiple bypass grafts were performed on the obstructed coronary arteries, including one to the left anterior descending artery, one to the right coronary artery, and one to the circumflex artery. Intraoperatively, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, and no intraoperative complications were encountered. The surgery lasted approximately four hours.

Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He was extubated within six hours after surgery and was started on a postoperative pain management regimen. Vital signs were stable, and cardiovascular examination revealed no new abnormalities. The patient was ambulated on the second postoperative day and gradually increased his activity level under the supervision of physical therapy.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. He did not experience any major complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or wound infections. Routine laboratory investigations, including daily complete blood counts, and metabolic panels were within normal limits. Chest X-rays showed no signs of atelectasis or pleural effusion.

Given the patient's stable condition following CABG surgery, he was discharged to home on the fifth postoperative day. He received a prescription for dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) and was advised to continue his diabetic and antihypertensive medications. Routine follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his recovery and optimize his long-term cardiovascular health. No complications were reported during the patient's postoperative course.
