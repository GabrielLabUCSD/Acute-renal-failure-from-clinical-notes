The patient is a 57-year-old male who has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently on medication for both conditions and follows up regularly with his primary care physician. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating that he is overweight.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient had a cholecystectomy five years ago due to gallstone disease. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient had an unremarkable postoperative course. He has also undergone hernia repair surgery three years ago, which was also uncomplicated.

The patient is now planning to undergo a total knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis, which has significantly impacted his mobility and quality of life. Prior to surgery, he had tried conservative management options, including physical therapy and pain medications, but did not achieve satisfactory relief.

His preoperative workup has included a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a coagulation profile, which were all within normal limits. He has also been screened for any infections, including a chest x-ray and a urinalysis, and no concerns were identified.

The patient received appropriate preoperative counseling and education about the surgery, including the risks, benefits, and potential complications. He was informed about the importance of maintaining glycemic control and blood pressure management perioperatively.

The knee replacement surgery was performed successfully without any intraoperative complications. The patient received appropriate anesthesia and was closely monitored throughout the procedure. Postoperatively, he was started on pain medications and underwent physical therapy to facilitate early mobilization.

The patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course and achieved satisfactory pain relief. He complied with the prescribed physical therapy and was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker soon after surgery. His blood glucose levels and blood pressure remained stable during the hospital stay.

No major complications were observed during the patient's recovery period. He did not develop any signs of infection, deep vein thrombosis, or wound dehiscence. Respiratory function was appropriate, and he did not require any supplemental oxygen.

His renal function, as assessed by serum creatinine levels, remained stable throughout the postoperative period. He did not experience acute renal failure or any other renal complications.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, and he was discharged on Day 4 postoperatively to continue his recovery at home. He was provided with appropriate discharge instructions, including the importance of continuing physical therapy and adherence to his medication regimen.

The patient will be followed up in the outpatient clinic in two weeks to assess his progress and address any concerns. The primary care physician will continue to manage his chronic medical conditions and adjust medications as needed. The patient will also be referred for long-term physical therapy to optimize his functional outcome and promote his recovery.
