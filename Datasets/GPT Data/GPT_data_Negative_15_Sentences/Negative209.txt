Patient is a 58-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. His medical history includes hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril, and type 2 diabetes, which is well-controlled with metformin. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which he takes atorvastatin. He is a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient's preoperative physical examination is unremarkable except for tenderness over the affected lumbar spine. Laboratory tests reveal a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL and an LDL cholesterol level of 110 mg/dL. His renal function is within normal limits with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. EKG shows normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

In terms of his surgical risk, the patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 30, which classifies him as overweight. However, he has no other significant risk factors for surgical complications such as cardiovascular disease or obstructive sleep apnea. He has been advised to continue taking his regular medications prior to surgery, with the exception of metformin which he will temporarily stop on the day of surgery.

Following the surgery, the patient has an uneventful postoperative course. He is started on analgesics to manage his pain, and physical therapy is initiated to help him regain strength and mobility. The patient is able to tolerate oral intake and his vital signs remain stable. He is discharged home on the second postoperative day with instructions for wound care and a follow-up appointment in one week.

During his follow-up appointment, the patient reports a gradual improvement in his pain and mobility. There are no signs of wound infection or other postoperative complications. The patient is advised to continue physical therapy and restrict heavy lifting for at least six weeks. His pain medications are tapered off gradually as his pain improves, and by the six-week mark, he reports minimal discomfort and is able to resume his regular activities without any limitations.

In summary, the 58-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia underwent successful surgery for a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. He had no significant perioperative complications and experienced an uneventful postoperative course. The patient's pain and mobility gradually improved with conservative management and physical therapy, allowing him to resume his regular activities without any limitations.
