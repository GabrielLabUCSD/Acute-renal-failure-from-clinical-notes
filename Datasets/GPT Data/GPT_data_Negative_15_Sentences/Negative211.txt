The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with severe right knee pain and difficulty ambulating. He has a medical history notable for osteoarthritis and a previous knee surgery five years ago. The patient has been managing his pain symptoms with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy but has experienced a recent worsening of symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, it was determined that a total knee replacement surgery would be necessary to alleviate his pain and improve knee function.

Preoperatively, the patient's vital signs were stable, and baseline laboratory studies, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, were within normal limits. The patient underwent a preoperative anesthesia evaluation and was deemed low risk for surgery. He received appropriate perioperative prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis to minimize the risk of infection and blood clot formation.

The patient underwent an uncomplicated total knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative complications. The surgical procedure was performed under spinal anesthesia, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The surgery involved the removal of the damaged knee joint and replacing it with a prosthetic knee joint made of durable materials.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room for vital signs stability, pain control, and avoidance of complications. He received intravenous pain medications and non-opioid analgesics to manage his pain, and physical therapy was initiated on the same day of surgery to promote early mobility. The patient was mobilized out of bed on the first postoperative day with the assistance of physical therapy and nursing staff.

Throughout his postoperative course, the patient had no signs of infection, such as fever, drainage, or redness at the surgical site. He remained hemodynamically stable, and his wound was clean, dry, and intact. The patient's pain was well controlled with oral analgesics, and he reported a significant improvement in his knee pain and mobility compared to the preoperative state.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any surgical complications, such as wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, or nerve injury during or after the surgery. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on the third postoperative day with appropriate home care instructions and prescriptions for pain management. He continues to follow up with his orthopedic surgeon for routine postoperative visits and physical therapy to optimize his knee function and rehabilitation.
