The patient is a 65-year-old male who has decided to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. The patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including a physical examination, blood tests, and electrocardiogram, which showed controlled blood pressure and blood sugar levels. The surgical team confirmed that the patient was an appropriate candidate for surgery.

The patient's high blood pressure has been well controlled for the past five years with a combination of medication and lifestyle modifications. His diabetes is also well managed with oral medications, and he maintains a healthy diet and exercise routine to control his blood sugar levels. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 34, which puts him in the obese category.

During the exploratory laparoscopy procedure, the surgeon discovered a large hernia requiring a mesh repair. The surgery was successful, without any complications. The patient received general anesthesia and tolerated the procedure well. Postoperatively, the patient was started on intravenous pain medications and closely monitored for any signs of infection or bleeding.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild pain at the incision site, which was effectively managed with oral pain medications. His vital signs remained stable, and he showed no signs of infection or bleeding. The patient ambulated the day after surgery, with assistance from a physical therapist to prevent complications such as blood clots.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day two. He was given detailed instructions regarding wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician within one week post-discharge.

During the follow-up visit, the patient reported minimal pain and had no signs of infection at the wound site. He was advised to gradually increase his activity level and continue with the prescribed pain medications as needed. The patient was also referred to a nutritionist to further address his obesity and develop a long-term weight management plan.

One month after surgery, the patient had completely recovered from the procedure, with no complications noted. His wound had healed well, and he had returned to his normal activities of daily living. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and the overall care received. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and weight management progress.
