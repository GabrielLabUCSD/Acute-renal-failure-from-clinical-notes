The patient, a 55-year-old male, has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, with a BMI of 32. He has been taking medications for his conditions, including lisinopril and atorvastatin. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. 

The patient has been experiencing chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis for the past two years, which has significantly affected his mobility and quality of life. Conservative treatment options, including physical therapy and pain medication, have been unsuccessful in providing relief. 

After careful consideration and consultation with an orthopedic surgeon, the patient has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery in his left knee. Prior to the surgery, he underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood tests, EKG, and chest x-ray, which revealed no contraindications for the procedure. 

During the surgery, the joint was successfully replaced with a prosthetic implant. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery unit in stable condition. 

In the postoperative course, the patient received pain control with a combination of intravenous opioids and oral analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote joint mobility and function. The patient was able to bear full weight on his left leg with the assistance of a walker.

Complications that arose during the postoperative period include a superficial surgical site infection, which was managed with wound care and antibiotics. Additionally, the patient experienced temporary swelling and numbness around the surgical site, which gradually improved over time. 

To prevent blood clot formation, the patient was started on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin. He also received sequential compression devices on both legs to enhance blood circulation. 

The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day three. During the follow-up visit, two weeks after discharge, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in pain and overall mobility. The surgical wound had healed well, and there were no signs of infection or other complications. 

Overall, despite the superficial surgical site infection, the patient's postoperative course was successful, with a significant improvement in pain and mobility. With continued physical therapy and adherence to a healthy lifestyle, the patient is expected to achieve a full recovery and regain his quality of life.
