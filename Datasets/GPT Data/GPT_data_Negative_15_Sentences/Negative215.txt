The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managed on multiple oral medications for these conditions. He is a non-smoker but consumes alcohol occasionally. The patient is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair and has been cleared by the anesthesiologist for the procedure.

The patient's preoperative laboratory results reveal a baseline creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%, and LDL cholesterol of 120 mg/dL. His blood pressure control has been stable with a current reading of 130/80 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings and his surgical risk is considered low. The patient has been educated on the surgery, risks, and postoperative expectations.

During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia without complications. The procedure involved an open approach, with the hernia successfully repaired. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was started on a regular diet the same day. He received appropriate pain control and was ambulated on postoperative day 1.

In the postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remained stable and he reported minimal pain. He resumed his regular home medications, including antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications. His blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and his oral medications were adjusted as needed to maintain glycemic control.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, without any signs of infection or wound complications. He was discharged on postoperative day 2 with instructions for wound care and potential signs of surgical site infection. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with the surgeon in two weeks and with his primary care physician for routine diabetes and hypertension management.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any acute renal failure related to the surgical procedure or anesthetic management. He did not develop any postoperative infections, hematomas, or other surgical site complications. The patient appeared satisfied with his postoperative recovery and reported no significant issues since discharge.
