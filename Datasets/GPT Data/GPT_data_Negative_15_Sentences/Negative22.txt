Patient X is a 54-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery due to chronic back pain caused by degenerative disc disease. His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has a history of smoking, with a 30-pack-year history. The patient's preoperative evaluation indicated that he is on medication for his comorbidities, including metoprolol for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and a statin for hyperlipidemia.

Patient X has undergone multiple conservative treatments for his chronic back pain, including physical therapy, pain medication, and steroid injections, with limited success. His surgeon has recommended a lumbar spinal fusion to alleviate his pain and improve his quality of life. The patient's preoperative radiological imaging confirms the presence of degenerative changes in his lumbar spine.

Following the surgical consultation, Patient X has consented to the procedure and his surgery has been scheduled. He is advised to discontinue his metformin and continue metoprolol up to the day of surgery. The patient has been informed of potential surgical risks and postoperative rehabilitation, including the need for physical therapy. He has been advised to stop smoking to improve his surgical outcomes.

On the day of surgery, Patient X is admitted to the hospital and undergoes lumbar spinal fusion. The surgery is successful, with no intraoperative complications reported. The patient is closely monitored during the postoperative period for pain control, wound healing, and prevention of deep vein thrombosis. He is also started on prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the risk of infection.

During his recovery, Patient X experiences mild postoperative pain but is effectively managed with analgesic medications. Physical therapy is initiated to promote early mobilization and encourage functional independence. The patient demonstrates good compliance with the rehabilitation program and gradually gains strength and mobility.

Patient X's postoperative course remains uneventful, and he is discharged from the hospital on postoperative day four. He is provided with instructions for wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments. The patient is also referred to a smoking cessation program to support his ongoing efforts to quit smoking.

No major postoperative complications, such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or postoperative bleeding, are reported for Patient X. His surgical wound heals well without signs of infection. However, it is important to note that acute renal failure is not observed as a complication in this case.

In conclusion, Patient X, a 54-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, has successfully undergone lumbar spinal fusion surgery for chronic back pain caused by degenerative disc disease. He demonstrates excellent postoperative recovery, adheres to physical therapy, and is discharged without any major complications. The patient's surgical outcome is promising, and he is encouraged to continue his smoking cessation efforts and maintain a healthy lifestyle to optimize his overall health.
