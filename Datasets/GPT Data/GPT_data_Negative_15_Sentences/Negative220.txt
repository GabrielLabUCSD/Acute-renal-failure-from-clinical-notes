He currently takes medications including lisinopril for blood pressure control, metformin for diabetes management, and atorvastatin for cholesterol regulation.

Regarding his surgical history, Patient X has previously undergone a cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease and a knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis. Both procedures were uneventful, and the patient recovered well without any complications.

In terms of his social history, Patient X is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. He is retired and lives with his wife, with whom he reports having a supportive relationship. He is adherent to his medications, exercises regularly, and follows a healthy diet.

Laboratory studies reveal a well-controlled HbA1c level of 6.4%, indicating good glucose control. His lipid profile shows LDL cholesterol levels within the target range at 90 mg/dL. His renal function is normal with a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.

An ECG shows occasional premature ventricular contractions, but no evidence of acute cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias. His echocardiogram demonstrates preserved left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%.

In preparation for surgery, Patient X has undergone a preoperative clearance visit with his primary care physician and has been deemed medically fit for the procedure. He has also been advised on the importance of discontinuing non-essential medications prior to surgery, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Following surgery, Patient X had an unremarkable postoperative course. He recovered without any major complications such as wound infections or deep vein thrombosis.
