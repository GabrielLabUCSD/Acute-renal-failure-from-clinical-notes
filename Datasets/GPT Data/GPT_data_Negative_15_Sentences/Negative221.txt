The patient has been advised about the potential risks of surgery, including infection, bleeding, and risks associated with general anesthesia. He has also been instructed to stop taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anticoagulants prior to surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding. 

In the postoperative course, the patient was initially started on intravenous fluids for hydration and received postoperative analgesia as needed. He tolerated the surgery well without any intraoperative complications. 

The patient's pain was adequately controlled with oral analgesics and he was able to ambulate with minimal assistance. His incision site was monitored for signs of infection, but no significant issues were observed.
