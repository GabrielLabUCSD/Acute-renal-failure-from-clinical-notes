The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has been on a regimen of metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin for the management of these conditions. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 28, indicating he is overweight.

The patient presents with severe knee pain due to osteoarthritis and has been recommended knee replacement surgery by an orthopedic surgeon. He has undergone various conservative measures, such as physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, but with minimal relief.

His preoperative laboratory workup shows well-controlled blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid levels. His renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient has provided informed consent for the surgery, understanding the risks involved, including infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and adverse anesthesia reactions. He has been instructed to stop taking NSAIDs and aspirin seven days prior to surgery to minimize bleeding risk.

On the day of surgery, the patient is brought to the operating room and undergoes general anesthesia. The orthopedic surgeon performs a total knee replacement successfully, and the patient is transferred to the recovery room.

During the postoperative period, the patient is closely monitored for signs of infection, thromboembolism, and respiratory complications. He receives postoperative pain management with a combination of opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

Over the next few days, the patient's knee pain gradually improves, and he is able to mobilize with the assistance of physical therapy. His vital signs remain stable, and wound healing progresses without any signs of infection.

The patient is discharged on the fourth postoperative day with appropriate pain medications, prophylactic anticoagulation, and a plan for outpatient physical therapy. Instructions for postoperative wound care and signs of infection are also provided.

Throughout the following weeks, the patient continues his rehabilitation and experiences excellent progress in overall knee function. He adheres to the prescribed medication regimen and attends all scheduled follow-up appointments.

There were no immediate postoperative complications observed. The patient did not develop any signs of infection, thromboembolism, or respiratory complications. His renal function remained stable, with no evidence of acute renal failure. The surgery proved to be successful in relieving the patient's knee pain, allowing him to regain functionality and improve his quality of life.
