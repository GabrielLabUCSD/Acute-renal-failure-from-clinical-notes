The patient is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for the treatment of a chronic knee injury. The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He takes medications including lisinopril for his blood pressure, atorvastatin to manage his cholesterol levels, and metformin to control his blood sugar.

The patient's surgical procedure involves arthroscopic repair of the torn ligaments in his right knee. He has previously tried conservative management options such as physical therapy and NSAIDs, but they have failed to provide long-term relief. The patient does not have a history of allergies or previous surgeries.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 beats per minute. Laboratory results showed a fasting blood glucose level of 135 mg/dL and a total cholesterol level of 180 mg/dL. His hemoglobin A1c level was 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control.

The patient has been counseled on the importance of medication management around the time of surgery. His antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications will be continued up until the morning of surgery. However, he will be advised to hold his atorvastatin for 48 hours before the procedure.

In the postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for pain control and wound healing. He received postoperative analgesia with oral opioids and scheduled acetaminophen. Physical therapy was initiated on the first day after surgery to promote mobility and strengthen the muscles around the knee joint.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications related to the surgery. The surgical incision healed well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. He was able to achieve adequate pain relief and functional improvement with the prescribed therapy.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3, after demonstrating good mobility and ability to perform activities of daily living. He was instructed to continue with physical therapy as an outpatient and to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a routine wound check and medication management.

It is important to note that the patient did not develop any complications related to the surgery, including acute renal failure. He was compliant with his postoperative instructions and achieved satisfactory outcomes in terms of pain control and functional recovery. The patient's underlying medical conditions were well-managed during the perioperative period, contributing to a successful surgical outcome.
