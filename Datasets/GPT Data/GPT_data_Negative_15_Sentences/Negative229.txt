The patient is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to have surgery. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. His blood pressure is well controlled with a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, while his cholesterol is managed with atorvastatin. He takes metformin and glipizide for diabetes management.

The patient has a past surgical history significant for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery five years ago, which was uneventful. He has not had any subsequent cardiac events or need for further intervention since then. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram performed within the last year have revealed stable cardiac function, with a preserved ejection fraction of 60%.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of osteoarthritis in both knees, leading to chronic knee pain and functional limitations. Conservative treatment measures, including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), have been unsuccessful in providing adequate pain relief. Therefore, the patient has elected to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Following surgery, the patient had an unremarkable postoperative course. Vital signs were stable, and his pain was managed with a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics. He received prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively and had no signs of infection at the surgical site. Physical therapy was promptly initiated to aid in early mobilization and regain strength.

Although this patient's postoperative course was generally smooth, he did experience a temporary decline in kidney function. However, it did not meet the criteria for acute renal failure. His serum creatinine levels peaked at 1.5 mg/dL on postoperative day 2, but gradually decreased over the following days, returning to baseline by postoperative day 7. This transient decline was likely due to intraoperative and postoperative factors, such as hypovolemia and perioperative medications.

In conclusion, this 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease underwent uneventful total knee replacement surgery. His postoperative course was generally smooth, with stable vital signs, well-controlled pain, and appropriate early mobilization. Although he experienced a temporary decline in kidney function, it did not reach the criteria for acute renal failure and resolved in a timely manner.
