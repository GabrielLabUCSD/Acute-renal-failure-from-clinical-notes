The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to have surgery, without any specific mention of the surgical procedure. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been on medications including lisinopril, simvastatin, metformin, and tiotropium bromide. The patient has a history of smoking with a 30 pack-year history, but he quit 10 years ago. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.

Upon physical examination, the patient is found to have a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Lung auscultation reveals mild wheezing bilaterally. The remainder of his examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory investigations show stable renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL (baseline 0.8 mg/dL) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73m^2. Other routine lab values including liver function tests, complete blood count, and coagulation profile are within normal limits.

The patient is scheduled for surgery, and perioperative management includes holding his antihypertensive medication on the day of surgery. He is encouraged to use his bronchodilator inhaler preoperatively. Standard preoperative laboratory workup is done, including an EKG, which shows normal sinus rhythm.

The surgery goes as planned without any intraoperative complications. The patient receives general anesthesia and is intubated for the procedure. Postoperative pain is managed with patient-controlled analgesia using opioids, and he is closely monitored for any signs of respiratory depression.

In the immediate postoperative course, the patient is stable and his blood pressure remains within acceptable range. He is able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulate without difficulty. Respiratory function is assessed regularly, and he continues to receive his bronchodilator inhaler as needed.

The patient is discharged home on the third postoperative day without any complications. He is advised to continue his regular medications and follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and surgical team. He is recommended to undergo pulmonary rehabilitation to improve his lung function following surgery.

In summary, this 65-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and COPD is planning to have surgery. His renal function is stable, and he has undergone a routine preoperative workup. The surgery is uneventful, and the patient has an uncomplicated postoperative course, without any specific complications mentioned.
