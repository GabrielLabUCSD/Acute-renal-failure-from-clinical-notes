Patient X, a 65-year-old male, has a significant medical history leading up to his planned surgery. He has a long-standing history of hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril 10 mg daily. He also has a past history of type 2 diabetes, well-controlled with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. Patient X is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history and quit smoking 5 years ago. He has a sedentary lifestyle and is overweight with a body mass index of 32.

In terms of cardiovascular history, patient X has a previous myocardial infarction 10 years ago, for which he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The grafts have remained patent, and he has no residual angina. His most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50%.

Patient X also has a prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg 2 years ago. He was treated with anticoagulation therapy followed by 6 months of warfarin, and he has not experienced any further episodes. He does not have a known bleeding disorder.

His preoperative laboratory values are within normal limits, including a hemoglobin level of 14 g/dL and a platelet count of 200,000/microliter. His renal function is normal, with a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL. 

Patient X has been scheduled for an elective orthopedic surgery involving a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. The procedure is planned to be performed under general anesthesia and with the use of prophylactic antibiotics. He is NPO after midnight and receives appropriate preoperative counseling.

Following the surgery, patient X's postoperative course is uneventful, with no signs of immediate complications such as wound infection or surgical site bleeding. He is started on prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin to prevent DVT. Physical therapy is initiated on the first postoperative day to help with early mobilization.

Patient X's recovery progresses well, and he is discharged home after 3 days with appropriate pain management and a rehabilitation plan. He is advised to continue his regular medications, including lisinopril and metformin. Routine follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor his wound healing and progress. Patient X does not experience any complications during the postoperative period, although pain and discomfort are to be expected during the recovery process.
