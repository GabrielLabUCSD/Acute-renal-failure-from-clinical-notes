The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes lisinopril and simvastatin. He also has a history of tobacco use, smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. The patient denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's physical exam revealed a well-nourished individual with a body mass index of 27. His vital signs were within normal limits, and his cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. Laboratory findings showed normal complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests. His renal function was also within normal limits, with a estimated glomerular filtration rate of 90 ml/min/1.73mÂ² (MDRD).

The patient was cleared for surgery by the anesthesiology team. He was instructed to continue taking his antihypertensive medication on the morning of the procedure with a sip of water. He was advised to hold his simvastatin for 48 hours prior to surgery.

The patient underwent elective hernia repair without any intraoperative complications. He received general anesthesia and was intubated for the procedure. The surgery lasted approximately 50 minutes, and the patient was extubated successfully in the operating room. He was then transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring.

In the PACU, the patient's vital signs remained stable. He was able to tolerate oral intake and manage his pain with oral analgesics. There were no signs of infection or wound complications noted. The patient was discharged home on the same day with postoperative instructions, including wound care and activity restrictions.

During the postoperative course, the patient experienced mild pain at the surgical site, which was managed with over-the-counter analgesics. He followed up with his surgeon one week after surgery, where his wound was found to be healing well without signs of infection. The patient reported no complications or concerns during this visit. He was advised to gradually resume his regular activities and to return for a follow-up appointment in four weeks.

In summary, the patient underwent successful hernia repair surgery without any intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. He had a smooth recovery without any signs of infection or wound complications. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he is expected to have a good long-term outcome.
