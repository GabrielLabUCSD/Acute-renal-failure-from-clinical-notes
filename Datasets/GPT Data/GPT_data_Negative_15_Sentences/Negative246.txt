The patient is a 62-year-old male who presented with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 due to longstanding poorly controlled hypertension. The patient's medical history includes a 20-year history of hypertension, managed with multiple antihypertensive medications, but never optimally controlled. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was diagnosed 10 years ago and is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient has a significant smoking history of 30 pack-years and reports occasional alcohol use.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had a myocardial infarction three years ago, for which he underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient also has a history of dyslipidemia, for which he takes a statin.

The patient is now planning to have elective surgery for an elective inguinal hernia repair. Preoperatively, various laboratory tests were conducted, including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, liver function tests, and coagulation studies, which were all within normal limits. His creatinine clearance was 52 mL/min, consistent with his CKD stage 3. He does not have a history of acute renal failure.

In the postoperative course, the patient tolerated the surgical procedure well. He was closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of postoperative complications. The patient received appropriate postoperative pain management and was ambulating within a few hours after the surgery. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and received adequate wound care instructions.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain gradually subsided, and he experienced a gradual improvement in his ambulation. His incision site appeared clean and was healing well without signs of infection. The patient's overall recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on the third day post-surgery with appropriate discharge instructions.

During the postoperative period, the patient did not develop any major complications such as wound dehiscence, surgical site infection, or deep vein thrombosis. There were no signs of acute kidney injury, and his renal function remained stable. The patient was advised to continue his regular medications, including antihypertensive and hypoglycemic agents, and to follow up with his primary care physician for routine monitoring of his chronic conditions.

In conclusion, this 62-year-old male patient with CKD stage 3, poorly controlled hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and a smoking history presented for elective inguinal hernia repair. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and did not develop any major complications.
