His blood pressure is well-controlled on lisinopril 10 mg daily. He takes atorvastatin 20 mg daily for his hyperlipidemia, and metformin 1000 mg twice daily for his diabetes. His HbA1c is 7.2%.

The patient underwent a preoperative evaluation and was found to be in overall good health. He does not have any known drug allergies and denies any previous adverse reactions to anesthesia. He does smoke 10 cigarettes per day and has been doing so for the past 30 years. However, he has no plans to quit smoking at this time.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. Vital signs are all within normal limits. His heart sounds are regular without murmurs, and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no palpable masses or organomegaly.

Laboratory tests including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies were all within normal limits. His chest x-ray did not show any abnormalities, and his electrocardiogram was unremarkable.

During surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia without any complications. The procedure was completed successfully, and the hernia was repaired with mesh. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated without any issues in the operating room.

In the postoperative period, the patient's pain was managed with analgesics as needed. He ambulated on the day of surgery and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any nausea or vomiting. He did have some mild constipation, which was managed with stool softeners and increased fluid intake.

The patient's surgical site was monitored closely for signs of infection or dehiscence. There were no signs of wound infection, and the incision healed well without any complications.
