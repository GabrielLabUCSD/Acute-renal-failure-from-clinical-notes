Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough medical evaluation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies. His preoperative laboratory tests were within normal limits, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were also normal.

During the surgery, the kidney stone was successfully removed using minimally invasive techniques. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room postoperatively.
