The patient is a 60-year-old female planning to have surgery. She has a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis in both knees, and hyperlipidemia. Her hypertension is well-controlled with medication, and her last blood pressure reading was 128/78 mmHg. She takes metformin and glipizide for her diabetes, with her HbA1c levels consistently below 7%. Her lipid profile is also well-controlled on atorvastatin.

She mentions intermittent knee pain, which has progressively worsened over the years. X-rays of both knees confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy, analgesics, and joint injections, but her symptoms have persistently persisted. As a result, she has decided to proceed with total knee replacement surgery.

In terms of surgical risk factors, the patient is a non-smoker, denies excessive alcohol use, and has a body mass index (BMI) of 26.6 kg/m². She is compliant with her medications and has no known allergies to any anesthesia or surgical drugs. Preoperative labs show normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.87 mg/dL.

The procedure goes smoothly, and the patient is extubated without any issues. Postoperatively, she is started on a multimodal pain regimen including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and local anesthetic infiltration. Physical therapy is initiated the following day, and the patient is able to ambulate with assistance.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature ranging from 97.8°F to 98.6°F, heart rate in the 70s-80s, and blood pressure ranging from 120/70 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg. Her pain is well-controlled, and she reports no signs of wound infection. She progresses with physical therapy, and by day three, she is able to ambulate with minimal assistance.

During her postoperative course, the patient experiences no major complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound dehiscence, or surgical site infection. Her incision site shows appropriate healing, with no signs of redness, swelling, or drainage. The patient's renal function remains stable throughout her hospital stay, with no evidence of acute kidney injury.

Overall, the patient has a successful postoperative course with no major complications following her total knee replacement surgery. She is discharged home on postoperative day four with home healthcare services arranged for ongoing physical therapy and wound care. The patient is instructed to follow up with her orthopedic surgeon in two weeks for suture removal and further evaluation of her progress.
