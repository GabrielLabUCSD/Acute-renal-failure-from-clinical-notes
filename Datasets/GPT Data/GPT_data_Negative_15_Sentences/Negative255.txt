The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been on antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years, and his blood pressure has been well controlled. His dyslipidemia is managed with a statin, and his most recent lipid profile showed good control. His diabetes is controlled with oral antidiabetic medications, and he has a stable hemoglobin A1c level of 7%.

The patient has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He does not have any respiratory symptoms or history of chronic lung disease. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 28, indicating he is overweight. The patient is not currently physically active but states that he has no limitations in his daily activities. He does not have any known drug allergies.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient underwent routine laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, liver function tests, and renal function tests. All the results were within normal limits, except for a slight elevation in his liver enzymes, which is attributed to his dyslipidemia. His renal function tests showed no evidence of chronic kidney disease.

The patient was evaluated by the anesthesiology team, and no significant concerns were noted. He was classified as ASA Class II (mild systemic disease) due to his history of hypertension and diabetes. He was instructed to continue taking his regular antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the day of surgery with a sip of water.

The patient underwent surgery without any intraoperative complications. The procedure was successful, and the hernia was repaired using mesh. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He was started on oral analgesics for pain control and instructed on wound care. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet, ambulate, and void normally. His blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative course.

The patient was discharged home on the second postoperative day with appropriate discharge instructions. He was advised to continue taking his regular medications, including pain medications as needed, and to follow up with his primary care physician in 2 weeks. The patient was instructed to gradually resume physical activity and to avoid heavy lifting for the next 4-6 weeks.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient did not report any complications such as wound infection, hematoma, or seroma formation. He did not experience any adverse events related to anesthesia, such as nausea, vomiting, or respiratory distress. He followed up with his primary care physician as scheduled, and his wound was healing well without signs of infection or dehiscence. Overall, the patient had a successful surgical experience without any complications.
