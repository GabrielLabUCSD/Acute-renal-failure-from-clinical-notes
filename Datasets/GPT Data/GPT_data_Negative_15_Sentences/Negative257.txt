The patient is a 55-year-old female who has a past medical history significant for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril. She also has a history of mild osteoarthritis in her knees, managed conservatively with physical therapy. She is a non-smoker and has no known drug allergies.

The patient presents to the clinic for a preoperative evaluation as she is planning to have surgery for a total knee replacement due to worsening pain and functional limitation. Her knee pain has been gradually worsening over the past 3 years, and she has tried conservative measures without significant relief, including pain medications, physical therapy, and bracing. Her recent radiographs demonstrate severe osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing and bone spurs.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent a series of tests and assessments to ensure she is medically fit for surgery. Her blood pressure was well-controlled on her current antihypertensive medication. Laboratory workup, including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation profile, and urinalysis, all revealed normal results. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm.

In preparation for surgery, the patient was educated on the surgical process, expected postoperative course, and potential complications. She was advised to discontinue non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and blood-thinning medications prior to surgery. The patient was also given instructions for postoperative pain management, including a combination of opioid medications and non-pharmacological measures, such as icing and elevation.

The patient underwent successful total knee replacement surgery and had an uneventful intraoperative course. Postoperatively, she received physical therapy and mobilized with the assistance of a walker. She exhibited good pain control with the prescribed medications and tolerated a modified diet without any issues. Her surgical wound was clean, dry, and intact. She did not develop any signs of surgical site infection.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient was regularly monitored for complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pneumonia. Appropriate prophylactic measures were taken, including the use of compression stockings, early ambulation, and deep breathing exercises. She did not experience any respiratory distress or formation of blood clots.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3 and continued her physical therapy on an outpatient basis. At her follow-up appointments, she demonstrated steady improvement in knee range of motion and reduction in pain. Her surgical wound remained well-healed and without signs of infection. She was advised to continue her pain medication regimen and adhere to physical therapy instructions.

In summary, this 55-year-old female with a history of hypertension underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course, with no evidence of surgical site infection, DVT, or other complications. The patient demonstrated satisfactory pain control and functional recovery during follow-up visits.
