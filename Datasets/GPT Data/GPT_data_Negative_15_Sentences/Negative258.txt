His lab work, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and coagulation profile, was within normal limits. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram did not reveal any abnormalities.

Postoperatively, Patient X had an unremarkable course. He was closely monitored in the recovery room for vital signs, pain control, and surgical site assessment.
