Patient X is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. He takes atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia and metformin for his type 2 diabetes, which is also well-managed with a HbA1c of 6.5%.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy 10 years ago and has had no postoperative complications. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. The patient does not have any known drug allergies.

The patient's current medication list also includes aspirin 81 mg daily for the prevention of cardiovascular events. He has been taking this medication for the past 5 years without any complications. His blood pressure at the time of preoperative assessment was 130/80 mmHg, and his heart rate was 75 beats per minute.

Lab results showed a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's baseline kidney function is within normal limits. His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm without any abnormalities.

The patient is aware of the risks and benefits of the surgery and has given informed consent. He has been instructed to discontinue his aspirin one week prior to the surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding. The patient has been advised to continue taking his other medications, except for metformin, which will be held on the day of surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He was able to tolerate oral intake soon after surgery and had no issues with wound healing.

No complications were noted during the patient's hospital stay. He was discharged on postoperative day 2 with a prescription for acetaminophen for pain management. The patient was instructed to follow up in the surgeon's office in 2 weeks to assess wound healing and ensure a smooth recovery. Instructions for potential signs of infection or other complications were also provided.
