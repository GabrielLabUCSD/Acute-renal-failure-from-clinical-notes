The patient is a 57-year-old male who has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and obesity. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, placing him in the obese category. He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history and drinks alcohol occasionally.

The patient has been scheduled for surgery to remove a benign tumor in his left kidney. He has been experiencing intermittent left flank pain for the past six months, which prompted further investigation leading to the diagnosis. Kidney function tests including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were within normal limits. 

Preoperatively, the patient has been advised to stop smoking and drinking alcohol due to the increased risks and complications associated with these habits during and after surgery. He has been counseled about the importance of glycemic control to optimize wound healing and reduce the risk of surgical site infection.

During surgery, the patient underwent a laparoscopic left kidney tumor resection without any intraoperative complications. The surgery lasted two hours. The pathology report confirmed the tumor to be a benign angiomyolipoma.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced mild pain at the surgical site for which he was managed with non-opioid analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate early to prevent postoperative DVT and pulmonary complications. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was started on a clear liquid diet, which was advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.

The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. At the time of discharge, his pain was well controlled with oral analgesics, and he was instructed to continue taking them as needed. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the next two weeks. 

A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks after surgery to assess wound healing and review the final pathology report. The patient developed no complications postoperatively, and wound healing was satisfactory. The final pathology report confirmed the complete resection of the benign angiomyolipoma without any evidence of malignancy or invasion.

In summary, this 57-year-old male patient with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and obesity underwent a laparoscopic left kidney tumor resection for a benign angiomyolipoma. He had no intraoperative complications and had a smooth postoperative course. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day, and at the two-week follow-up, he showed no signs of complications with satisfactory wound healing.
