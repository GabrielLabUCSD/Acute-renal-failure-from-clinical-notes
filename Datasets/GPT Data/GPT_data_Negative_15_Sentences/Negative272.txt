The patient is a 60-year-old female who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. Her medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, all of which are well-controlled with medication. She does not have any significant allergies. 

Her surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago and an appendectomy performed 20 years ago. She tolerated both procedures well and had an uneventful postoperative course. 

Currently, she is on several medications including lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. She has been compliant with her medications and there have been no recent changes to her medication regimen. 

Cardiac evaluation including an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram was completed in preparation for surgery, which revealed no significant abnormalities. Her exercise tolerance is good and she denies any symptoms of angina or shortness of breath. 

Lab work performed prior to surgery showed a fasting blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%, and a lipid panel within normal limits. Her renal function is normal with a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. 

During the preoperative assessment, the anesthesiologist determined that the patient is an appropriate candidate for surgery and will receive general anesthesia. 

Postoperatively, the patient will be monitored closely for any signs of infection, bleeding, or postoperative pain. She will be started on a clear liquid diet and advanced as tolerated. Pain control will be managed with a combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics. 

The patient is expected to have a normal postoperative course and should be able to ambulate and perform activities of daily living within a few days. She will be discharged home once her pain is adequately controlled and she is able to tolerate a regular diet. 

Complications that may occur postoperatively include infection, hematoma, wound dehiscence, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient will be advised to watch for any signs of infection such as increased redness, warmth, or drainage at the surgical site. She will also be educated on measures to prevent deep vein thrombosis, such as early ambulation and leg exercises. 

It is important for the patient to follow up with her primary care physician after surgery to ensure proper wound healing and to address any postoperative concerns. Overall, based on her medical history and preoperative evaluation, the patient is considered to be at low risk for complications and is expected to have a successful outcome from the surgery.
