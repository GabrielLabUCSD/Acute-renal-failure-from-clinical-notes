The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia who is planned for surgery. He has been on antihypertensive medication for the last 10 years, using a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker. His blood pressure has been well controlled on this regimen, with the most recent reading of 130/80 mmHg.

His diabetes mellitus type 2 has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents, specifically metformin and a sulfonylurea. His most recent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control. He has never required insulin therapy.

The patient's hyperlipidemia has been treated with a statin for the last 5 years. His most recent lipid panel showed a total cholesterol level of 180 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of 100 mg/dL.

He has a past surgical history of cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course.

His social history is significant for smoking for 20 years, although he quit smoking 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally but does not have a history of substance abuse.

His family history is significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus in both parents. No history of early cardiovascular disease or malignancies have been reported.

The patient's preoperative evaluation revealed normal renal function, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. He does not have any known allergies or adverse reactions to medications.

Postoperatively, the patient tolerated the surgical procedure well and recovered without any major complications. He received appropriate prophylactic antibiotic therapy as per surgical guidelines and had no evidence of surgical site infection or wound-related complications.

Although the patient was at risk for postoperative respiratory complications due to his smoking history, he did not develop any such complications. Postoperative pain management was achieved with opioid analgesics for the initial few days, followed by a transition to non-opioid analgesics.

The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were monitored closely in the postoperative period, and they remained within target ranges. His antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications were resumed on the first postoperative day.

No postoperative complications related to his cardiovascular or metabolic conditions were observed. The patient was mobilized early, received physical therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis, and was discharged home in a stable condition on postoperative day 4.

Considering the patient's medical history and the uneventful postoperative course, he did not experience any significant complications, including acute renal failure, following his recent surgery.
