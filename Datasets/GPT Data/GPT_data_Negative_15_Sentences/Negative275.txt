They have a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well-controlled with medication. Furthermore, the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, managed with diet and exercise alone. 

Patient X's surgical risk assessment indicates that they are otherwise fit for surgery, with no history of cardiac or pulmonary complications. Preoperative lab tests including complete blood count, coagulation studies, liver function tests, and renal function tests were all within normal limits. Their renal function was estimated at a glomerular filtration rate of 78 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicative of normal kidney function. 

Patient X does not have a history of acute or chronic kidney disease and has not experienced any previous episodes of acute renal failure. They have not required dialysis or any other renal replacement therapy.

Patient X's renal function remained within normal limits in the postoperative period, with no significant changes or deterioration. Their urine output and urinary function were also unremarkable. 

Additionally, the patient did not develop any signs or symptoms of kidney injury, such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, or impaired renal function. 

Patient X was discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day and was scheduled for a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess their overall recovery and any potential long-term complications. 

In summary, Patient X is a 58-year-old individual with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, all of which are well-controlled. They are preparing for surgery and do not have a history of acute or chronic kidney disease or acute renal failure. 

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery without any complications, including acute renal failure. Their renal function remained normal, and they experienced no significant changes or deterioration in kidney function.
