The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and is currently on a combination of antihypertensive medications including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. His blood pressure has been well controlled with this regimen. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 5 years ago and is on atorvastatin to manage his cholesterol levels. The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago and is currently being treated with metformin. He has good glycemic control with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient has a history of smoking 1 pack per day for 20 years. He quit smoking 10 years ago. He denies any history of lung disease or respiratory symptoms. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, indicating obesity. He reports occasional knee pain and stiffness but denies any history of joint surgery. X-ray of the knees showed mild degenerative changes.

The patient's preoperative evaluation includes a comprehensive metabolic panel, which shows normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. All other electrolytes, liver function tests, and blood counts are within normal limits. The patient also underwent a cardiac evaluation, including an electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac stress test, which revealed no significant abnormalities.

Following the surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He required pain management with opioids for the first 24 hours post-surgery but transitioned to oral analgesics thereafter. The patient mobilized well and had no signs of infection or wound complications. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively and received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. His blood glucose levels remained stable throughout the postoperative period, and his diabetes medications were continued. The patient was encouraged to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy lifestyle to optimize his recovery.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any complications postoperatively. His wound healed well, and he had no evidence of infection or dehiscence. His pain was adequately controlled, and he did not require any additional interventions or procedures. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4 and was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician in 2 weeks for routine postoperative evaluation.
