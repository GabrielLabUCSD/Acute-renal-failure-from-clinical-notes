His kidney function, as assessed by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m².

Surgery is planned for the patient to address a symptomatic gallstone. The patient has been advised regarding the procedure and has provided informed consent. The surgical team anticipates a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

In the postoperative course, the patient initially experienced mild pain and fatigue, which gradually improved over the following days. He was started on a clear liquid diet the day after surgery and tolerated it well. The surgical wound was clean and dry, with no signs of infection or dehiscence.
