Patient X is a 45-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. He presents to the surgical clinic for evaluation and consultation regarding his decision to undergo surgery for an elective inguinal hernia repair. Patient X reports a history of recurrent episodes of inguinal hernia and complains of mild pain and discomfort in the groin area. He has been experiencing these symptoms intermittently for the past six months, and they have progressively worsened in severity.

During the preoperative evaluation, Patient X underwent a comprehensive workup, which included routine blood tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), and a chest X-ray. His blood work revealed slightly elevated blood glucose levels, consistent with his known history of uncontrolled diabetes. His echocardiogram showed no signs of significant cardiac disease, and his pulmonary function tests were within normal limits.

Patient X's surgery was scheduled following optimization of his blood glucose levels through medication adjustments and lifestyle modifications. He was admitted the day before the procedure for preoperative fasting and to receive perioperative antibiotics.

The hernia repair surgery was performed under general anesthesia. The procedure went smoothly, without any intraoperative complications. The surgeon repaired the hernia using a laparoscopic technique, placing a mesh to reinforce the weakened abdominal wall. Postoperatively, Patient X was monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of bleeding, infection, or respiratory distress. He was given pain medications and instructed on proper wound care.

During his hospital stay, Patient X had an uneventful recovery. His vital signs remained stable, and he experienced minimal pain, which was well-controlled with oral pain medications. Patient X was able to ambulate and resume a regular diet without any issues. His blood glucose levels were monitored closely and remained within an acceptable range. There were no signs of wound infection or dehiscence.

Patient X was discharged home on the second postoperative day with appropriate pain medications and instructions for wound care. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for one week after discharge to assess the healing of the surgical site and review blood glucose control.

In conclusion, Patient X underwent an elective inguinal hernia repair with a laparoscopic technique. His postoperative course was unremarkable, without any complications. He had a smooth recovery and showed no signs of infection, bleeding, or respiratory distress. Patient X will continue to be monitored closely in the postoperative period to ensure proper wound healing and glycemic control.
