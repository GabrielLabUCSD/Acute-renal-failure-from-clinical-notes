The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with symptoms of severe osteoarthritis in both knees, causing chronic pain and limited mobility. He has previously tried conservative management including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with minimal relief.

Upon examination, the patient has significant joint deformity, range of motion restrictions, and difficulty walking. X-rays confirm advanced degenerative changes in both knees. Due to the severity of symptoms, surgical intervention is recommended.

Preoperative workup reveals well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram show no significant cardiac abnormalities. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate normal lung function. Laboratory tests indicate no contraindications to surgery.

The patient is scheduled to undergo bilateral total knee replacement surgery (TKR). The procedure involves removing the damaged joint surfaces and replacing them with prosthetic components. The surgery is expected to alleviate pain, improve joint function, and enhance the patient's overall quality of life.

Postoperatively, the patient receives intravenous antibiotics to prevent infection. Physical therapy begins on the first day after surgery, focusing on knee mobilization, strengthening exercises, and gait training. Pain is managed with a combination of opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

The patient's postoperative course is generally uneventful. He demonstrates good pain control and compliance with physical therapy. Wound healing progresses without signs of infection. He achieves gradual improvement in knee flexion and extension. Weight-bearing activities are gradually introduced, and the patient is able to walk independently with the assistance of a walker within a week.

At the two-week follow-up appointment, the patient reports significant pain reduction and improved knee function. He continues physical therapy and begins outpatient rehabilitation. Range of motion significantly improves, and the patient is able to engage in activities of daily living with minimal discomfort.

Throughout the postoperative period, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remain stable, and his pre-existing medical conditions are well-managed.

Overall, the patient's postoperative recovery has been satisfactory. The TKR surgery has provided him with significant pain relief and improved mobility, enabling him to resume normal daily activities.
