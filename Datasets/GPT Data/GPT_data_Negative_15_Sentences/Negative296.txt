The patient is a 63-year-old male presenting to the hospital for surgical intervention. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia. His blood pressure has been well-controlled on Lisinopril 20 mg daily, and his glucose levels are managed with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with placement of two drug-eluting stents in his right coronary artery.

The patient's surgical procedure is unrelated to his cardiac condition. He is scheduled for elective cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. He has been experiencing intermittent right upper quadrant pain, with several episodes of biliary colic over the past six months. Imaging studies revealed multiple gallstones, with no evidence of acute cholecystitis.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a preoperative evaluation, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and electrocardiogram. The laboratory results were within normal limits. An echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular systolic function, with no significant valvular abnormalities.

The patient was admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery and received prophylactic antibiotics. The cholecystectomy was performed laparoscopically without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for vital signs, pain control, and potential complications. He experienced mild postoperative pain, which was managed with intravenous opioids. Oral intake was gradually resumed, starting with clear liquids and advancing to a regular diet as tolerated. Bowel function returned within 24 hours, with the passage of flatus.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not develop any signs of surgical site infection or wound complications. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and his anti-diabetic medications were adjusted accordingly, ensuring optimal glycemic control. The patient was mobilized on the first postoperative day and encouraged to engage in deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia.

The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day in stable condition. He was given written instructions for wound care, pain management, and diet modifications. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks after surgery to assess his progress and remove any remaining sutures.

In conclusion, this 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. His postoperative course was unremarkable, without any complications. The patient was discharged in stable condition, and appropriate follow-up was arranged.
