The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a gallbladder removal due to chronic cholecystitis. He was diagnosed with this condition two years ago and has been experiencing recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The decision was made to proceed with surgery to alleviate his symptoms and prevent further complications.

His medical history is significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He has been taking lisinopril 10 mg daily for the past five years. Additionally, he has a history of tobacco use, smoking half a pack per day for the past 20 years. He denies any other chronic medical conditions and reports generally good health overall.

His preoperative workup revealed normal liver function tests and an ultrasound confirmed the presence of gallstones. His cardiopulmonary evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and spirometry, were within normal limits. There were no signs of any other significant comorbidities or contraindications to surgery.

The patient underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, there were no complications noted, and the surgery was successfully completed. Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered prior to incision and discontinued within 24 hours.

Postoperatively, the patient initially had mild pain at the incision sites, which was managed with oral analgesics. He was able to tolerate a normal diet and there were no signs of malabsorption or biliary leakage. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not require any supplementary oxygen.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day two with instructions to gradually increase his physical activity and avoid heavy lifting for the next week. He was prescribed a short course of oral antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a wound check and to discuss any concerns or questions.

During the postoperative course, the patient did not experience any significant complications. He reported a gradual improvement in pain and overall well-being. There were no signs of wound infection or other surgical site-related issues. The patient's recovery progressed as expected and he was able to resume his normal daily activities without limitations by three weeks postoperatively.

In summary, the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis without any perioperative complications. His postoperative course was unremarkable, and he recovered well without any complications. The surgery successfully resolved his symptoms, and he remains under routine surveillance for long-term management of gallstones.
