The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. His hyperlipidemia is managed with a statin medication. His diabetes is also well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Laboratory tests were within normal limits, with a fasting blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%, and total cholesterol of 190 mg/dL.

The patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia, and the procedure was uneventful. In the postoperative period, the patient experienced mild pain at the incision site, which was effectively managed with opioid analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate on the day after surgery to promote early recovery and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

During the hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, with no episodes of hypotension or tachycardia. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and his diabetes management was continued with oral medications. The patient was started on deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.

The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, with steady improvement in pain control and gradual resolution of swelling at the incision site. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and passed urine without any difficulties. The surgical wound was inspected daily for signs of infection, but no signs or symptoms were observed.

The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day with instructions for activity restriction and wound care. He was advised to continue his regular medications and follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks. Before discharge, the patient received education on signs and symptoms of infection and potential complications that should prompt immediate medical attention.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course without any major complications. He tolerated the surgery well and was discharged in stable condition. Close follow-up was planned to ensure complete recovery and appropriate management of his underlying medical conditions.
