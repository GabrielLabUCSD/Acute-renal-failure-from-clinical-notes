The patient is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He takes metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin for his conditions. The patient has a history of smoking for 20 years but quit five years ago. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

On physical examination, the patient is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30. His blood pressure is well-controlled at 130/80 mmHg, and his heart rate is regular at 80 beats per minute. His lung exam is clear, and his heart sounds are normal with no murmurs or extra sounds.

Laboratory values reveal a hemoglobin A1c level of 7.5%, indicating fair glycemic control. His fasting lipid panel shows total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 120 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 150 mg/dL. His renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient discusses his surgical plan with the surgical team and obtains a medical clearance for surgery. The anesthesiologist recommends a preoperative assessment due to the patient's diabetes and hypertension. The patient undergoes the surgery under general anesthesia.

Postoperatively, the patient is stable and recovers in the surgical ICU. He is monitored closely for signs of infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is started on intravenous fluids and his blood glucose is monitored closely. The surgical wound is inspected for any signs of infection, and appropriate wound care is provided.

During the postoperative course, the patient's blood glucose levels are well-controlled, and he does not develop any signs of infection or thromboembolic events. The surgical wound appears to be healing well, with no signs of dehiscence or necrosis. The patient experiences some postoperative pain, which is adequately managed with analgesics.

The patient is discharged from the hospital on postoperative day three. He is given oral pain medications and instructions for wound care. He is advised to follow up with the surgeon in two weeks for a wound check. The patient is also referred to a diabetes educator to optimize his glycemic control.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no major complications. His well-controlled hypertension and diabetes, along with appropriate perioperative management, likely contributed to his favorable outcome.
