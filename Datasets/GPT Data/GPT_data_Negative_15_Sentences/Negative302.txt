The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. His blood pressure is well controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. His diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and his last HbA1c was within target range. His lipid panel is stable on atorvastatin 20mg daily. He has a history of a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. He has been asymptomatic since then and is on aspirin and clopidogrel for secondary prevention.

The patient has no known allergies and does not smoke. He has a body mass index of 27, indicating him as overweight. He reports occasional exertional dyspnea, likely due to his reduced exercise tolerance. On physical examination, he has a regular heart rate and rhythm without murmurs, jugular venous distention, or edema.

Preoperatively, the patient had a thorough evaluation, including laboratory tests, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray, which were all within normal limits. His renal function is stable, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and he has a calculated glomerular filtration rate of 65 ml/min/1.73mÂ². He was also seen by a cardiologist who deemed him acceptable for surgery without further cardiac testing.

The patient received preoperative counseling regarding the surgical procedure, risks, and benefits. He also had a discussion with the anesthesiologist regarding anesthesia options, and it was decided that general anesthesia would be the most appropriate in this case.

Following surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. He received appropriate pain management and did not develop any surgical site infections. His vital signs remained stable, and his blood glucose levels were well controlled. He ambulated early and had no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

During his hospital stay, the patient was closely monitored for any signs of complications, particularly his renal function. His urine output remained adequate, and his serum creatinine levels did not increase. He did not develop urinary retention or any other urological complications.

In summary, the patient, a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, underwent surgery without complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and there were no signs of acute renal failure or any other major complications. He was discharged home in stable condition and is scheduled for a follow-up visit with his primary care physician in two weeks.
