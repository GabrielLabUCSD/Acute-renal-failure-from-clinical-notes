The patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with chronic kidney disease and hypertension. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and dyslipidemia. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics for the past 10 years. He also takes oral hypoglycemic agents and statins for his diabetes and dyslipidemia, respectively.

His renal function has been stable with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 ml/min/1.73m². He has been regularly monitored by a nephrologist and his renal function has not significantly declined over the past six months. His blood pressure is well controlled, with readings consistently less than 130/80 mmHg. The patient has never had any episodes of acute renal failure.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure for a non-malignant condition. He has been assessed by a multidisciplinary team and deemed fit for surgery. Preoperative investigations, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and renal function tests, were all within normal limits. His eGFR remained stable at 40 ml/min/1.73m².

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the surgical intensive care unit. He received appropriate perioperative intravenous fluid management and analgesia. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels were maintained within target ranges. The patient's renal function remained stable with no significant changes observed postoperatively.

During his hospital stay, the patient did not experience any complications related to the surgery. There were no signs of infection, wound complications, or postoperative bleeding. His pain was well controlled with oral analgesics. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his recovery.

Upon discharge, the patient was advised to continue with his regular medication regimen, including antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, and statins. He was also provided with appropriate postoperative wound care instructions. An outpatient follow-up appointment was scheduled in two weeks to assess the patient's recovery.

In conclusion, this 60-year-old male patient with chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia underwent surgery for a non-malignant condition without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and his renal function remained stable. The patient was discharged home with appropriate medication and wound care instructions and scheduled for follow-up to monitor his recovery.
