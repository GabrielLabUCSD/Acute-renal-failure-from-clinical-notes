The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. The patient has been taking antihypertensive medications, statins, and oral hypoglycemic agents to manage his conditions.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient has a history of smoking for 30 years, with a 10-pack-year smoking history. He quit smoking five years ago. The patient also has a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 65.

The patient presented to the hospital with complaints of worsening shortness of breath on exertion and chest pain. Upon evaluation, he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery.

Considering the severity of his coronary artery disease, the patient is now scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Prior to the surgery, his medications were optimized, and he received preoperative counseling and education on the procedure.

The patient underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The surgical team performed a triple-vessel coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein grafts to the other affected vessels.

Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit. He was closely monitored for hemodynamic stability, pain control, and respiratory status. He received appropriate analgesics, anticoagulation therapy, and respiratory support as needed.

During the immediate postoperative course, the patient had an uneventful recovery and was weaned off the ventilator within 12 hours. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and began physical therapy on the second day following the surgery.

The patient's postoperative course was mainly uncomplicated. However, he was noted to have mild surgical site infection at the incision site, which was managed with wound care and antibiotics. He did not develop any other major complications such as postoperative bleeding, myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5 with appropriate discharge instructions, including wound care and medication management. He had a follow-up appointment scheduled in two weeks to assess his progress and monitor his cardiac function.

In summary, this 60-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes underwent a triple-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting surgery due to severe coronary artery disease. His postoperative course was mainly uneventful, with the exception of a mild surgical site infection that was successfully treated. The patient was discharged home with ongoing follow-up care to ensure his continued recovery.
