During the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored in the hospital for pain control, wound healing, and mobility. Physical therapy was initiated to aid in rehabilitation and early mobilization. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period.

He received prophylactic antibiotics as per the hospital's protocol to prevent surgical site infections. There were no signs of wound infection or other surgical complications noted during the hospital stay.

The patient's recovery was monitored closely on an outpatient basis. With regular follow-up appointments, the orthopedic surgeon assessed the patient's incision site and range of motion. The patient experienced mild pain and swelling, which gradually improved with time and physical therapy.

At his most recent follow-up appointment one month post-surgery, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and mobility. His knee range of motion had significantly increased, and he was able to perform daily activities with minimal discomfort.
