The patient was admitted to the hospital for elective surgery to repair an inguinal hernia. Preoperative lab work showed a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, within normal limits. The patient had no previous history of acute renal failure.

During surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and the procedure was successful without any complications. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. He did not require any blood transfusions and there were no intraoperative complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was started on acetaminophen and an opioid for pain control. He received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. The patient was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to promote early recovery.

On postoperative day 1, the patient experienced mild postoperative pain and was able to tolerate a regular diet. His urinary output remained within normal limits. He was managed with oral pain medications and there were no signs of infection or wound complications.

The patient was seen by physical therapy for rehabilitation and was able to ambulate independently by postoperative day 2. His surgical incision appeared well-healed without any signs of infection or dehiscence.

By postoperative day 4, the patient's pain improved significantly and he no longer required opioids for pain control. He was discharged home with postoperative instructions for wound care, activity restrictions, and medication management.

During the follow-up visit at 2 weeks, the patient reported continued improvement in pain and mobility. His surgical incision demonstrated complete healing without any signs of infection or complications.

Overall, this patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course after undergoing inguinal hernia repair surgery. He achieved satisfactory pain control, tolerated a regular diet, and regained mobility relatively quickly. The surgical incision healed well without any signs of infection or other complications. The patient will continue to be monitored in primary care for his ongoing medical conditions.
