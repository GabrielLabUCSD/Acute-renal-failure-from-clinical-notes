The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has been on medications for both conditions and his blood pressure and blood sugar levels have been well controlled. The patient also has a history of hyperlipidemia and has been taking statins for several years.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uneventful and the patient had a smooth postoperative course without any complications.

The patient also has a history of osteoarthritis affecting his right knee. He has been managing the symptoms with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy, but his knee pain has been progressively worsening. Due to the severity of his symptoms and impairments in daily activities, the patient has decided to undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery.

Prior to the surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation which included blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a chest x-ray. All the results were within normal limits, indicating that the patient was a suitable candidate for surgery.

The patient was admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery and received general anesthesia. The TKA procedure was performed without any complications. The surgeon noted severe degenerative changes in the patient's knee joint and successfully replaced it with a prosthetic implant.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient was carefully monitored for any signs of infection, deep vein thrombosis, or excessive bleeding. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to prevent these complications. The patient was also initiated on a standardized postoperative pain management protocol, which included a combination of oral and intravenous analgesic medications.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he started physical therapy the day after surgery. He gradually regained mobility and was able to bear weight on his operated knee. The wound was healing well, and there were no signs of infection or other complications.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on the third day after surgery with appropriate instructions for home care and rehabilitation. He was advised to continue physical therapy on an outpatient basis and to follow up with his primary care physician for routine postoperative assessments.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, and he did not experience any complications such as infection, excessive bleeding, or deep vein thrombosis. However, the patient did develop acute renal failure postoperatively, which required close monitoring and appropriate intervention by the medical team.
