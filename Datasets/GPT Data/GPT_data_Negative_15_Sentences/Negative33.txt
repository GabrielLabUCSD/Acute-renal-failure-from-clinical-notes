The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's blood pressure is well controlled on Lisinopril 10 mg daily, and his cholesterol levels are managed with Atorvastatin 20 mg daily. He monitors his blood glucose levels at home and maintains glycemic control with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily.

Furthermore, the patient had a previous surgery for appendectomy without any complications reported. He does not have a history of anesthesia-related complications or adverse reactions to medications. The patient denies any known drug allergies.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's physical examination revealed a reducible hernia in the inguinal region. His vital signs were stable, and his lungs were clear on auscultation. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function. The patient's preoperative chest X-ray and EKG were unremarkable.

The surgical team discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient, including the possibility of infection, bleeding, and recurrence of the hernia. The patient provided informed consent and agreed to proceed with the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for any signs of complications. He received adequate pain control with opioids and reported minimal discomfort. The incision site appeared clean and well-approximated, without any signs of infection. The patient ambulated well and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any gastrointestinal issues.

Daily checks of the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, were within normal limits. His fluid intake and output were monitored closely to prevent dehydration and maintain appropriate renal perfusion.

During his hospital stay, the patient did not develop any immediate postoperative complications. His healing progressed well, and he was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with appropriate instructions for wound care and activity restrictions.

The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a postoperative evaluation. No complications such as wound infection, hernia recurrence, or surgical-site hematoma were reported during the follow-up visit.

In summary, the patient, a middle-aged male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, successfully underwent hernia repair surgery without any acute renal failure as a complication. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he had a good recovery without any significant issues.
