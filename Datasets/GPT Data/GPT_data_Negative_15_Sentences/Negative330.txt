Mr. Smith is a 45-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a hernia repair under general anesthesia. He has been managing his hypertension with regular antihypertensive medication, and his diabetes is well-controlled with diet and exercise.

Mr. Smith's preoperative labs are within normal limits, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. His renal function is also within normal range. Chest x-ray and electrocardiogram are unremarkable, confirming his overall good health status.

During the surgery, the surgical team had no complications and successfully repaired Mr. Smith's hernia. He tolerated the procedure well without any evidence of surgical site infection or adverse reaction to anesthesia.

Postoperatively, Mr. Smith was kept on a regular diet and encouraged to ambulate as tolerated. He received appropriate pain management with oral analgesics, and his postoperative pain was well-controlled. He experienced the expected postoperative discomfort, which gradually reduced over the next few days.

Mr. Smith's vital signs remained stable during his hospital stay, with no signs of fever or postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence, hematoma, or seroma formation. He maintained his normal urinary output, and there were no signs of urinary tract infection or other renal complications.

Following his surgery, Mr. Smith was discharged home on the third postoperative day with oral pain medication and clear instructions for wound care and activity restrictions. He was advised to continue his regular antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications as before.

During his follow-up appointment, Mr. Smith reported an overall improvement in his pain levels and stated that he was able to resume his daily activities without significant limitations. His surgical incision appeared to be healing well without signs of infection or wound complications.

While Mr. Smith's postoperative course was generally uneventful, he did experience a minor bout of constipation as a side effect of the pain medication. This was managed successfully with dietary modifications, increased fluid intake, and the use of mild laxatives.

In summary, Mr. Smith, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes, underwent uneventful elective hernia repair surgery. His postoperative course was favorable with well-controlled pain and no evidence of surgical site infection or wound complications. The only notable postoperative issue was a transient episode of constipation, which was effectively managed. His renal function remained stable throughout, and there were no signs of acute renal failure or other renal complications.
