The patient, a 45-year-old male, has a significant medical history leading up to his planned surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on antihypertensive medications such as lisinopril and amlodipine for the past five years. His lipid profile has been managed with atorvastatin for the past three years.

For his diabetes, the patient has been taking metformin and glipizide to control his blood sugar levels for the past ten years. He also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient is a former smoker with a 10-pack year smoking history. He quit smoking five years ago. He reports occasional alcohol consumption, but denies any illicit drug use or recent travel. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The planned surgery is an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. Preoperative investigations, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. The patient received appropriate perioperative counseling and education, including preoperative fasting and restrictive measures.

Following the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was started on postoperative analgesia with oral acetaminophen and scheduled non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulate without assistance the day after surgery.

During his hospital stay, the patient did not experience any complications such as wound infections, urinary tract infections, or pulmonary complications. The surgical wound was healing well without signs of infection or dehiscence. His vital signs remained stable, with no evidence of fever or tachycardia.

There were no notable changes in the patient's renal function during the postoperative period. Serum creatinine levels remained within his baseline range, suggesting that there was no acute renal failure following the surgery.

In summary, the patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. He had no complications during his postoperative course, and his renal function remained unaffected. The patient's overall recovery was satisfactory, and he was discharged in stable condition with appropriate postoperative instructions and follow-up.
