The patient is a 54-year-old male who presented with chronic lower back pain and was diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation. He has a history of smoking for 30 years and has a BMI of 32, indicating obesity. The patient has tried conservative treatments such as physical therapy and pain medications, which provided temporary relief but didn't resolve the symptoms. After extensive discussion and consideration of various treatment options, the patient has decided to undergo surgery for his lumbar disc herniation.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 bpm. The patient's laboratory results were within normal limits, except for slightly elevated cholesterol levels. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities. The patient also completed a comprehensive preoperative physical exam, which showed tenderness in the lower back but no neurological deficits.

The patient underwent a microdiscectomy, which involved removing the herniated disc to relieve pressure on the nerves. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and lasted approximately 90 minutes. Intraoperative findings confirmed the presence of a significant disc herniation at the L4-L5 level. The surgical team successfully removed the herniated portion of the disc and observed immediate decompression of the affected nerve root.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the recovery room for a few hours and then transferred to the surgical ward. He experienced moderate incisional pain, which was managed with oral analgesics. The patient was encouraged to mobilize as tolerated and was provided with instructions for incision care and back strengthening exercises. He was discharged home on the third postoperative day with appropriate pain medications and strict activity restrictions.

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reported a significant improvement in his back pain. The incision site appeared clean and well-healed. The patient had no signs of infection or wound complications. The surgical team discussed the importance of adhering to activity restrictions and gradually increasing activity levels over time. The patient was advised to attend physical therapy sessions to optimize his recovery and avoid future complications.

In summary, the patient underwent a microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation. The surgery was successful, resulting in immediate decompression of the affected nerve root. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications or signs of infection. He experienced moderate incisional pain but achieved a significant improvement in his back pain. The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day and will continue physical therapy to aid in his recovery and prevent the recurrence of symptoms.
