The patient is a 52-year-old male who presented with chronic knee pain due to bilateral osteoarthritis. His pain has progressively worsened, and conservative treatment measures including physical therapy, analgesics, and intra-articular injections have failed to provide long-term relief. After careful consideration, the patient has decided to undergo bilateral total knee replacement surgery.

His medical history is significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with an angiotensin receptor blocker. He has no history of cardiovascular disease or any other significant comorbidities. The patient does not smoke and has a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range.

Preoperative evaluations, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray, were performed and revealed no abnormalities. The patient was deemed suitable for surgery and given appropriate preoperative instructions, including medication management and fasting guidelines.

The patient underwent bilateral total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. The procedures were uneventful, with no intraoperative complications reported. The patient received prophylactic antibiotics and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis perioperatively.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of complications, such as bleeding, infection, or cardiovascular instability. He was then transferred to the orthopedic ward where he continued to receive pain management, physical therapy, and wound care.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. He reported well-controlled pain and achieved satisfactory postoperative mobility with the assistance of a physical therapist. As planned, the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with appropriate pain medications and instructions for home care.

During the subsequent follow-up visits at two weeks and six weeks post-surgery, the patient demonstrated progressive improvement in knee function and reported a significant reduction in pain. The surgical incisions were clean and showed no signs of infection. The patient adhered to prescribed physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises, contributing to his successful recovery.

No major postoperative complications were noted, such as deep vein thrombosis, wound infection, or wound dehiscence. The patient did not experience any cardiovascular events, respiratory complications, or neurological sequelae.

In conclusion, the patient successfully underwent bilateral total knee replacement surgery for chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he achieved excellent pain relief and improved knee function with appropriate postoperative care. No complications were noted during the recovery period.
