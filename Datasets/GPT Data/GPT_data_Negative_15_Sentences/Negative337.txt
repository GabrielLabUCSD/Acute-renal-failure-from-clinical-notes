The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. He is planning to have surgery, but the exact type of surgery is yet to be determined. The patient has a previous surgical history of a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure five years ago. He also experienced a myocardial infarction two years ago, which was managed conservatively and did not require further intervention.

In terms of comorbidities, the patient has a long-standing history of smoking, consuming one pack per day for the past 40 years. He is currently on aspirin therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. The patient denies any history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, or any other significant medical conditions.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. His physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities except for a heaving apex beat and bilateral basal lung crepitations, which were most likely due to his previous CABG surgery.

Laboratory investigations showed a normal complete blood count and electrolyte panel. The patient's renal function, as determined by the serum creatinine level, was within the normal range, with a value of 0.9 mg/dL. However, it is worth noting that he has a calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating mild renal insufficiency.

The patient received optimized medical management for his hypertension and continued on his aspirin therapy up until the day of surgery. He was adequately preoperatively hydrated and received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis perioperatively.

The patient had an uneventful intraoperative course, with no complications reported during the surgery. Postoperatively, he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours. He was extubated within six hours of surgery and demonstrated stable vital signs. Chest X-ray performed postoperatively showed clear lung fields and no evidence of atelectasis or effusion.

The patient's pain was adequately managed with intravenous analgesics and transitioned to oral pain medications as tolerated. Early mobilization measures were implemented to prevent postoperative complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and atelectasis.

During his hospital stay, the patient did not experience any complications, such as wound infection, respiratory distress, or cardiovascular events. His renal function remained stable, with no significant changes in his creatinine levels. Close monitoring of his blood pressure was continued, and he was discharged on his antihypertensive medications.

In conclusion, this patient, who has a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, underwent surgery without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. His renal function remained stable, and he was discharged in a satisfactory condition.
