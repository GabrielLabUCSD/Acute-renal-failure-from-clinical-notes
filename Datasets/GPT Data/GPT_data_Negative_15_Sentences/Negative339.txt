The patient is a 45-year-old male who has been experiencing chronic back pain for the past five years. He has previously tried conservative treatments such as physical therapy and medications, but they provided only minimal relief. As a result, it has been recommended that he undergo surgery to address the underlying cause of his pain.

The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both of which are well-controlled with medication. He is a non-smoker and does not have any known drug allergies. Additionally, he does not take any over-the-counter medications or supplements regularly.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a series of tests, including bloodwork, electrocardiogram, and imaging studies, which revealed no significant abnormalities. He was cleared for surgery by both his primary care physician and the anesthesiologist.

The surgical procedure planned for the patient is a lumbar discectomy, which aims to remove the herniated disc that is causing his back pain. The surgeon explained the risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient, and he provided informed consent.

Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the surgical unit and closely monitored for any complications. He was prescribed pain medications to manage postoperative pain and given instructions to limit physical activity for the first few weeks. Physical therapy was recommended to help with a smooth recovery.

The patient's postoperative course was largely unremarkable, with good pain control achieved through the prescribed medications. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulate independently without any significant difficulty. The surgical wound showed no signs of infection and was healing well.

During his hospital stay, the patient received education about pain management, wound care, and signs and symptoms of potential complications. He was provided with contact information to reach out to his healthcare provider if he experienced any concerns or worsening symptoms.

The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day with prescriptions for pain medications and a referral for outpatient physical therapy. He was advised to gradually increase his activity level and follow up with his surgeon for a postoperative check-up in two weeks.

At his follow-up appointment, the patient reported a significant improvement in his back pain and overall function. The surgical wound had fully healed, and the patient did not experience any complications such as wound infection or excessive bleeding. The surgeon was pleased with his progress and cleared him to return to regular activities gradually.

In conclusion, the patient underwent a lumbar discectomy for chronic back pain. His postoperative course was uneventful with good pain control, and he did not develop any complications. The surgery successfully alleviated his back pain, and the patient's overall prognosis is favorable.
