The patient, a 60-year-old male, has a significant medical history. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and a previous myocardial infarction (MI) two years ago. He takes metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin for his medical conditions.

Recently, he developed severe joint pain in his right knee due to osteoarthritis, and conservative treatment measures have failed. Therefore, he is planning to undergo total knee replacement surgery to alleviate his symptoms and improve his mobility.

In terms of his surgical risk, he had a cardiac evaluation, including an echocardiogram, which showed preserved left ventricular function and no significant valvular abnormalities. His exercise stress test was negative for ischemic changes. Therefore, he was cleared for the surgery without the need for further cardiac intervention.

On the day of surgery, he was brought to the operating room and received general anesthesia. The procedure was performed without any intraoperative complications. The surgeon removed the damaged portion of the knee joint and replaced it with an artificial joint. The patient was closely monitored and received appropriate pain management during and after the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where his vital signs were stable. He was encouraged to ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pneumonia. He was also started on a regimen of postoperative pain management, including opioids initially, which were then transitioned to non-opioid analgesics after a few days.

During his hospital stay, he had an uneventful recovery. His incision site appeared clean and without signs of infection. The patient was diligent in following the instructions of the healthcare team, including physical therapy exercises and managing his glucose levels. His blood glucose levels remained within the target range, and he was able to maintain his usual diet.

On day three of his hospitalization, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. His mobility improved daily, with the assistance of a walker. Prior to discharge, the physical therapist assessed the patient's ability to safely navigate stairs and perform daily activities.

The patient was discharged on day five of his hospitalization without any complications. He was instructed to continue his postoperative pain medications and attend scheduled physical therapy sessions as an outpatient. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician within one week to monitor his medical conditions and ensure his overall postoperative recovery.

Overall, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery and an uncomplicated postoperative course. His diligent adherence to postoperative care instructions and therapy contributed to his favorable outcome.
