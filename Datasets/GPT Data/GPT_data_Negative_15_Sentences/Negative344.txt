Patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for the treatment of a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril 10mg daily, and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes atorvastatin 20mg daily. He has a 20-pack year smoking history but quit smoking 5 years ago. His preoperative evaluation shows no evidence of acute renal failure and his renal function is within normal limits.

The patient's surgery for the herniated disc was performed without any immediate complications. He received adequate anesthesia without any adverse reactions to the medications used. The surgical team successfully removed the herniated disc and the patient tolerated the procedure well. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely for pain control and vital signs.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He experienced some mild postoperative pain, which was managed with a combination of oral analgesics and non-pharmacological interventions such as ice packs and physical therapy. He was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated and was assisted with early mobilization by the physical therapy team.

The patient did not experience any complications related to the surgery, such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or respiratory complications. His pain improved gradually over the course of the hospital stay and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any gastrointestinal issues. He was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with appropriate pain medications and instructions for follow-up.

During the postoperative period, the patient was advised to limit physical activity and avoid heavy lifting for a few weeks. He was provided with education on wound care and signs of infection to watch for. He was also advised to continue his medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia as prescribed and to follow up with his primary care physician for routine monitoring.

The patient attended his follow-up appointment two weeks after surgery. At that time, he reported a significant improvement in his back pain and was able to perform daily activities with minimal discomfort. Physical examination revealed well-healed surgical incision without signs of infection. The patient was encouraged to continue his physical therapy exercises and to gradually increase his activity level as tolerated.

In summary, the 55-year-old male patient underwent surgery for a herniated disc and had an uneventful postoperative course without any complications. He experienced mild postoperative pain, which was effectively managed, and showed improvement in his pain and functionality during the follow-up period. He will continue to be monitored by his primary care physician and physical therapist to ensure continued progress in his recovery.
