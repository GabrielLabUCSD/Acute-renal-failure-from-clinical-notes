The patient is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. He is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. 

His primary care physician has been managing his hypertension with a combination of medications, including an ACE inhibitor. His blood pressure has been relatively well controlled at an average of 130/80 mmHg. However, he occasionally experiences elevated blood pressure readings at home. 

The patient has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for the past seven years. He manages his diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents, including metformin and a sulfonylurea. He monitors his blood glucose levels regularly at home and reports good overall control with fasting levels between 90-110 mg/dL and postprandial levels below 160 mg/dL. 

Regarding his surgical history, he had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy five years ago without any complications. His anesthesia record from that surgery indicates no difficulties during intubation or extubation. 

The patient's body mass index (BMI) is currently 35 kg/mÂ², indicating obesity. He has struggled with weight management over the years, attempting different diets without long-term success. He exercises intermittently but does not engage in regular physical activity. 

Regarding his social history, the patient is a current smoker with a 20 pack-year history. He reports smoking 10 cigarettes per day on average. He has made previous unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking.

In terms of allergies, the patient has a documented allergy to penicillin, presenting as a skin rash when exposed to the medication in the past.

The patient reports an unremarkable family history, with no known inherited conditions or diseases in close relatives.

Following the hernia repair surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He required minimal pain control with oral analgesics and had no signs of infection. His vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period. 

The patient was mobilized early and encouraged to engage in deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications, such as pneumonia. 

No complications, such as wound dehiscence, seroma formation, or hematoma, were observed during the patient's postoperative follow-up visits. 

The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable during the postoperative period. He continued to manage his chronic conditions with his usual medications. 

Given the absence of complications, the patient was discharged home on day two after surgery with appropriate postoperative instructions and follow-up appointments.

Acute renal failure was not exhibited as a complication during the patient's postoperative course.
