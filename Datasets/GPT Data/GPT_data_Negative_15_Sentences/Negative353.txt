The patient in question is a middle-aged individual who is scheduled to have surgery. Their medical history reveals a diagnosis of hypertension for the past five years, which is well-controlled with medication. They also have a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for ten years, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or substance abuse. They have a body mass index (BMI) of 28, indicating they are overweight but not obese.

In terms of their surgical history, the patient has had appendectomy surgery in their early twenties, which was uneventful. They have never had any other major surgeries. The patient does not have any known drug allergies.

Their preoperative assessment indicates normal vital signs, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Laboratory results showed a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.5%, indicating fair control of diabetes. Serum creatinine levels were within normal limits, ruling out any underlying renal dysfunction.

During the postoperative course, the patient is closely monitored for vital signs and pain control. They are started on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin injections. The patient is encouraged to start ambulation as early as possible to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's recovery progresses well without any immediate complications such as wound infections or bleeding. Pain control is well-managed using a combination of intravenous analgesics and non-opioid medications. They are able to tolerate a regular diet without any signs of postoperative ileus.

On the second postoperative day, the patient's blood glucose levels are still elevated but gradually decreasing. Insulin therapy is initiated to achieve target blood glucose levels of less than 180mg/dL. The patient is educated on insulin administration and monitoring techniques to ensure proper self-management of diabetes.

Throughout their hospital stay, the patient's blood pressure remains within normal limits, with no signs of hypertensive crisis. Their urine output is well-maintained, ruling out any renal complications. The patient is discharged on the fifth postoperative day with proper instructions, prescriptions, and a follow-up appointment scheduled.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course can be described as uneventful. They did not experience any acute complications related to the surgery, anesthesia, or wound healing. However, their diabetes management required close monitoring and adjustment to achieve optimal blood glucose control. The patient was compliant and actively involved in their postoperative care, contributing to their successful recovery.
