The patient, a 56-year-old male named John Doe, is preparing for surgery. He has a significant medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and has a BMI of 30, indicating obesity. He had a previous myocardial infarction six years ago and underwent angioplasty with stenting at that time. His current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and aspirin.

In the past year, he has experienced recurrent angina despite optimal medical therapy. As a result, his cardiologist has recommended coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery to improve blood flow to his heart muscles. His recent cardiac catheterization showed severe coronary artery disease involving the left main and three major coronary arteries. His left ventricular ejection fraction was 40%, indicating reduced heart function.

John Doe is scheduled for CABG surgery in two weeks. He has been counseled about the importance of smoking cessation and increasing his physical activity in preparation for surgery. He underwent preoperative clearance from the anesthesiology department and underwent comprehensive preoperative testing including bloodwork, a chest X-ray, and an echocardiogram.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, with a median sternotomy approach. Intraoperatively, four bypass grafts were completed using the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein grafts to the other diseased coronary arteries. The procedure lasted four hours, and he had a smooth intraoperative course.

Postoperatively, John Doe was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for monitoring. He received analgesia and was closely observed for any signs of bleeding or infection. His blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were stable. The SICU team emphasized early mobilization and respiratory physiotherapy to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

John Doe's postoperative course was uneventful. He recovered well from the surgery and was gradually weaned off medications for pain. His vital signs remained stable, and his surgical incision showed good healing. He was able to participate in physical therapy and walked short distances with assistance. The respiratory therapy team assisted him with breathing exercises and monitored his lung function. His chest X-ray showed no evidence of new abnormalities.

Throughout his hospital stay, the nursing staff ensured that he followed cardiac rehabilitation guidelines, including a low-sodium diet and medication compliance. The multidisciplinary team provided education about lifestyle modifications and the importance of continuing his medications after discharge. He was discharged home on postoperative day seven, with appropriate instructions for wound care and follow-up with his cardiologist.

John Doe did not experience any complications during his postoperative course. He did not have any respiratory issues, wound infections, or major bleeding episodes. Follow-up appointments were scheduled for two weeks and six weeks after discharge to monitor his recovery and cardiac function. Overall, John Doe had a successful CABG surgery and a smooth postoperative recovery.
