The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has been taking metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin for the past 10 years to manage these conditions. The patient also has a family history of coronary artery disease.

He has recently been diagnosed with bilateral knee osteoarthritis, which has been causing significant pain and limitations in his mobility. Conservative management with physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have not provided significant relief. Hence, the patient has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient has been evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including an orthopedic surgeon, an anesthesiologist, and a nurse practitioner. He has completed all the necessary preoperative workup, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels have been well-controlled.

On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room where he received general anesthesia. The surgical procedure was successful, and the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure.

In the PACU, the patient received appropriate pain management with analgesics and was closely monitored for any signs of complications such as bleeding or infection. He was then transferred to the orthopedic unit for further postoperative care.

The patient's postoperative course has been uneventful. The orthopedic team has initiated a comprehensive rehabilitation program to help the patient regain strength and mobility in his knee. Physical therapy sessions have been scheduled daily, focusing on exercises to improve range of motion and muscle strength.

The patient's pain has been managed adequately with a combination of oral analgesics and epidural infusions. The surgical wound has been healing well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient has been encouraged to practice proper wound care and to follow up with the orthopedic surgeon for routine postoperative visits.

He has been provided with education regarding his medications and has been advised to continue taking his usual antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications. The patient's blood glucose levels have been closely monitored, and adjustments to his diabetic medications have been made as necessary.

During the postoperative period, the patient did not experience any complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. He did not develop any respiratory or cardiac issues. However, the patient did experience a minor wound infection at the surgical site, which was successfully treated with antibiotics and wound care. The infection resolved without any further complications.

Overall, the patient has had a successful total knee replacement surgery with an uneventful postoperative course, except for the minor wound infection which was properly managed. The patient is expected to continue progressing well with physical therapy and is looking forward to returning to his normal activities with improved mobility and decreased pain.
