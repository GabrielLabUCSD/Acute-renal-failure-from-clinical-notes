The patient takes metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin to manage these conditions. His blood pressure is well controlled, with the most recent reading being 120/80 mmHg. His HbA1c level is 7%, indicating fair glycemic control, and his lipid panel is within normal limits.

The patient has a history of smoking but quit four years ago. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. He denies any respiratory symptoms or history of lung disease. His lung function tests, including spirometry and chest x-ray, are normal. His oxygen saturation levels are consistently above 95% on room air.

His surgical history includes a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. His recovery from that surgery was uneventful, with no postoperative complications. He has no known drug allergies and has never had adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient's cardiovascular history is significant for coronary artery disease. He had an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) two years ago, for which he underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. He is currently asymptomatic, with no chest pain, shortness of breath, or exercise intolerance. His most recent stress test showed no evidence of ischemia or exercise-induced arrhythmias. His echocardiogram reveals normal left ventricular function.

He has a body mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m2, indicating overweight status. However, he has been actively working on weight reduction and has successfully lost 10 pounds in the past six months. He reports a well-balanced diet with increased physical activity.

Following the surgery, the patient had an unremarkable postoperative course. He recovered well, with minimal pain controlled by oral analgesics. He had no surgical site infections or wound healing complications. He resumed his regular activities gradually and had a normal bowel function post-surgery.

The patient did not experience any postoperative complications. His vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period, and his blood glucose levels were well controlled. He received regular follow-up care and was discharged home on the third postoperative day in a satisfactory condition.

In summary, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He is planning to undergo hernia repair surgery. His preoperative evaluation reveals well-controlled blood pressure, fair glycemic control, and normal renal function. He has successfully quit smoking and has been working on weight reduction. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications observed.
