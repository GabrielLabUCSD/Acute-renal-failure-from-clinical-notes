The patient currently takes several medications including lisinopril for blood pressure control, metformin for diabetes management, and atorvastatin for cholesterol control.

In the past, the patient has undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery approximately two years ago due to severe coronary artery disease. He has been doing well since the surgery, with no evidence of any complications or signs of graft occlusion.

The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled with lisinopril, maintaining it within the target range. He monitors his blood sugar regularly at home and follows a diabetic diet advised by a nutritionist. The patient's glycemic control has been satisfactory with his current metformin dosage.

Further evaluation of the patient's surgical risk profile reveals no contraindications for surgery. His preoperative laboratory results, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, are within normal limits. The patient is also up-to-date with his vaccinations, including tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines.

Regarding the surgical procedure, the patient will undergo general anesthesia and is being prepared for the necessary preoperative evaluations which include obtaining informed consent, ensuring fasting status, and starting prophylactic antibiotics.

Following the surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was closely monitored in the postoperative recovery unit for any signs of complications, such as bleeding or infection. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he had adequate pain control using intravenous opioids. In terms of wound healing, the surgical incision appeared clean and without any signs of infection.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient received appropriate postoperative care including early ambulation and respiratory exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis or atelectasis. The patient's vital signs continued to remain stable, and he did not require additional interventions during his hospital stay.

He was discharged home on postoperative day four with appropriate pain management instructions, wound care instructions, and follow-up instructions for his primary care physician. The patient was recommended to continue his regular medications and instructed to avoid strenuous activities until further clearance from his surgeon.
