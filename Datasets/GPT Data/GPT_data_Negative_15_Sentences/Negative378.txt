The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. He presents to the hospital for surgery secondary to chronic knee pain and functional impairment. He has previously tried conservative management options without success.

His hypertension is well-controlled with medication, and his last blood pressure reading was 130/80 mmHg. His diabetes is managed with an oral hypoglycemic agent, and his most recent HbA1c level was 7.2%. His BMI is 35 kg/m2.

The patient has been on antihypertensive medication for the past five years and has had no documented episodes of cardiac arrhythmias or angina. He does not have a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

His preoperative lab work shows a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 75 mL/min/1.73m2, indicating mild renal impairment.

He has no known drug allergies and reports no prior adverse reactions to anesthesia or prior surgeries. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.

On physical examination, his vital signs are stable, and he has no significant cardiovascular or respiratory findings. His knee joint shows signs of osteoarthritis, with crepitus, limited range of motion, and tenderness on palpation.

The patient underwent surgery without any immediate complications. He received general anesthesia and had an unremarkable intraoperative period. The surgical procedure was performed without difficulties, and the surgical team noted no excessive bleeding, nerve injury, or infection.

Postoperatively, the patient was placed on appropriate pain management protocols, including oral analgesics and physical therapy. He tolerated a regular diet and ambulated with the assistance of a walker on the first postoperative day.

During his hospital stay, the patient did not develop any signs of surgical site infection or deep vein thrombosis. He maintained his blood pressure control throughout his stay, and his blood glucose levels were within target range.

The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively. There were no electrolyte imbalances or any signs of acute kidney injury. He did not require any renal replacement therapy or other medical interventions related to his renal function.

Given his good postoperative recovery, the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. He was provided with appropriate instructions for wound care, pain management, and follow-up. The patient was advised to continue his regular medications and was scheduled for a postoperative visit with his primary care physician in two weeks.
