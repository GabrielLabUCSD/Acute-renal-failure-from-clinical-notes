The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital for elective surgery due to chronic knee pain and bilateral knee osteoarthritis. His knee pain has been progressively worsening over the past six months, limiting his ability to perform daily activities and impacting his quality of life.

The patient’s preoperative evaluation revealed moderately controlled blood pressure with medications, a hemoglobin A1c of 7.8% indicating suboptimal glycemic control, and elevated lipid profile despite taking statin therapy. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no significant conduction abnormalities. Laboratory studies including renal function tests were within normal limits, except for mild proteinuria.

Prior to scheduling surgery, the patient met with his primary care physician, an anesthesiologist, and the orthopedic surgeon. An interdisciplinary approach was taken to optimize the patient's overall health prior to surgery. The patient was advised to strictly control his blood pressure and blood glucose levels in the perioperative period to minimize the risk of complications. He was also referred to physical therapy for preoperative conditioning to improve muscle strength and range of motion.

The patient underwent successful bilateral total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, there were no significant complications. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, infection, thromboembolic events, and any other potential complications. Prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulant therapy were administered per protocol.

The patient’s postoperative course was generally uneventful. He received physical therapy, including range of motion exercises and ambulation, starting on the second postoperative day. The patient's pain was well controlled with a combination of non-opioid analgesics and opioid medication as needed. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and bowel function was normal. The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were closely monitored and remained within target ranges.

No significant postoperative complications were noted during the hospital stay. The patient's incisions were healing well and there were no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. DVT prophylaxis was continued until discharge, and no thromboembolic events occurred. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day four with appropriate pain medications and a plan for outpatient physical therapy.

At the most recent follow-up visit, two months postoperatively, the patient reported significant improvement in knee pain, increased mobility, and ability to perform daily activities without limitations. He was compliant with physical therapy and had resumed normal blood pressure and blood glucose control. The patient was satisfied with the surgical outcome and experienced no complications that required further intervention.
