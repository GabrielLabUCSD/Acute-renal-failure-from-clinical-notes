Patient XYZ, a 45-year-old male, with a history of hypertension and diabetes, presented to our hospital for an elective surgery. The patientâ€™s hypertension has been managed with losartan for the past five years, and his diabetes is controlled through diet and exercise. He has no known drug allergies.

The surgical procedure planned is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat symptomatic gallstones. He has been experiencing recurrent bouts of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting over the past six months due to these gallstones.

During preoperative evaluation, his blood pressure was found to be well-controlled with a reading of 130/80 mmHg. His blood glucose level was within the normal range at 110 mg/dL. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count and coagulation profile, were within normal limits as well.

On further history taking, the patient revealed a smoking history of 20 pack-years but quit smoking ten years ago. He occasionally consumes alcohol in moderation. No other significant past medical or surgical history was reported.

As part of the preoperative workup, a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram were performed, demonstrating no abnormal findings. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of multiple gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis.

The patient was advised to stop taking any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications one week before the surgery. He was also instructed to fast from midnight of the night before the procedure.

The laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed under general anesthesia, lasting approximately one hour. The patient tolerated the surgery well without any intraoperative complications.

In the postoperative period, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with vital signs being monitored regularly. Pain management was achieved with intravenous opioids in the immediate postoperative period and later transitioned to oral analgesics.

The patient was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day and experienced no signs of ileus or surgical-site complications. Early ambulation was also initiated to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's pain gradually subsided, and his vital signs remained stable throughout the hospital stay. No surgical site infections or other complications were observed during the recovery period.

On the morning of the third postoperative day, the patient was discharged home in stable condition with instructions for follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and surgeon.

In summary, Patient XYZ, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes, underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. The surgery proceeded without any intraoperative complications, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged on the third postoperative day with no complications observed.
