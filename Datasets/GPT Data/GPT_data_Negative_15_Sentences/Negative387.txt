The patient in question is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has been on a combination of medications including lisinopril and metformin to manage these conditions. The patient's blood pressure has been relatively well controlled with a recent systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 78 mmHg. His diabetes has been managed with an average HbA1c of 7.2%.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had a cholecystectomy 5 years ago for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient had a smooth postoperative course. He did not experience any complications such as wound infection or bile leakage. 

The patient's surgical procedure this time is scheduled to be an elective inguinal hernia repair. The patient has been experiencing intermittent right groin pain for the past 6 months with occasional bulging in the area. Physical examination revealed a reducible inguinal hernia. In order to reduce the risk of surgical site infection, the patient will undergo preoperative hair removal using clippers rather than shaving. 

In terms of preoperative testing, the patient had a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile done. All the results were within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL. The patient was advised to continue taking his regular medications but to avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight prior to the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the surgical floor. His vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period, with blood pressure ranging from 120/70 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg and heart rate between 70 and 80 beats per minute. He was started on a clear liquid diet and advanced to a regular diet on postoperative day 1, tolerating both well.

The patient was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated on postoperative day 1. He reported mild incisional pain, which was managed with oral acetaminophen as needed. The surgical site was inspected daily, and no signs of infection or dehiscence were noted. The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored during his hospital stay, and he was managed with sliding scale insulin to maintain glycemic control.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 2 with instructions to gradually increase his activity level and avoid heavy lifting for the next 4 weeks. He was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the surgeon in 2 weeks to assess wound healing and address any concerns. No complications, including acute renal failure, were noted during the patient's surgical experience.
