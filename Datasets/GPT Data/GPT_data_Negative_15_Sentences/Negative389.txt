The patient is a 58-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure is well-controlled on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic combination, and his lipid levels are managed with statin therapy. He takes metformin for his diabetes and has stable blood glucose levels with HbA1c within target range for the past year.

The patient's past surgical history includes an appendectomy performed 5 years ago without any complications. He has no known drug allergies. He does not smoke and does not consume alcohol regularly. He leads an active lifestyle, participating in regular physical exercise.

Preoperatively, he underwent a thorough evaluation by the anesthesiology team and was cleared for surgery. His preoperative laboratory tests showed within normal limits for complete blood count, renal function, liver function, and coagulation studies. He was advised to stop taking his ACE inhibitor and diuretic one day prior to surgery to minimize any complications related to blood pressure control.

The patient received appropriate preoperative teaching regarding the surgery, anesthesia, and postoperative care. He was educated on deep breathing exercises, pain management strategies, and the importance of early ambulation after surgery to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring. He received appropriate pain management and was encouraged to use incentive spirometry to promote lung expansion.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any undue pain or discomfort. He was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet and was instructed to slowly progress to a regular diet as tolerated. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation to prevent surgical site infection and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient was kept under close monitoring during his hospital stay. He developed no signs of systemic infection or wound complications. He remained compliant with his ambulation exercises and was able to achieve good pain control with oral analgesics. He received regular visits from the physical therapy team to facilitate his recovery and ensure early mobilization.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with appropriate instructions for wound care and limitations on physical activity. He was prescribed oral analgesics for pain management and advised to continue prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation as an outpatient.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He did not experience any complications such as wound infection, respiratory complications, or bleeding. He had a follow-up visit scheduled with his surgeon in two weeks to assess the surgical site and ensure continued healing. Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful, and he is expected to make a full recovery without any further interventions needed.
