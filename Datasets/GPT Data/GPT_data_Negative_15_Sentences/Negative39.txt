The patient in question is scheduled to undergo surgery, requiring a comprehensive medical summary to ensure their safety during the procedure. Their medical history reveals a 45-year-old individual with a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and asthma. They have a body mass index (BMI) of 35.8, indicative of obesity.

The patient's hypertension has been well-controlled with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) and calcium channel blocker. Their diabetes management consists of metformin and lifestyle modifications, with stable glycemic control. They occasionally use short-acting beta-agonists for asthma exacerbations.

Preoperative investigations were conducted within six months and showed normal results for a complete blood count, renal function, liver enzymes, and a chest X-ray, indicating no significant abnormalities. They are a non-smoker with no history of alcohol or substance abuse.

During the preoperative assessment, it was noted that the patient had a slight difficulty with exercise tolerance and experienced dyspnea on exertion. Further evaluation revealed a normal echocardiogram, suggesting they do not have significant cardiac disease. However, the patient was referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation due to the possibility of undiagnosed moderate-to-severe obstructive lung disease.

The patient's surgical plan involves an open cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. Given their obesity and potential underlying pulmonary pathology, it has been decided that an anesthetic consultation will be required preoperatively to optimize their lung function and mitigate the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

Following the surgery, the patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course with gradual recovery. Their pain was adequately managed with opioid analgesics initially, followed by transition to non-opioid alternatives. The patient was closely monitored for potential complications, including wound infection, thromboembolism, and respiratory compromise.

Fortunately, the patient did not develop any significant postoperative complications and was able to tolerate a normal diet. They were promptly transferred to the general ward for routine postoperative care. A multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, anesthetists, and physiotherapists, provided appropriate postoperative support for optimal recovery.

In conclusion, a 45-year-old patient with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and asthma underwent an uneventful open cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. Their postoperative course was uncomplicated, and they did not experience any major complications.
