Preoperative laboratory results revealed a normal complete blood count and renal function with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient underwent surgery a week later and the procedure was uneventful. He received general anesthesia without any complications during the placement of spinal anesthesia. The estimated blood loss during surgery was approximately 300 mL. The patient was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit and was started on intravenous non-opioid analgesics for pain control.
