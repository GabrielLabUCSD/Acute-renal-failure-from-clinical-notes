The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. His hypertension is currently well controlled with lisinopril 20 mg daily, and his diabetes is managed through diet and exercise. He had a myocardial infarction three years ago and received a percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. He takes aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily.

In terms of his surgical history, he had a cholecystectomy 10 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. He had an uneventful postoperative course and recovered without any complications. He also had a hernia repair surgery two years ago, which was successful and had no complications.

On physical examination, the patient is well-nourished and in no apparent distress. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, and cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or gallops. There are no signs of peripheral vascular disease, such as diminished peripheral pulses or skin changes.

Laboratory investigations reveal a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, HbA1c of 7.2%, total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 45 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 150 mg/dL. Renal function tests including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and estimated glomerular filtration rate are within normal limits.

The patient's preoperative evaluation includes an electrocardiogram, which shows normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave changes. Chest x-ray shows clear lung fields without any infiltrates or effusions. An echocardiogram reveals preserved left ventricular function with no significant valvular abnormalities or evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities.

The surgical procedure planned is an elective inguinal hernia repair. The patient is educated about the procedure, including the risks and benefits, and gives informed consent.

Postoperatively, the patient is monitored closely for any complications. He is started on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin. Pain control is managed with intravenous opioids initially, followed by transition to oral analgesics as tolerated. The patient is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and atelectasis.

The patient has an uneventful postoperative course and recovers well. He tolerates a regular diet without any nausea or vomiting. He is able to pass gas and has normal bowel movements. His surgical incision appears clean and dry without any signs of infection. He is discharged home on postoperative day 2 with appropriate instructions for wound care and follow-up appointments.

In conclusion, the patient's medical history includes well-controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He has undergone previous surgeries of cholecystectomy and hernia repair without complications. His preoperative evaluation reveals stable vital signs, normal physical examination findings, and laboratory values within normal limits. He undergoes an elective inguinal hernia repair, recovers well postoperatively, and is discharged home without complications.
