The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed 5 years ago for symptomatic gallstones, with an uneventful postoperative course. He has never had any previous complications related to anesthesia or surgery.

On physical examination, the patient is in good overall health, with vital signs within normal limits. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is a reducible bulge consistent with a hernia in the right inguinal region. There are no other significant findings on examination.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent routine laboratory tests, which included a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile - all of which were within normal limits. He also had an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm.

The patient was cleared for surgery by both his primary care physician and a cardiologist, who deemed him low risk for perioperative complications. He received appropriate preoperative counseling and was instructed on fasting requirements prior to surgery.

The surgery was performed as planned under general anesthesia. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no significant intraoperative events.

The postoperative course was unremarkable. The patient's pain was adequately controlled with analgesics, and he was able to resume a regular diet within 24 hours of surgery. He ambulated without difficulty and did not experience any postoperative complications such as wound infection or hematoma formation.

Follow-up visits were scheduled for the patient postoperatively to monitor wound healing and ensure there were no signs of recurrence or other surgical complications. The patient was also advised to continue his regular medications and follow a healthy lifestyle to manage his chronic medical conditions.

In summary, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair.
