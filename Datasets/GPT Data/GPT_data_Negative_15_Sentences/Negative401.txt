The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a previous myocardial infarction. He is currently on metoprolol, lisinopril, and metformin for his medical conditions. The patient had a stent placed in the left anterior descending artery two years ago.

Additionally, he has a history of chronic kidney disease (stage 3) with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL. The patient's renal function has been stable, without any previous episodes of acute renal failure. He denies any symptoms of fluid overload or difficulty breathing.

The surgical procedure planned is an elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Preoperative investigations revealed no abnormal liver function tests, and the patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits. He has been advised to discontinue his metformin 48 hours before surgery due to potential issues with kidney function and lactic acidosis.

Postoperatively, the patient's recovery is uneventful. He is closely monitored for any signs of infection, including wound redness or increased pain. Pain management is achieved with opioid analgesics, including patient-controlled analgesia. The patient is encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent postoperative complications such as venous thromboembolism.

The patient has no complications during his hospital stay. His renal function remains stable and there are no signs of acute kidney injury. The surgical wound is clean and healing well. Antibiotics are continued for 24 hours postoperatively as per protocol.

During discharge, the patient receives detailed instructions on wound care, pain management, and signs of infection. He is scheduled for follow-up evaluation in two weeks for a wound check. The patient is advised to continue his regular medications, including antihypertensives and metformin as long as his renal function remains stable.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. He underwent an elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis without any perioperative complications. Postoperatively, he has a smooth recovery with no signs of acute renal failure or wound infections. The patient is educated about appropriate postoperative care and follow-up arrangements.
