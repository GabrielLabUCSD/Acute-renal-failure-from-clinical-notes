The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease. He is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol for his hypertension, metformin for his diabetes, albuterol inhaler for his COPD, and aspirin for his coronary artery disease.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient had a previous appendectomy at the age of 40 and a cholecystectomy at the age of 55. He had no complications with either surgery. Additionally, he has a family history of heart disease with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent routine laboratory tests including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies. His results were within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated blood glucose level. He was advised to monitor his blood glucose levels closely and adjust his diabetes medication as necessary in the perioperative period.

The patient also underwent a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram (ECG), both of which were normal. However, an echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced ejection fraction. This finding was discussed with the patient, and it was determined that his surgery could proceed as planned with appropriate cardiac monitoring and management.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for any complications. He received prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infection. His blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and respiratory function were closely monitored. Pain control was managed with a combination of oral analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no immediate complications noted. He remained in the hospital for three days, during which time he was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

After discharge, the patient was advised to continue his regular medications and follow up with his primary care physician. He was also instructed to closely monitor his blood glucose levels and report any abnormalities. A follow-up appointment was scheduled with his surgeon in two weeks to assess his surgical site and ensure proper healing.

In summary, this 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, COPD, and coronary artery disease underwent surgery without complications. He was managed perioperatively with appropriate monitoring and received prophylactic antibiotics for infection prevention. Postoperative care focused on pain control, ambulation, and respiratory exercises. The patient's surgical incision is healing well, and he is scheduled for follow-up appointments with both his primary care physician and surgeon.
