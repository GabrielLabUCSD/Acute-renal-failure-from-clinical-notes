The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on medication for both conditions, with his blood pressure and cholesterol levels well controlled. Additionally, he has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, which is also managed with medication, and he maintains good glycemic control.

The patient has a family history of heart disease, with both his father and brother having experienced myocardial infarctions in their 50s. As a result, he has been diligent about maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet.

Over the past few years, the patient has been experiencing progressive knee pain and swelling, which has significantly impacted his quality of life. Physical examination revealed degenerative changes in both knees, and imaging studies confirmed severe osteoarthritis. After discussion with his orthopedic surgeon, the decision was made to proceed with a total knee replacement surgery.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative assessment, which included blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and a chest x-ray. These tests showed no significant abnormalities, confirming his overall good health.

The patient underwent the total knee replacement surgery without any complications. In the immediate postoperative period, he received adequate pain control with a combination of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He was encouraged to begin physical therapy the day after surgery, focusing on regaining strength and range of motion.

During the first few days following surgery, the patient experienced the expected postoperative pain and swelling, which were managed effectively with analgesics and ice packs. He gradually started bearing weight on the operative leg under the guidance of the physical therapist.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of infection or wound healing complications. His vital signs remained stable, and he maintained good glucose control throughout the hospital stay. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was initiated, consisting of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin injections.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was ambulating with the assistance of a walker and showed significant improvement in pain and mobility. The orthopedic surgeon deemed him ready for discharge with appropriate medications and a plan for outpatient physical therapy.

At the follow-up visit two weeks later, the patient reported continued improvement in pain and function. He was able to ambulate without any assistive devices, albeit with some mild discomfort. His surgical incision appeared clean and well-healed.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, without any complications. His commitment to a healthy lifestyle and diligent management of his chronic conditions contributed to his successful surgical outcome and prompt recovery.
