During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and the hernia repair was performed without any complications. The surgery lasted approximately two hours. 

In the postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for vital signs, wound healing, and pain control. Vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period. The patient was able to ambulate on the same day of the surgery and was encouraged to engage in deep breathing exercises to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia. 

The patient's wound healing was uneventful with no signs of infection or dehiscence. He was given intravenous antibiotics for 24 hours and then switched to oral antibiotics to complete a seven-day course. 

Pain management was achieved with the use of a patient-controlled analgesia pump, which provided effective pain control. The patient reported a pain score of 2 out of 10 on the visual analog scale. 

No postoperative complications such as bleeding, hematoma formation, or wound infection were noted during the patient's hospital stay. The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day, with instructions for wound care, pain management, and follow-up with his primary care physician. 

Overall, the patient had a successful hernia repair surgery without any significant complications in the postoperative course.
