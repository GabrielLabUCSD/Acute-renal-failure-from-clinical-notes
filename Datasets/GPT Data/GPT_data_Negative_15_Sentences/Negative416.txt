He had a previous CABG surgery without complications. His preoperative evaluation was unremarkable, and his surgery was performed without immediate complications. His postoperative course was smooth, with adequate pain control and no evidence of complications. The patient is expected to have a favorable recovery and be discharged upon meeting the appropriate postoperative milestones.
