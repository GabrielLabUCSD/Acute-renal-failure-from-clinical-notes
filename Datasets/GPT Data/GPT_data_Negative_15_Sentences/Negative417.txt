The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and statin therapy. His blood pressure is well controlled with a last recorded measurement of 125/80 mmHg. His diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and his last HbA1c level was 6.8%. His hyperlipidemia is also well controlled with a total cholesterol level of 160 mg/dL.

The patient has a past surgical history of an appendectomy performed 10 years ago, and he reports no complications from that procedure. He does not have any known drug allergies. He has a moderate smoking history with approximately 10 pack-years of exposure, but he quit smoking 5 years ago. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. The patient has a stable cardiopulmonary status with no evidence of congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient is planning to undergo an elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. He initially presented with intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and an ultrasound revealed the presence of gallstones. The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of pain despite modifications to his diet, which has prompted the decision to proceed with surgery. He has undergone a preoperative evaluation that included routine laboratory tests, an electrocardiogram, and a chest x-ray, all of which were within normal limits.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He tolerated the surgery well and there were no intraoperative complications. He was closely monitored in the recovery room and was able to ambulate without difficulty. Pain control was achieved with a combination of oral analgesics and he was encouraged to resume a regular diet after an initial period of clear liquids. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period. He was discharged home on the second postoperative day and instructed to follow up with his primary care physician in one week. No complications, including acute renal failure, were observed during his hospital stay or at the time of discharge.
