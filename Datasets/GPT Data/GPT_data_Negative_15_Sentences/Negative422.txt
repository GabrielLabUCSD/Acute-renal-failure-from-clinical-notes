The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a past medical history significant for hypertension and mild dyslipidemia. He presents with symptoms of severe left-sided hip pain that has been progressively worsening over the last six months. The pain has been resistant to conservative management, including physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He has decided to undergo left total hip replacement surgery to improve his quality of life and relieve pain.

The patient's preoperative workup includes a comprehensive medical assessment. Laboratory investigations reveal no significant abnormalities, with normal complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. His electrocardiogram is unremarkable, and he has good exercise tolerance on stress testing. Chest X-ray demonstrates clear lung fields, and the patient has a negative result on a preoperative COVID-19 test.

During the hip replacement surgery, the patient receives general anesthesia without any complications. The procedure is performed without any significant intraoperative challenges, and the patient is in a stable condition throughout. He receives appropriate prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to prevent infection and thromboembolic events.

Postoperatively, the patient is closely monitored in the recovery unit. He is started on multimodal pain management, consisting of opioids, non-opioid analgesics, and regional anesthesia techniques. Physical therapy is initiated on the day of surgery to facilitate early mobilization. The patient is encouraged to perform range of motion exercises and ambulate with the assistance of a walker.

The patient's postoperative course is unremarkable, with no signs of wound infection or deep venous thrombosis. He experiences some expected postoperative pain, which is effectively managed with the prescribed pain medications. The patient is able to tolerate a regular diet, and his bowel and bladder function are normal. He remains hemodynamically stable, and his vital signs are within normal limits.

Over the next few days, the patient continues to show improvement in his mobility and pain control. Physical therapy sessions are well tolerated, and he gradually progresses from using a walker to a cane. He receives appropriate medications for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism until he is discharged. The patient is advised to continue pain management and physical therapy as an outpatient.

Upon discharge, the patient is given detailed instructions for wound care and follow-up appointments. He is educated about signs and symptoms of complications to watch for, such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is also advised on strategies to prevent falls and maintain his hip precautions to ensure optimal healing.

In summary, the patient underwent a left total hip replacement surgery for severe hip pain. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He achieved good pain control, early mobilization, and showed steady progress in his recovery, ultimately transitioning to a cane. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions contributed to his successful outcome.
