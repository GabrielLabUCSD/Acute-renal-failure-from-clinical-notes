Patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and a prior history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and aspirin.

During the preoperative examination, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was found to be in fair overall health. Laboratory results revealed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels, with HbA1c within target range. His lipid panel showed well-controlled cholesterol levels.

The patient reported a history of smoking, but he quit five years ago. He denied any symptoms of angina or myocardial infarction. His physical examination was unremarkable, with no abnormal heart or lung sounds.

Given his medical history and prior CABG surgery, the surgical team evaluated the patient's cardiovascular system in detail. The patient underwent an electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and stress test, which all indicated good cardiac function with no signs of myocardial ischemia or heart failure.

The surgical procedure was thoroughly explained to the patient, and he understood the risks and benefits involved. An informed consent was signed, and the patient was given instructions for fasting prior to surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for signs of hemodynamic instability or respiratory distress. He received appropriate analgesia and antibiotics as per protocol. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period.

While the patient did not experience any major complications, he did develop a surgical site infection, which was managed with wound care, appropriate antibiotics, and regular follow-up visits. The infection gradually resolved, and the patient was discharged in stable condition, with instructions for continued wound care.

The patient was advised to continue taking his regular medications as prescribed and follow-up regularly with his primary care physician. He was also instructed to monitor blood glucose levels closely due to the surgical stress, collaborate with a nutritionist to optimize his diet, and engage in regular physical activity.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, except for the surgical site infection. He remained compliant with his medications and lifestyle modifications, and there were no indications of acute renal failure or other serious complications. The patient's prognosis was favorable, with the expectation of continued recovery and improvement of the surgical wound.
