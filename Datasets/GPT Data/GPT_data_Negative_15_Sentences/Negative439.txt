The patient is a 55-year-old female who presented with symptoms of chronic knee pain and limited mobility. She has a past medical history of osteoarthritis, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The patient has been managing her conditions with regular exercise and a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen for pain relief.

Radiographic evaluation of the patient's knee revealed severe degenerative changes, with loss of joint space and osteophyte formation. Conservative management measures such as physical therapy and intra-articular corticosteroid injections were undertaken, but the patient did not experience significant relief.

After discussing the options with an orthopedic surgeon, the patient decided to proceed with a total knee replacement surgery. Preoperative investigations including basic blood work, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest X-ray were within normal limits. She was also optimized on her hypertension medications, with blood pressure consistently controlled around 130/80 mmHg.

The patient underwent the surgery under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. In the immediate postoperative period, she received prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to prevent infection and deep vein thrombosis. Physical therapy was initiated the day after surgery to promote early mobilization and enhance joint range of motion.

During her hospital stay, the patient's pain was managed with a multimodal analgesic regimen, including opioids, NSAIDs, and local anesthesia. She was also closely monitored for potential complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, and respiratory complications.

The patient's postoperative course was generally unremarkable, with no signs of infection or thromboembolic events. Her pain was well controlled, and she started bearing weight on the operated limb with the assistance of a physical therapist. The patient was able to eventually discharge home in a stable condition after five days in the hospital.

On follow-up visits, the patient demonstrated steady progress in her recovery. She continued to receive physical therapy and gradually regained functionality in her knee joint. No wound healing issues or persistent pain were reported.

In summary, a 55-year-old female with a history of osteoarthritis and other comorbidities underwent total knee replacement surgery to address her chronic knee pain and limited mobility. The surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient had a smooth postoperative course without any immediate complications. She experienced a successful recovery, showing improvement in pain and joint function in the follow-up period.
