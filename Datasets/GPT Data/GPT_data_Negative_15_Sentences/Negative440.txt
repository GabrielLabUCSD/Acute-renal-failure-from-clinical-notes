The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He had a 30-pack-year smoking history and was currently on home oxygen therapy due to his severe COPD.

In terms of cardiovascular history, the patient had previously undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 5 years ago. He had a history of stable angina, with minimal exertional chest pain relieved by rest and nitroglycerin. His current medications include aspirin, a beta-blocker, a statin, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

The patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation to ensure that he was fit for surgery. His pulmonary function tests showed severe airflow limitation consistent with his chronic lung disease, with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 35% predicted. He underwent a stress test, which showed moderate reversible ischemia. Coronary angiography revealed severe triple-vessel disease, prompting the decision for a repeat CABG surgery.

During the surgery, the patient tolerated the procedure well and had uneventful anesthesia. He received appropriate prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Intraoperatively, he required cardiopulmonary bypass for the CABG procedure. The surgery was successful, with patent grafts confirmed by intraoperative angiography.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He was extubated on postoperative day (POD) 1, and his respiratory status improved with incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy. He was gradually weaned off oxygen therapy and maintained stable oxygen saturation. His pain was well-controlled with the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation (AF) on POD 3, for which he was initiated on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. He required rate control with the use of beta-blockers. During his hospital stay, he developed a non-surgical site infection, likely related to his chronic corticosteroid use for his COPD. He was treated with empirical antibiotics and had a favorable response.

Apart from these complications, the patient's overall recovery was uneventful. He was transferred to the general ward on POD 5 and successfully discharged home on POD 8. He was instructed to continue his cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation exercises and follow-up with his primary care physician for further management of his chronic medical conditions.

In conclusion, this patient with a significant medical history underwent a repeat CABG surgery with an uncomplicated intraoperative course. Postoperatively, he experienced atrial fibrillation, which was managed with anticoagulation, and a non-surgical site infection, which resolved with antibiotics. He had an otherwise smooth recovery and was discharged home in stable condition.
