The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. His medical history is significant for hypertension, which is currently well controlled with medication. He also has a history of occasional episodes of gout, which is managed with lifestyle modifications and occasional use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having had a myocardial infarction in his early 50s. However, the patient has never had any cardiovascular symptoms or events, and his lipid profile is within normal limits. He does not smoke and consumes alcohol in moderation.

The patient has had previous surgeries, including an appendectomy in childhood and a tonsillectomy in his late teens, both without any complications. He has no known drug allergies.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, including a physical examination, laboratory tests, and an electrocardiogram. These tests revealed no abnormalities of concern. He was also seen by an anesthesiologist for a preoperative discussion, and no anesthesia-related concerns were identified.

The patient was adequately educated about the surgical procedure, the risks involved, and the expected postoperative recovery. He has a good understanding of the need to follow postoperative instructions, including activity restrictions, wound care, and analgesic use.

The surgery was performed without any complications, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He received general anesthesia and had an unremarkable intraoperative course. Postoperatively, the patient experienced mild pain at the incision site, which was managed with oral analgesics.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He was able to tolerate a regular diet the day after surgery and had normal bowel movements. He was ambulating well and did not require assistance with activities of daily living.

No signs of infection were noted at the surgical site, and the incision appeared to be healing well. The patient was advised to keep the incision site clean and dry, and to watch for any signs of redness, swelling, or drainage.

The patient was discharged home on the second day after surgery with a prescription for oral pain medication. He was instructed to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for a few weeks, but encouraged to gradually increase his activity level as tolerated.

Upon follow-up visit two weeks after surgery, the patient reported minimal pain and had fully resumed his normal activities. The incision site had completely healed, and no further interventions were necessary.

In summary, this patient with a history of hypertension and occasional gout underwent surgery for a hernia repair without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he had an excellent recovery. The patient's medical history and preoperative evaluation did not reveal any significant concerns, and he was able to resume his normal activities without limitations.
