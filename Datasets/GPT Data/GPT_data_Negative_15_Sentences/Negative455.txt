The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus who is planned for surgery. He has been on antihypertensive medication for the past five years and has had his blood pressure well controlled. His diabetes is well managed with oral hypoglycemic medications and has a stable HbA1c level of 6.8%.

He has no significant past surgical history and reports no known drug allergies. His preoperative laboratory results show normal renal function with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. His other laboratory values, including liver function tests and complete blood count, are within normal limits.

The patient has also undergone a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including an EKG and echocardiogram, which revealed no significant abnormalities. His exercise tolerance is good, and he denies any symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for several hours before being transferred to the surgical ward. He will receive appropriate pain management, including medications such as opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

To prevent postoperative complications, the patient will also be given prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. He will be encouraged to walk and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent the development of DVT and lung complications.

During his hospital stay, the patient will receive regular follow-up visits from the surgical team to assess wound healing and monitor for any signs of infection or other complications. He will also receive diabetic management and blood pressure control medications as needed.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to be uneventful, with a gradual improvement in pain and mobility. However, it is crucial to closely monitor his blood sugar levels to prevent any hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic episodes.

No complications were observed during the patient's postoperative course, and he was discharged on the fifth day after surgery with appropriate pain management instructions and follow-up appointments scheduled. He was advised to continue his antihypertensive and diabetic medications.
