Mr. X is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is due to undergo surgery for appendectomy. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on lisinopril, and his diabetes is managed with metformin.

Mr. X has a history of appendicitis, diagnosed 10 years ago, which was managed conservatively with antibiotics. However, he recently developed acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting. CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, and the surgical team recommended an urgent laparoscopic appendectomy.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient has a history of smoking, with a 20 pack-year history. He has attempted quitting several times but has been unsuccessful thus far.

Preoperatively, Mr. X was prepared for surgery with a thorough medical evaluation, including laboratory investigations such as complete blood count, kidney function tests, and coagulation profile, which were found to be within normal limits. His vital signs were stable, and his body mass index was 28, indicating overweight status.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any complications. During the procedure, the appendix was found to be inflamed and gangrenous, confirming the preoperative diagnosis. An uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy was completed successfully.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the recovery room, where his vital signs remained stable. Mr. X was started on analgesics to manage his postoperative pain, and oral intake was initiated once his bowel sounds returned. He tolerated a regular diet without difficulty and passed flatus on postoperative day one.

The patient did not have any immediate postoperative complications, such as wound infection or surgical site bleeding. He was discharged on postoperative day three with appropriate wound care instructions and a prescription for oral analgesics.

On follow-up visit at two weeks post-surgery, Mr. X reported gradual improvement in his pain and a return to normal activities. He did not experience any wound complications, such as dehiscence or seroma formation. His surgical incisions were healing well, and he was pleased with the outcome of the surgery.

In summary, Mr. X, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis. The surgery was successful, with no intraoperative complications noted. In the postoperative period, the patient had an unremarkable recovery, without any wound infections or bleeding. At his two-week follow-up visit, Mr. X was satisfied with the surgical outcome and reported a return to normal activities.
