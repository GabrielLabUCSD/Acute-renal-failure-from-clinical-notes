Patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents to the hospital with the intention of having surgery to address a chronic knee problem. His hypertension has been well controlled on an angiotensin receptor blocker, and his lab results show normal blood pressure readings. The patient also takes a statin medication for his hyperlipidemia, and recent lab work reveals cholesterol and triglyceride levels within the target range.

In terms of diabetes management, the patient is on a combination therapy of metformin and glipizide. His most recent HbA1c measurement was 6.5%, indicating fair glycemic control. The patient reports no episodes of hypoglycemia. Preoperative fasting glucose levels have been consistently around 120 mg/dL.

The patient's past surgical history is significant for an appendectomy in his early 20s and a cholecystectomy in his late 30s. No complications were reported from either surgery. There is no history of any blood transfusions, allergies, or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

Prior to surgery, an EKG was performed, which revealed normal sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave abnormalities. The patient's chest X-ray showed clear lung fields without any signs of infection or significant pathology. Pulmonary function tests indicated a normal forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).

The patient is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or illicit substance use. He states that he exercises regularly, engaging in a combination of cardiovascular exercises and strength training. He denies any recent weight loss or gain, and his body mass index (BMI) is within the normal range.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced mild pain at the surgical site, which was managed with oral analgesics. His vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period, and he did not require any additional interventions such as blood transfusions or supplemental oxygen.

The patient's surgical wound healed well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. He was able to mobilize independently and participate in physical therapy exercises to regain strength and range of motion. The patient's blood glucose levels remained stable in the perioperative period, and his diabetes medication dosages were adjusted accordingly.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course without any complications. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 in a stable condition, with scheduled follow-up appointments. The patient's surgical outcome was successful, and he reported significant improvement in his knee pain and functionality following the surgery.
