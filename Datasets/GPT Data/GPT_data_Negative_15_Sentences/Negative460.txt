The patient is a 65-year-old female who presents with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. She is scheduled to undergo surgery for gallbladder removal due to recurrent biliary colic.

The patient's hypertension has been well-controlled on a combination of amlodipine and lisinopril, with her blood pressure averaging around 130/80 mmHg. Her diabetes is managed with metformin and her last HbA1c was 7.2%. Her hyperlipidemia is treated with atorvastatin, which has resulted in improved lipid levels.

Regarding her surgical preparation, the patient underwent preoperative testing including an EKG, chest x-ray, and laboratory studies. Her results were largely unremarkable, with the exception of slightly elevated liver function tests, likely related to her gallbladder disease. She was cleared for surgery by her primary care physician and an anesthesiologist.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the day before surgery and was started on a clear liquid diet. She received prophylactic antibiotics and was given instructions for fasting prior to surgery. Her surgery was performed laparoscopically and lasted approximately 1 hour without any complications.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room. She was started on oral pain medication and transitioned to a regular diet. Her vital signs remained stable, and she did not experience any significant bleeding or wound infections.

The patient's postoperative course was largely uneventful. She experienced mild surgical site pain for the first few days, which was well-controlled with prescribed pain medication. She was encouraged to ambulate regularly to prevent blood clots and to promote healing.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with appropriate wound care instructions and a prescription for pain medication. She was advised to follow-up with her surgeon in two weeks. The patient attended her follow-up appointment, where she reported continued improvement in her symptoms and satisfactory wound healing.

She did not experience any complications related to her surgery, such as bile leak, retained stones, or wound dehiscence. Her postoperative course was successful, and she returned to her baseline functional status within a week after surgery.

In summary, this 65-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity underwent uneventful laparoscopic gallbladder removal. Her postoperative recovery was smooth, and she did not have any complications following the surgery.
