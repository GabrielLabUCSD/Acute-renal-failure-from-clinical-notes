Patient X is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain. The patient's current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin.

He has had hypertension for the past 10 years, which is well-controlled on lisinopril 20mg daily. There is no history of prior hypertensive crises or target organ damage. Patient X has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 for 15 years and currently manages it with metformin 1000mg twice daily. His most recent hemoglobin A1c level was within the target range.

Regarding his cardiac health, the patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 4 years ago for a significant coronary blockage. His post-PCI course was unremarkable, and he has been on aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol since that time without any cardiac events.

Patient X denies any known drug allergies or adverse reactions. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. There is no history of bleeding disorders or coagulation abnormalities. His prior surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago, without any complications.

In terms of postoperative course, Patient X was initially admitted to the surgical floor after a successful total knee replacement surgery. Vital signs remained stable during his hospital stay, and he received adequate pain management. Physical therapy was initiated the day after surgery, and he made satisfactory progress in achieving mobility milestones.

The patient's initial laboratory results showed mild anemia, which was attributed to the surgery and resolved spontaneously without requiring blood transfusion. His wound healing was uncomplicated, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. Postoperative radiographs confirmed proper alignment of the total knee replacement implant.

Patient X was discharged home on postoperative day 4 with a prescription for oral oxycodone for pain management. He was referred to outpatient physical therapy for continued rehabilitation. The patient was advised to monitor his blood glucose levels closely during the recovery period, given the potential for transient changes in glycemic control.

Throughout the postoperative period, Patient X did not experience any complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. His pain was well-controlled with oral oxycodone, and he was able to gradually weight bear on the operated knee without significant limitations. The patient maintained close follow-up with his primary care physician to optimize his blood pressure and diabetes management.
