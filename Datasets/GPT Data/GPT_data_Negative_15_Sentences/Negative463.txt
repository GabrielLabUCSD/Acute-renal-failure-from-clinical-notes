In the past, the patient has undergone multiple surgeries, including a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and an appendectomy. The surgical outcomes were uneventful, and there were no significant postoperative complications.

During the most recent preoperative evaluation, the patient's complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and renal function tests were within normal limits. Their chest x-ray and EKG were unremarkable. No significant abnormalities were found in their preoperative testing.

Postoperatively, the patient underwent general anesthesia without any complications. They were successfully extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Pain was well-controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The patient was able to tolerate oral intake and ambulated with assistance on the day of surgery.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of wound infection or malnutrition. They were discharged on postoperative day three with appropriate pain management instructions and follow-up appointments scheduled.

During the first postoperative week, the patient experienced mild constipation, likely related to the use of opioids for pain control. This resolved with the initiation of laxatives and increased fluid intake.

The patient was provided with instructions for incision care, activity restrictions, and signs of surgical site infections. They were advised to continue their regular medications and follow up with their primary care physician as scheduled.
