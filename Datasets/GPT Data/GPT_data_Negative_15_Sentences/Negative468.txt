The patient is a 65-year-old female who has been experiencing persistent knee pain and limited mobility. She has a history of osteoarthritis in both knees, which has been managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroid injections.

The patient's surgical history includes a hysterectomy 10 years ago and an appendectomy 25 years ago. She currently takes medications for hypertension, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic. She has no known drug allergies.

Preoperative tests, including a complete blood count, kidney function tests, and liver function tests, were all within normal limits. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no significant abnormalities. The patient was cleared for surgery by her cardiologist and anesthesiologist.

The patient was scheduled for a total knee replacement surgery. She was instructed to stop taking NSAIDs and anticoagulants before the surgery. She was also advised to have nothing to eat or drink after midnight the night before the surgery.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and the arthritic surfaces of the knee joint were removed and replaced with prosthetic components. The procedure was uneventful and lasted approximately two hours.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for signs of bleeding, infection, and pain management. She was given intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and pain medications. Physical therapy was initiated the day after surgery to promote early mobilization and hasten recovery.

The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated. She experienced mild to moderate pain at the incision site, which was managed with oral analgesics. Her vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of infection or excessive bleeding.

She was discharged from the hospital three days after surgery with a prescription for oral pain medication and instructions for at-home care and physical therapy. The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting and high-impact activities for six weeks. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in two weeks to assess wound healing and monitor her progress.

The patient adhered to the postoperative instructions and attended physical therapy sessions regularly. After six weeks, she reported significant improvement in pain and mobility. Her knee function continued to improve over time, and she was able to resume her daily activities without restrictions.

No complications such as wound infections, blood clots, or deep vein thrombosis were observed during the patient's postoperative course. However, as a potential complication of knee replacement surgery, the patient experienced transient urinary retention, which resolved spontaneously within 48 hours without the need for intervention or catheterization.
