The patient is a 52-year-old female who has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol. She has been taking antihypertensive medication and statins for the past five years. She also has a family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly.

Recently, the patient has been experiencing worsening knee pain and has been diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis. She has tried conservative management including physical therapy and pain medications, but they have not provided significant relief.

Due to the severity of her symptoms and the limited mobility she is experiencing, the patient has opted for a total knee replacement surgery. She has been evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon who determined the procedure to be appropriate for her.

Her preoperative evaluation reveals that she has a normal complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemic changes.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy performed in her early twenties and a cesarean section for the delivery of her second child. She did not encounter any complications with these surgeries.

During the total knee replacement surgery, the patient is placed under general anesthesia. The surgeon performs the procedure successfully without any intraoperative complications. The patient is monitored closely during the procedure, and her vital signs remain stable throughout.

Following the surgery, the patient is transferred to the recovery room where she is closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications. She experiences some postoperative pain, which is managed with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics.

The patient is started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any potential infections at the surgical site. She is also encouraged to perform early ambulation and physical therapy to aid in her recovery. The staff ensures that she performs deep breathing exercises regularly to prevent pulmonary complications.

Throughout her postoperative course, the patient does well without any signs of infection, wound complications, or thromboembolic events. She meets all the milestones expected in her recovery, including achieving appropriate range of motion and pain control.

The patient is discharged from the hospital on the fifth day after the surgery. She is provided with appropriate postoperative instructions, including wound care and activities to avoid. She is scheduled for follow-up appointments with the surgeon and physical therapist to monitor her progress.

In summary, this 52-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and high cholesterol underwent a total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. The surgery was uneventful, and she had a smooth postoperative course without any complications. She was discharged home on postoperative day five and will continue outpatient rehabilitation to regain full knee function.
