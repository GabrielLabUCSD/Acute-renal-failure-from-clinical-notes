The patient is a 45-year-old male, with a medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 for the past 10 years. The patient has been on oral hypoglycemic agents to manage his diabetes. He also has a history of smoking for the past 20 years with a 20 pack-year smoking history. He is currently not smoking, but it has been only three months since he quit.

The patient has been experiencing increasing episodes of angina over the past six months, with exertional chest pain and shortness of breath. He has been managed conservatively with medication, including nitrates and beta-blockers.

Due to the persistent angina symptoms, the patient and his healthcare team have decided to proceed with a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient has undergone a thorough preoperative evaluation, including cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, which revealed significant stenosis in multiple coronary arteries.

In addition to his hypertension and diabetes, the patient is also obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35. He has been referred to a nutritionist for weight management counseling prior to surgery.

The patient has been advised to discontinue his oral hypoglycemic agents one day before the surgery and start on insulin therapy for glycemic control. His blood pressure medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, have been continued. He has also been started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor.

The surgery is scheduled for next week, and the patient has been explained the risks and benefits. He understands the importance of postoperative care, including deep breathing exercises, ambulation, and pain management. The patient has provided informed consent for the procedure.

Regarding the postoperative course, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) immediately after the surgery. He was extubated within 12 hours post-surgery and transferred to a surgical ward the next day. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay, and his incision site showed no signs of infection.

The patient's pain was managed with a multi-modal approach including opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). He was encouraged to walk and engage in respiratory exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pneumonia.

The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin therapy was adjusted accordingly to maintain glycemic control. The nutritionist visited regularly to provide dietary guidance and monitor the patient's weight.

The patient was discharged from the hospital five days after the surgery in stable condition. He was advised to continue dual antiplatelet therapy and blood pressure medications. The patient was also referred to cardiac rehabilitation for further exercise and lifestyle modification counseling.

During the postoperative course, the patient did not experience any major complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or wound infection. However, he developed a mild urinary tract infection (UTI) during his hospital stay, which was successfully treated with antibiotics. The patient was advised to drink plenty of fluids and complete the course of antibiotics.
