Patient X is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history. He suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which are well-controlled with medication. Additionally, he has a history of diabetes, which is managed with diet and exercise. The patient has a previous surgical history of a cholecystectomy performed six years ago, with an uneventful recovery.

The patient is now planning to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. He has been experiencing gradual worsening pain and limited mobility in his knee over the past several years, despite conservative management efforts. The decision for surgery was made after extensive discussion of the potential benefits and risks.

In terms of preoperative assessments, the patient has had a thorough evaluation by his primary care physician, including laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. He has been deemed fit for surgery and has provided informed consent.

The surgical procedure was performed without complications, and the patient received general anesthesia. The orthopedic surgeon successfully replaced the patient's knee joint with a prosthetic implant, and the surgery lasted approximately three hours. Intraoperatively, the patient tolerated the procedure well, without any significant hemodynamic instability.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and subsequently to the orthopedic ward. He was started on a regimen of pain control, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, and was closely monitored for any signs of infection or thromboembolic events. Rehabilitation services were initiated within 24 hours after surgery.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and he experienced satisfactory pain control. He actively participated in physical therapy sessions, which focused on joint mobilization and strengthening exercises. His surgical wound showed appropriate healing and was free of signs of infection. Early ambulation was achieved, and the patient was able to perform activities of daily living independently.

A thorough follow-up examination was conducted two weeks after the surgery, during which the patient reported significant improvement in pain and mobility. The orthopedic surgeon noted excellent range of motion in the replaced knee and absence of any signs of inflammation or instability. The patient was advised to continue with rehabilitation exercises at a reputable physical therapy center and to observe proper self-care techniques.

With regard to complications, the patient did not experience any major postoperative complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or postoperative pneumonia. However, he did encounter a minor issue of transient urinary retention as a result of the anesthesia and pain medications, which resolved spontaneously within 48 hours. This was managed with an indwelling urinary catheter until the patient regained proper bladder function. Nonetheless, his overall recovery and outcome were considered successful, and he was discharged home with an appropriate referral for outpatient physical therapy.
