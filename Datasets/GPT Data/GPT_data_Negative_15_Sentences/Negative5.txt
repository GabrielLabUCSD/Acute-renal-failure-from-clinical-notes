Patient X is a 52-year-old male presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 and is currently scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a significant past medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of coronary artery disease for which he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure five years ago. He also has a history of dyslipidemia and is on statin therapy. His blood pressure has been well controlled with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic.

In terms of his renal function, his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been stable around 25 mL/min/1.73mÂ² for the past six months, indicating CKD stage 4. He has not required renal replacement therapy thus far. His recent laboratory results demonstrate mildly elevated serum creatinine levels at 1.6 mg/dL, with a stable serum potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L.

Patient X has been adherent to his diabetic regimen consisting of metformin and glipizide, with a recent hemoglobin A1c of 7.2% indicating fair glycemic control. His lipid profile is within target ranges since initiating statin therapy.

Preoperatively, he underwent a thorough cardiac evaluation including a stress test, which showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. An echocardiogram revealed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. He has been medically optimized for surgery, including appropriate management of his blood pressure and diabetes.

Postoperatively, the patient's course was uneventful, with adequate pain control achieved through a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. He was placed on a prophylactic regimen of low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent venous thromboembolism. In addition, his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications were continued during the postoperative period.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's renal function remained stable. Serial renal panels showed a minimal fluctuation within his baseline values. He did not develop any complications such as acute kidney injury or electrolyte imbalances. His surgical wound also healed without any signs of infection or dehiscence, and his ambulation was encouraged early to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient was monitored closely for signs of postoperative delirium, but no such effects were observed. His pain was managed effectively, and he was able to resume a regular diet within 24 hours of the surgery. He was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate follow-up scheduled with his primary care physician, cardiologist, and nephrologist for continued management.

Overall, Patient X experienced a successful perioperative period with no postoperative complications.
