The patient is a 72-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. He is planning to undergo an elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe joint pain and limited mobility. The patient has been managed conservatively with physical therapy, pain medications, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the past year but has not achieved significant improvement.

His current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and meloxicam. His blood pressure has been relatively well-controlled with an average reading of 130/80 mmHg. The patient's blood glucose has been stable with an HbA1c of 6.7%. He has a history of occasional hypoglycemic episodes, but these episodes have been well managed with diet and adjustments in his diabetes medications.

Further assessment reveals the patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 31, indicating he is overweight. He has a sedentary lifestyle and reports difficulty with weight loss due to limited physical activity.

His preoperative laboratory workup is unremarkable, with normal complete blood count, renal function panel, and liver function tests. His urine analysis shows no evidence of urinary tract infection.

The patient has been educated about the surgical procedure and the associated risks, including but not limited to bleeding, infection, postoperative pain, and scarring. He understands the importance of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to minimize the risk of complications.

Postoperatively, the patient is monitored closely for signs of infection, such as fever, wound drainage, or increased pain. He undergoes physical therapy to promote early mobilization and is managed with opioid and non-opioid pain medications. The patient follows a structured rehabilitation plan to regain strength and improve joint mobility.

During his postoperative course, the patient experiences a minor wound infection, which is managed conservatively with local wound care and a course of oral antibiotics. The infection resolves within two weeks, and the patient continues with outpatient physical therapy.

Overall, the patient's postoperative recovery is satisfactory, and he achieves significant improvement in his joint pain and mobility. No other complications, such as pulmonary embolism or wound dehiscence, are noted. The patient's postoperative course is unremarkable despite the minor wound infection, and he is discharged home with appropriate follow-up appointments and instructions for continued rehabilitation.
