The patient is a 55-year-old male, with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. He presented with complaints of severe knee pain due to osteoarthritis, which has significantly limited his mobility and quality of life. The pain has been refractory to conservative management, including physical therapy and analgesic medications.

The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension, managed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). His blood pressure has been consistently within the target range of less than 130/80 mmHg. He has no other cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease or heart failure.

His diabetes mellitus type 2 is also well-controlled with oral medications, including metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. His most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 6.5%, demonstrating good glycemic control. He has no history of diabetic complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy.

The patient's body mass index (BMI) is 35, indicating obesity. He has attempted various weight loss programs, but has been unsuccessful in achieving sustained weight loss. He does not have a history of obstructive sleep apnea or other obesity-related conditions.

In preparation for surgery, an orthopedic evaluation was conducted, confirming the diagnosis of severe osteoarthritis in the left knee, with associated joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. Preoperative imaging confirmed the extent of cartilage damage and ruled out any significant ligamentous injuries.

The patient received education regarding the surgical procedure, including risks and benefits, and the potential for a prolonged recovery period. He expressed a realistic understanding of the postoperative rehabilitation process and has committed to actively participating in physical therapy to optimize outcomes.

The surgery took place without any intraoperative complications or adverse events. The patient tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia, without any hemodynamic instability or difficulties with respiratory management.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely for pain control, infection, and potential complications related to wound healing. He received both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for pain management, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy modalities.

During the postoperative period, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not require additional blood pressure medications. His glycemic control was maintained within the target range, with adjustments made to his antidiabetic medications to account for the surgical stress.

The patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course, with adequate pain control and early initiation of physical therapy exercises. He demonstrated progress in his mobility and joint range of motion during scheduled follow-up visits.

He did not develop any postoperative complications, such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. His surgical incision healed well, without signs of delayed wound healing or dehiscence.

Overall, the patient's surgical procedure was successful, and he achieved the desired outcome of improved knee functionality and pain relief. He was discharged to home with a comprehensive discharge plan, including instructions for continued physical therapy and gradual return to daily activities.
