He is currently on antihypertensive medication and takes a statin for his high cholesterol level. He also manages his diabetes with oral medication. Mr. Smith has a history of smoking, although he quit five years ago. He denies any significant family history of cardiovascular or surgical complications.

Mr. Smith is scheduled to undergo surgery to remove a benign tumor in his colon. He underwent a detailed preoperative evaluation, including laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and an electrocardiogram. His blood tests revealed well-controlled diabetes and lipid levels within the targeted range. Chest X-ray showed no signs of any pulmonary pathology, and the electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of prior cardiac injury.

On the day of surgery, Mr. Smith received general anesthesia and experienced an uneventful procedure. The surgeon successfully removed the tumor without complications. Postoperatively, Mr. Smith was transferred to the recovery room, where he was closely monitored for vital signs, pain, and any signs of surgical site infection. He received opioids for pain management and was encouraged to ambulate and practice deep breathing exercises to prevent respiratory complications.

Mr. Smith remained in the hospital for four days to recover. During his stay, he experienced some postoperative ileus, which is a temporary delay in bowel function after surgery. He was managed conservatively with bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and antiemetics, which successfully resolved the issue. However, he did not exhibit any other complications following surgery such as infection, bleeding, or deep vein thrombosis.

As part of his recovery plan, Mr. Smith was provided with a detailed postoperative care plan that involved adhering to a clear liquid diet initially and gradually transitioning to a regular diet. He was instructed to take prescribed pain medication as needed and encouraged to walk every day to promote mobility. Mr. Smith was also advised to follow up with his surgeon in two weeks to ensure proper healing and discuss any concerns.

Overall, Mr. Smith's surgery went well without any acute complications. He experienced temporary postoperative ileus, which was successfully managed. His overall prognosis is favorable, and with proper postoperative care, he is expected to have a smooth recovery.
