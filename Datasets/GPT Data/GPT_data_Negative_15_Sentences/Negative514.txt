Prior to surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, including blood work to assess his liver and kidney function. All results were within normal limits. ECG and chest x-ray were also performed, which showed no abnormalities. Additionally, the patient met with an anesthesiologist to discuss anesthesia options and evaluate his fitness for the procedure.

The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the recovery room.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild pain at the incision sites, which was managed with analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate and was started on a clear liquid diet. His vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of postoperative infection or bleeding. The patient was closely monitored by the nursing staff.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home three days after the surgery. He was instructed to continue his regular medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia and given a prescription for pain medication to manage any residual discomfort. In addition, the patient was advised to follow a low-fat diet and gradually increase his activity level.

There were no immediate complications following the surgery, such as wound infection or bleeding. The patient reported no postoperative complications during his follow-up appointments. He stated that his abdominal pain had completely resolved, and he had no further episodes of nausea or vomiting. The incision sites were healing well without signs of infection, and the patient had resumed his normal activities without any restrictions.

Overall, the patient's surgery to remove his gallbladder was successful, and his postoperative course was uneventful. He did not experience any complications related to the procedure. The patient is satisfied with the outcome and has reported improved quality of life since undergoing the surgery.
