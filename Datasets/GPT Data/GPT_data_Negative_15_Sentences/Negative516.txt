The patient is a 45-year-old male who has decided to undergo surgery and has no known drug allergies. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a prior myocardial infarction. His blood pressure is controlled with lisinopril and amlodipine, and he takes atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia. His diabetes is managed with metformin and canagliflozin. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for his myocardial infarction, and he currently has one drug-eluting stent in his left anterior descending artery.

The patient reports no recent chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. He has no evidence of cardiac dysfunction on recent echocardiogram. His preoperative laboratory tests include a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and coagulation studies, which are all within normal limits. His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is 7.5%, indicating fair glycemic control.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has had an appendectomy in the past and reports no complications from that procedure. His preoperative imaging studies include a chest X-ray and an abdominal ultrasound, both of which are unremarkable. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The patient's surgery is scheduled for next week, and the surgical team has performed a thorough preoperative evaluation. The patient has been instructed to discontinue his metformin and canagliflozin two days prior to surgery to minimize the risk of intraoperative hypoglycemia and dehydration. He has been advised to follow a clear liquid diet the day before surgery and nothing by mouth after midnight on the day of the procedure.

Following the surgery, the patient has an uneventful postoperative course. He is closely monitored in the recovery room and his vital signs remain stable. The patient is able to tolerate clear liquids and advance to a regular diet on the first postoperative day. He is also encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient is discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day, with instructions to continue his lisinopril, amlodipine, atorvastatin, metformin, and canagliflozin. He is also prescribed a short course of low molecular weight heparin to prevent venous thromboembolism. The patient is advised to rest at home and avoid any strenuous activities for the next two weeks.

There are no immediate complications reported during the patient's postoperative course. He does not experience any significant pain, fever, or wound issues. He has a follow-up appointment scheduled in two weeks to assess his surgical incision and ensure proper healing.

Overall, the patient's surgery and postoperative recovery went smoothly without any complications, demonstrating satisfactory medical management and appropriate perioperative care planning.
