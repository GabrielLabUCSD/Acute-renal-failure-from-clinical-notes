The patient is a 65-year-old female who presents with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. She has been on a combination of antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years and statins for her hyperlipidemia. She reports occasional knee pain that has been managed conservatively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The patient is currently scheduled for a total knee replacement surgery due to worsening osteoarthritis symptoms. She has discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with her orthopedic surgeon and will be undergoing general anesthesia.

Her preoperative workup includes a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and a chest X-ray. All these investigations are within normal limits except for a mild elevation in her LDL cholesterol levels.

The patient has no known drug allergies but does express concern about postoperative pain management. The anesthesiologist and surgeon discuss the multimodal approach to pain management, which will include a combination of opioids, non-opioids, and regional nerve blocks.

During the surgery, the patient is hemodynamically stable, with no intraoperative complications reported. Postoperatively, she is seen in the recovery unit, where her vital signs are stable, and she is initiated on deep breathing exercises and physical therapy.

The patient's pain is well controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia pump that delivers a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She is also started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

In the following days, the patient experiences some postoperative swelling and limited range of motion in the knee joint, which is expected after such a procedure. Physical therapy is continued, and she is discharged home on postoperative day three with a prescription for oral pain medication.

Her recovery at home is uneventful, and she is able to gradually increase her activity level and range of motion. She follows up with her orthopedic surgeon at two weeks and reports significant improvement in pain and mobility.

There are no documented complications during the patient's postoperative course. She is advised to continue her regular antihypertensive and statin medications and is encouraged to maintain an active lifestyle to optimize the outcomes of her knee replacement surgery.
