The patient, a 55-year-old male, has a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years, which have helped maintain his blood pressure within the normal range. His diabetes is well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, and his last HbA1c level was 6.7%. He takes statins for his hyperlipidemia, with his most recent lipid panel showing LDL cholesterol levels within target range.

The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, indicating obesity. He has been advised to lose weight and has attempted various diets in the past without much success. His prior surgeries include a cholecystectomy 8 years ago for symptomatic gallstones and an appendectomy during his childhood.

During preoperative assessment, routine laboratory investigations such as a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, liver function tests, and coagulation profile were within normal limits. His renal function was evaluated, and serum creatinine levels were found to be 1.2 mg/dL, indicating normal kidney function.

Postoperatively, the patient was initially recovering well. He received appropriate pain management and started ambulating the day after surgery. The surgical incision appeared clean and dry, without signs of infection. He was closely monitored for signs of complications, including infection, thrombosis, and respiratory distress. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications.

However, on the third postoperative day, the patient developed a fever of 101Â°F and complained of increased pain at the surgical site. Blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count, and wound cultures were obtained. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, pending the culture results. The wound culture later revealed Staphylococcus aureus, and the antibiotics were adjusted accordingly. The patient responded well to treatment, and his fever subsided within 48 hours. Regular wound care and monitoring of the surgical site were continued until the wound healed completely.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's renal function remained stable, with no evidence of acute renal failure. His blood pressure was carefully monitored, and there were no significant fluctuations. The patient was discharged home after 5 days without any further complications. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine postoperative care and to continue his antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications. The patient was also referred to a nutritionist to develop a comprehensive weight management plan to address his obesity.
