The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo elective surgery. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and Type 2 diabetes, which are well-controlled with medications. He has a family history of heart disease, but he is not currently experiencing any cardiac symptoms.

The patient has a history of smoking, with a 20-pack year smoking history, but he quit smoking five years ago. He does not have any known allergies to medications or latex. His preoperative laboratory tests, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, are all within normal limits.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy ten years ago and an inguinal hernia repair five years ago. Both surgeries were uncomplicated, and the patient had a smooth recovery.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination was unremarkable, and he had no focal neurological deficits.

An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities. His chest X-ray and echocardiogram were also normal. The patient has been cleared for surgery by the anesthesiologist after a thorough preoperative examination and evaluation.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. He was provided with analgesics to manage pain and encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He tolerated oral intake well and his urine output remained within normal limits.

The patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications such as bleeding, infection, or wound dehiscence. His vital signs remained stable, and he was discharged home on the third postoperative day, as per the surgical team's protocol.

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reported minimal pain and good overall recovery. He did not develop any postoperative infections or wound complications. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable, and he continued to take his prescribed medications as instructed.

In conclusion, the patient's history of hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and past surgical procedures were significant factors considered during the preoperative evaluation. However, the surgery was performed without any complications, and the patient had a smooth postoperative course with an uneventful recovery.
