The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has been on antihypertensive medication for 5 years and manages his diabetes with oral hypoglycemic medications. The patient also has a history of smoking for 20 years but reports quitting smoking 2 years ago.

The patient is scheduled to have surgery due to a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. He has been experiencing persistent back pain radiating down his left leg for the past 6 months, which has been unresponsive to conservative management. The patient's preoperative imaging studies, including an MRI, confirm the presence of a herniated disc at the L4-L5 level.

During the preoperative evaluations, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, and his laboratory tests, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, were unremarkable. The patient is not currently taking any anticoagulant medications or other blood thinners.

The patient will undergo a laminectomy and microdiscectomy to decompress the nerve root being compressed by the herniated disc. The surgery will be done under general anesthesia. The patient has been informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure and has provided informed consent.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored for pain, wound healing, and neurologic function. He will be started on intravenous antibiotics prophylactically to prevent surgical site infections. The patient will also receive deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in the form of subcutaneous heparin.

Pain management will involve the use of intravenous analgesics initially, followed by oral pain medications as tolerated. Physical therapy will be initiated to help the patient regain mobility and prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to be uneventful, with gradual improvement in his back pain and resolution of the radicular symptoms over the next few weeks. However, the patient may experience some postoperative pain, swelling, and bruising at the surgical site.

Complications that can occur after this surgery include surgical site infection, hematoma formation, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and persistent or recurrent back pain. It is important for the patient to adhere to postoperative instructions, including proper wound care and activity limitations, to minimize the risk of complications.

The patient did not experience any complications during his postoperative course. His pain was well controlled with medications, and physical therapy helped him regain strength and mobility. The patient was able to return to his normal activities after 6 weeks, and his back pain and radicular symptoms completely resolved.
