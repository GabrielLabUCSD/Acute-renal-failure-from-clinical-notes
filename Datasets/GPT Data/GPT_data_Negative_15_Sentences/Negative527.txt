The patient is a 60-year-old male who presents with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. The patient has been on medications for his hypertension, including lisinopril and metoprolol, both of which are well controlled. For his hyperlipidemia, he takes atorvastatin and reports good compliance. His diabetes is managed with metformin, and his hemoglobin A1c levels have been consistently below 7%. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, having undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention one year ago. His current medications include dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor.

In terms of smoking history, the patient reports being an ex-smoker, having quit five years ago. He denies any current alcohol or illicit drug use. The patient has no known drug allergies.

On physical examination, he is found to be well-nourished and in no acute distress. His vital signs are stable, with normal blood pressure readings. Cardiac examination reveals no murmurs, and the lungs are clear to auscultation. The surgical consultation notes that the patient's general health is optimal for surgery, and he has been cleared for the procedure by cardiology and endocrinology.

The patient undergoes surgery without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he is initially placed on a patient-controlled analgesia pump for pain control, which is later transitioned to oral opioids. The patient is closely monitored for any signs of postoperative infection, and prophylactic antibiotics are administered per protocol. His wound heals well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence noted. The patient's pain is adequately managed, and he reports good overall postoperative recovery.

During the hospital stay, the patient develops a transient episode of atrial fibrillation, likely secondary to postoperative stress; however, no intervention is required as he spontaneously converts back to sinus rhythm. His vital signs remain stable throughout his hospital course. The patient's postoperative laboratory evaluation shows no evidence of acute renal failure or electrolyte imbalances. He is discharged home on postoperative day five with appropriate discharge instructions and a plan for close follow-up with his primary care physician.

In summary, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease who underwent surgery for a hernia repair. His medical conditions were well controlled with medications prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery, with no acute complications observed. No acute renal failure was noted during his hospital course. He was discharged home in stable condition, with plans for close outpatient follow-up.
