The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been taking medications for these conditions, including an ACE inhibitor, a statin, and an oral hypoglycemic agent. The patient has a BMI of 35 and is a smoker, with a 20-pack-year history.

His surgical history includes a cholecystectomy six years ago and an appendectomy during childhood. The patient is currently planning to undergo an elective total knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis. Preoperative laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL, a platelet count of 200,000/mm3, and a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

During the postoperative course, the patient developed a mild surgical site infection, which was managed with wound care and a short course of oral antibiotics. He also experienced moderate postoperative pain, for which he was given a combination of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet and maintain adequate oral intake. He ambulated with a physical therapist on the second postoperative day.

No postoperative complications were noted, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 with a prescription for oral analgesics and instructions on wound care. He was advised to continue his regular medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. The patient was referred to physical therapy for further rehabilitation of his knee.

During the first follow-up visit two weeks after surgery, the surgical wound was healing well, and the patient reported a significant reduction in pain. Physical examination revealed improved range of motion in the affected knee. The patient was scheduled for additional physical therapy sessions and instructed to continue his home exercises.

At the one-month follow-up visit, the patient reported continued improvement in pain and function. The surgical wound had completely healed, and the knee replacement was functioning well. The patient was advised to gradually increase his activity level and return to his normal daily routines. He was scheduled for a follow-up visit in six months to monitor his progress.
