Patient A is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been managed on antihypertensive medications, statins, and oral hypoglycemic agents for the past 10 years. The patient smokes approximately half a pack of cigarettes daily and reports occasional alcohol consumption.

He is now planning to undergo surgery to address symptomatic osteoarthritis of the right knee. His preoperative laboratory workup showed a fasting blood glucose of 150 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.2%. Renal function tests revealed a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, consistent with normal kidney function. His blood pressure was well controlled at 130/80 mmHg. The patient weighs 200 pounds and is 5 feet 10 inches tall, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 28.7 kg/m^2.

During the preoperative discussion, the patient was counseled about the risks of surgery and the importance of glycemic control during the perioperative period. He was advised to discontinue smoking and alcohol consumption for at least four weeks prior to the surgery. The patient agreed and was referred to a smoking cessation program.

Following the surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He received multimodal analgesia and prophylactic antibiotics according to the hospital's guidelines. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored and managed with a sliding scale insulin regimen. Physical therapy was initiated on the second day after surgery, aiming to improve joint range of motion and strength. The patient complied well with the therapy sessions.

The patient's surgical wound healed with no signs of infection or delayed healing. His blood glucose levels remained within the target range, and his HbA1c was rechecked two weeks postoperatively, showing a improvement to 7.5%. The patient did not experience any acute kidney injury or other major postoperative complications.

In conclusion, this 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus successfully underwent surgery for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the right knee. He had a smooth postoperative course with no acute renal failure or major complications. The patient demonstrated good compliance with lifestyle modifications and glycemic control, which contributed to his positive outcome.
