The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital for surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history. His current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, simvastatin, metformin, and albuterol inhaler as needed.

The patient initially presented with worsening symptoms related to his COPD, including increased dyspnea on exertion and wheezing. He had been experiencing these symptoms for the past few months, and they had recently worsened, prompting his decision to undergo surgery for a lobectomy due to suspicious lung nodules seen on a recent CT scan.

His preoperative workup included a chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, and a cardiac stress test, which were all within normal limits. His bloodwork showed well-controlled diabetes and stable renal function. There were no signs of active infection or other comorbidities that would contraindicate surgery.

The patient underwent the scheduled lobectomy under general anesthesia without complications. In the immediate postoperative period, he was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and received routine postoperative care, including pain management and respiratory support.

His postoperative course was uneventful, and he gradually improved over the following days. He was weaned off supplemental oxygen and started on respiratory therapy to aid in his recovery. Chest X-rays taken after the surgery showed no signs of postoperative complications such as pneumothorax or consolidation.

The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet on the second postoperative day and was discharged from the hospital on the fifth day after surgery. He was given instructions for wound care and advised to follow up with his primary care physician and pulmonologist. The pathology report confirmed the presence of lung cancer, but with clear surgical margins.

During the follow-up visit with his primary care physician three weeks later, the patient reported no significant concerns or complications. He was referred to an oncologist to discuss further treatment options, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful. He recovered well from the surgery without any immediate complications and was able to resume his regular activities with appropriate follow-up care and a referral for further treatment.
