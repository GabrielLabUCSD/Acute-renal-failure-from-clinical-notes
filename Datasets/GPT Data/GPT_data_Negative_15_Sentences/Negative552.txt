Patient X is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He has a history of myocardial infarction and has undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery five years ago. The patient is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history.

He is currently scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a total hip replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. His hip pain has been worsening over the past year, limiting his mobility and causing difficulty with activities of daily living.

In preparation for surgery, the patient has undergone routine preoperative assessments, including laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and an electrocardiogram, which were all within normal limits. He has been counseled on the potential risks and benefits of the surgery, including the possibility of postoperative complications.

During his hospitalization, Patient X received intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis prior to the surgery to prevent surgical site infections. Anesthesia was administered smoothly, and the surgical team successfully performed the total hip replacement without any intraoperative complications.

Following the surgery, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for the initial 24 hours. He had adequate pain control with a patient-controlled analgesia pump. Physical therapy was initiated on postoperative day one to promote early mobilization, and the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of a walker.

Throughout his hospital stay, Patient X's vital signs remained stable, with no signs of infection or wound complications. Blood glucose levels were well-controlled with insulin therapy, and he did not experience any diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he demonstrated gradual improvement in mobility and pain control. On the third day after surgery, he was transferred to a dedicated rehabilitation facility for continued physical therapy and rehabilitation.

Patient X did not experience any immediate postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or wound dehiscence. However, due to his history of cardiovascular disease, he remained on antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, which required careful monitoring throughout his hospital stay.

In summary, Patient X, a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, successfully underwent elective total hip replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for further recovery and physical therapy. He did not experience any complications during his hospitalization, besides being on anticoagulant therapy due to his cardiovascular history.
