The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a significant medical history. He has been diagnosed with hypertension for 10 years and is currently on a regular medication regimen to control his blood pressure. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, which he manages with oral hypoglycemic agents. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and underwent coronary artery bypass surgery at that time. His cardiac function is currently stable, and his most recent echocardiogram showed a preserved ejection fraction of 60%.

In addition to his cardiovascular issues, the patient also has osteoarthritis in both knees. He has been experiencing significant pain and limited mobility, which has negatively impacted his quality of life. Despite conservative management with physical therapy and pain medications, the patient's symptoms have persisted, leading him to consider surgical intervention. The patient has undergone a series of noninvasive treatments, including corticosteroid injections and viscosupplementation, without significant improvement.

The patient has been evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon who recommends a total knee replacement for both knees. Preoperative laboratory testing, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, has been completed and found to be within normal limits. An electrocardiogram and a stress test were also performed, both showing no evidence of myocardial ischemia.

The patient has been cleared by both his cardiologist and endocrinologist, with appropriate medication adjustments made to optimize his perioperative care. Preoperative education and counseling have been provided, including information on the expected postoperative course and potential complications associated with the surgery.

The patient underwent bilateral total knee replacement surgeries without complications. He was carefully monitored throughout the perioperative period, including close surveillance of his blood pressure and blood glucose levels. The patient received appropriate deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative pain management.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild to moderate pain, which was effectively managed with a multimodal approach including opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not develop any signs of infection or wound complications. The patient was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist on the day of surgery, and his range of motion gradually improved over the subsequent days.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 with a prescription for oral pain medications and instructions for postoperative care at home. The patient was advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient to maximize his functional recovery.

To date, the patient has not experienced any postoperative complications. He has been compliant with his medication regimen and has been monitoring his blood pressure and blood glucose levels regularly. The patient has been diligent with his postoperative physical therapy and has made steady progress in regaining his mobility.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience, postoperative course, and recovery have been successful. He is satisfied with the outcome of his knee replacement surgeries and has noticed significant improvement in his pain and mobility. The patient will continue to follow up with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon for routine postoperative visits to ensure his continued progress and well-being.
