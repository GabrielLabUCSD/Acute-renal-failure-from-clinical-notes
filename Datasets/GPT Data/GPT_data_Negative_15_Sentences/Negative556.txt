Patient X is a 60-year-old male planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and osteoarthritis. He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and is currently on amlodipine 5 mg once daily for blood pressure control. His diabetes was diagnosed 5 years ago, and he takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily for glycemic control. His hyperlipidemia is managed with atorvastatin 20 mg once daily.

Patient X has a history of smoking, consuming approximately 10 cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. His COPD has been well-controlled with inhalers, including albuterol and fluticasone-salmeterol. He experiences occasional exacerbations, usually triggered by respiratory infections, and has required short courses of oral corticosteroids in the past.

Additionally, Patient X has osteoarthritis affecting his knees, and he experiences occasional knee pain that is managed with NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. This condition limits his mobility and daily activities to some extent.

Before surgery, Patient X underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. His blood pressure was well-controlled, and his diabetes was stable. All other laboratory results were within normal limits. His cardiac evaluation revealed no significant concerning findings, and his pulmonary function tests indicated mild airflow obstruction consistent with his COPD diagnosis.

During the surgery, Patient X was placed under general anesthesia, and the hernia repair was performed successfully without any complications. The duration of the surgery was approximately 1 hour.

In the immediate postoperative period, Patient X was closely monitored in the recovery room. He was given adequate pain management, including analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications, which helped keep his pain levels under control. Additionally, he received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

Patient X's postoperative course was uneventful, and he showed good recovery. He had no signs of wound infections, and his pain gradually decreased over the next few days. The surgical team ensured frequent ambulation to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. Physical therapy sessions were initiated to aid in the restoration of his mobility.

Patient X remained in the hospital for 2 more days for close observation, during which time he received continued wound care and monitoring of his vital signs. He was discharged home with oral pain medication, specific instructions for wound care, and follow-up appointments with both his primary care physician and the surgeon.

Fortunately, Patient X did not experience any complications in the postoperative period other than transient nausea and constipation, which were managed with appropriate medications. His surgical wound healed well, and he did not require any further interventions or readmissions.
