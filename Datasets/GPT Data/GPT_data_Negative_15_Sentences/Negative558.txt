This is a summary of a patient's medical history prior to surgery, as well as their postoperative course and any complications that occurred. However, acute renal failure is excluded as a complication.

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis. He had tried conservative management options such as pain medications and physical therapy, but his symptoms persisted. After discussing the benefits and risks, the patient decided to undergo knee replacement surgery.

His past medical history is significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with medications. He also has a history of tobacco use but quit smoking five years ago. The patient has no known drug allergies. His family history is unremarkable for any significant medical conditions.

Prior to the surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation. Blood work, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, was obtained and found to be within normal limits. His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities. Chest X-ray revealed no evidence of pulmonary pathology.

The patient was counseled on the procedure, including the risks of infection, pain, bleeding, and the possibility of deep vein thrombosis. He was given instructions on preoperative fasting and cessation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications as necessary.

The knee replacement surgery was conducted by an experienced orthopedic surgeon. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no intraoperative complications reported. Postoperatively, he was monitored closely for vital signs, pain control, and the prevention of deep vein thrombosis.

The patient received prophylactic antibiotics postoperatively to prevent surgical site infections. Physical therapy was promptly initiated to promote joint mobility and strength. His pain was well managed with a combination of oral analgesics and epidural anesthesia.

Throughout his postoperative course, the patient demonstrated steady progress in his rehabilitation efforts. He worked closely with the physical therapy team and gradually regained strength and mobility in his knee joint. The surgical wound showed no signs of infection or dehiscence.

At the one-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported mild swelling and discomfort in the surgical area, which is expected after this type of surgery. However, he did not exhibit any signs or symptoms concerning for infection, such as fever or purulent drainage.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he achieved significant improvement in his quality of life following knee replacement surgery. He did not experience complications such as surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, or wound healing issues. However, acute renal failure was not reported, which may be attributed to the exclusion criteria.
