The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient had a myocardial infarction three years ago, but he has since undergone cardiovascular clearance and is currently stable. He has a history of smoking, but he quit two months ago. 

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy 10 years ago and a cholecystectomy five years ago. He had an uneventful recovery from both procedures. The patient is not currently taking any medications, but he was previously on metoprolol for his blood pressure and metformin for diabetes control. He stopped taking these medications upon the advice of his surgeon.

During the preoperative workup, the patient underwent a routine physical examination and laboratory tests. His blood pressure was well controlled, and his blood glucose levels were within normal limits. His pulmonary function tests indicated mild airflow limitation consistent with his COPD diagnosis, but he did not require supplemental oxygen.

The patient was seen by an anesthesiologist, who determined that he was an appropriate candidate for general anesthesia. It was noted that the patient had an elevated body mass index (BMI) of 32, but this was not considered a contraindication for surgery. 

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the surgical ward. He was started on a clear liquid diet, which was advanced as tolerated. The patient's pain was well controlled with oral analgesics, and he did not require any intravenous pain medications. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications related to the surgery. He was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day with specific instructions for wound care and follow-up appointments.

In conclusion, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, COPD, and a prior myocardial infarction, who is planning to undergo hernia repair surgery. His preoperative workup was unremarkable, and he was deemed a suitable candidate for general anesthesia. He had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged with appropriate instructions.
