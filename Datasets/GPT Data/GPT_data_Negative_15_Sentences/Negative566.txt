The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and coronary artery disease. He presents to the hospital with the plan to undergo surgery for the removal of a suspicious mass in his lung. The patient's preoperative evaluation reveals stable vital signs, normal laboratory results, and a good functional status.

In the past, he had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery five years ago. He had an uneventful recovery from that procedure and has been compliant with his medications, which include aspirin, a beta blocker, and a statin. His blood pressure is well-controlled with amlodipine.

The patient denies any recent respiratory symptoms, such as cough, hemoptysis, or dyspnea. He also has no history of prior lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. His lung function tests, including spirometry, show normal values.

On physical examination, the patient is in no acute distress, with clear lung sounds bilaterally and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated on cardiac auscultation. His chest X-ray reveals a small solitary nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung.

The patient's surgery is scheduled under general anesthesia, and he is provided with appropriate preoperative counseling regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure. The patient understands the procedure and provides informed consent.

During the surgery, the mass is successfully removed with clear margins, and the patient tolerates the procedure well. His postoperative course is unremarkable, with stable vital signs and minimal pain.

The patient is started on postoperative deep breathing exercises and incentive spirometry to prevent pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia. He is also given prophylactic low molecular weight heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

In the following days, the patient gradually recovers well, with resolution of postoperative pain, return of normal bowel function, and good oral intake. He is able to ambulate independently and is discharged home on postoperative day five.

No complications such as wound infections, wound dehiscence, or intraoperative bleeding are noted during the patient's hospital stay. He is given a follow-up appointment for suture removal and pathology review of the excised mass.
