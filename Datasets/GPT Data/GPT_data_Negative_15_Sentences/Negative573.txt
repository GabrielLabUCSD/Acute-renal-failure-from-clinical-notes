The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently being managed with lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin for these conditions. The patient reports stable control of his blood pressure and blood glucose levels.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient has a past surgical history significant for a cholecystectomy three years ago without any postoperative complications. He also underwent a knee arthroscopy five years ago for meniscal repair with an uneventful recovery.

The patient is now scheduled for a hernia repair surgery due to the recent development of a large inguinal hernia. He reports intermittent pain and discomfort at the hernia site, but denies any signs of strangulation or bowel obstruction. The surgical team has performed a thorough preoperative evaluation, including laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and a chest x-ray, which all came back within normal limits.

The patient has been advised to hold his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the morning of the surgery and to continue fasting from midnight prior to the procedure. He has been instructed to bring his medications to the hospital, where they will be resumed postoperatively after ensuring adequate pain control.

Following the hernia repair surgery, the patient's immediate postoperative course was unremarkable. He woke up from anesthesia without any complications and was later transferred to the surgical ward. The nursing staff closely monitored his vital signs and surgical site for any signs of infection. Pain control was effectively managed with intravenous opioids, and his blood pressure and glucose levels remained stable throughout.

The patient was started on clear liquids 6 hours postoperatively and was transitioned to a regular diet the next day without any reported issues. He ambulated with assistance on the first postoperative day and became increasingly independent with activities of daily living.

No postoperative complications were noted during the patient's hospital stay. He did not develop any signs of surgical site infection, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis. Wound healing progressed well, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate wound care instructions.

During the follow-up appointment one week post-discharge, the surgical site appeared healthy and sutures were intact. The patient did not report any fevers, chills, or other symptoms suggestive of an infection. He was advised to gradually resume his regular activities and to continue taking his medications as prescribed.

In conclusion, this patient had a successful hernia repair surgery without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. The surgical wound healed well, and the patient's recovery was uneventful. He will continue to be followed-up for routine postoperative care.
