Patient XYZ, a 65-year-old male, is presenting for surgery. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension for the past 10 years, which is controlled with medication. He also has a history of dyslipidemia for the past 5 years, well managed with statin therapy. The patient previously underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery 7 years ago due to severe coronary artery disease.

Additionally, the patient has a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years, managed with oral antidiabetic medications. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating obesity. The patient is an ex-smoker, having quit smoking 10 years ago.

In regards to his surgical history, apart from coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the patient has had a cholecystectomy performed 2 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. He had an uneventful recovery from that surgery. There is no known family history of any significant medical conditions.

In preparation for the upcoming surgery, the patient's preoperative tests revealed normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function, with a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's electrocardiogram showed no significant abnormalities, and his echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular function. The patient was classified as ASA-III (moderate systemic disease).

Immediately following surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring. The postoperative course was unremarkable, with stable vital signs and no significant pain, bleeding, or infection at the surgical site. The patient was able to tolerate oral intake and ambulate without difficulty.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence, surgical site infection, or respiratory distress. However, the patient did develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) on the 3rd postoperative day, which was successfully treated with antibiotic therapy and did not require further interventions. The patient continued to recover well and was discharged home on the 7th postoperative day with appropriate follow-up instructions.
