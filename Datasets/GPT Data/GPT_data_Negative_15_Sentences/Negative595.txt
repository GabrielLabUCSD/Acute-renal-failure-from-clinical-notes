Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who has been scheduled for surgery. He has a significant medical history, which includes hypothyroidism, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. His medications include levothyroxine, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin.

The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating obesity. He is a former smoker, having quit five years ago, but has a significant smoking history of 20 pack-years. He does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy ten years ago without any complications. He has no documented allergies to medications or materials used in surgery.

Laboratory results indicate a well-controlled blood glucose level, but his lipid profile shows elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. His kidney function is within normal limits, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73m2.

The patient is scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation has been conducted, including chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and complete blood count, which were all within normal limits. The patient has consented to the procedure and is well-informed about the risks and benefits.

Following the surgery, the patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. He was monitored closely for any signs of complications, such as infection, bleeding, or thrombosis, but none were observed. He received appropriate postoperative pain management and was closely monitored for wound healing.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period, and he did not require any additional interventions. He was discharged from the hospital after an uneventful recovery. Postoperative instructions were provided, emphasizing the importance of following a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet.

No complications, including acute renal failure, were observed during the patient's postoperative course. However, close monitoring of renal function was advised due to the patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, which can contribute to renal impairment. Further follow-up is recommended to ensure optimal management of his chronic conditions post-surgery.
