The patient is a 52-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been managed on lisinopril for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for his dyslipidemia, and metformin for his diabetes. His hypertension has been well controlled with blood pressure consistently less than 130/80 mmHg. He has no history of previous surgeries or anesthesia complications.

The patient's diabetes has been relatively well-controlled with a HbA1c of 7% on metformin alone. However, his fasting blood glucose levels have occasionally been elevated above 180 mg/dL. He regularly monitors his blood glucose at home. His last lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL, triglycerides of 150 mg/dL, HDL of 40 mg/dL, and LDL of 100 mg/dL.

His preoperative evaluation reveals a body mass index (BMI) of 29.8 kg/m², within the overweight range but not obese. His physical examination is unremarkable except for the hernia. Laboratory investigations include a hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, platelet count of 200,000/μL, and normal liver function tests.

In terms of his medications, he is instructed to continue taking his daily medications on the morning of surgery with just a small sip of water. He is advised to omit his metformin on the day of surgery due to concerns of potential lactic acidosis.

The patient has a smooth intraoperative course during surgery, which lasts approximately 2 hours. He is extubated uneventfully and transferred to the recovery room. Postoperatively, he is maintained on intravenous fluids for hydration and receives regular pain control for surgical incision discomfort.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with no complications noted. He is started on a clear liquid diet initially, which is advanced as tolerated. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remain stable throughout the hospital stay. The incision site is noted to be well-healed, with no signs of infection.

No postoperative complications such as wound infection, hematoma formation, or wound dehiscence are observed. The patient is discharged on postoperative day 2 with appropriate wound care instructions, pain medication, and a scheduled follow-up appointment with his surgeon.

Overall, the patient's surgery is successful, and his postoperative course is uncomplicated. He is advised to continue his regular diet and medications, including the resumption of metformin, after discharge. The patient is instructed to monitor his blood glucose levels closely and follow up with his primary care physician for further diabetes management.
