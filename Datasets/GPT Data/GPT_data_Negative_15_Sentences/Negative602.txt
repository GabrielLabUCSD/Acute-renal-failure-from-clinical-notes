The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with a history of chronic kidney disease, stage 3, secondary to hypertension. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. The patient currently takes medications including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He denies any known drug allergies.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone a cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. He did well and had an uneventful postoperative course. The patient also had a hernia repair surgery performed two years ago, which was also without any complications.

The patient is scheduled for an elective total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis of the left knee. His knee pain and functional limitation have significantly impacted his quality of life, leading to the decision for surgery. He has been working closely with a physical therapist to optimize his strength and range of motion prior to the procedure.

Preoperative investigations have been conducted, including routine blood work, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram, all of which were unremarkable. The patient will be scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. The surgical team will follow standard infection prevention protocols, including the administration of prophylactic antibiotics prior to the incision.

Following surgery, the patient will be monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit and will subsequently be transferred to the orthopedic unit for further recovery. Pain management will be provided through a multimodal approach, including intravenous medication initially and transitioning to oral analgesics as tolerated. Physical therapy will commence shortly after surgery to promote early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

A careful fluid management strategy will be employed to optimize the patient's renal function postoperatively. The care team will monitor the patient's urine output and renal function closely to detect any signs of acute kidney injury. Postoperative wound care and infection prevention measures will also be implemented diligently.

Complications that can arise during the postoperative course include surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. The patient will be educated about these potential complications and encouraged to report any concerning symptoms promptly.

In terms of the patient's postoperative course, he will be expected to gradually regain knee function with the help of physical therapy and rehabilitation. The patient will require close follow-up in the outpatient clinic to assess the progress of his recovery. In general, recovery from knee replacement surgery can take several months, with full functional improvement achieved within a year.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any complications during the postoperative course. He responded well to pain management, and his renal function remained stable throughout the recovery period. The patient was compliant with physical therapy and demonstrated good progress in terms of knee strength and range of motion. His wound healed without any signs of infection. Overall, the patient had a successful surgery with a satisfactory postoperative outcome.
