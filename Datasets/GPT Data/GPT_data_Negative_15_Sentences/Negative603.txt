The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a history of chronic knee pain and instability for the past five years. Despite conservative management with physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications, the patient's symptoms did not improve.
Imaging studies revealed severe osteoarthritis of the knee joint with significant degenerative changes. As a result, the patient has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.
The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of a myocardial infarction five years ago, for which he underwent coronary artery stenting. His cardiac function is stable, and the patient is currently on antiplatelet therapy.
Additionally, the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is managed with oral medications. His blood glucose levels have been well-controlled, with the most recent HbA1c being 6.8%.
The patient's preoperative laboratory tests are within normal limits, including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and liver function tests. His chest X-ray is also unremarkable.
During the surgery, the patient is placed under general anesthesia, and a standard total knee replacement procedure is performed. There were no intraoperative complications, and the surgery was deemed successful.
Following the surgery, the patient is closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit. Pain management is optimized with a combination of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical therapy is initiated on the day of surgery to promote early mobilization and function of the knee joint.
The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with stable vital signs and adequate pain control. He demonstrates good adherence to the physical therapy regimen and shows consistent progress in his mobility and strength.
There were no signs of wound infection or deep vein thrombosis noted. Prophylactic measures, such as sequential compression devices and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, were employed to minimize the risk of venous thromboembolism.
At the time of discharge, the patient has achieved near-full range of motion of the knee joint and is able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker. He is educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications and provided with appropriate contact information.
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess his progress and ensure proper wound healing. His postoperative pain is well-controlled with oral analgesics, and he has not experienced any adverse effects from the surgery or anesthesia.
In conclusion, this patient underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. He had a complex medical history, including hypertension, prior myocardial infarction with coronary artery stenting, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, all his comorbidities were well-controlled, and the surgical procedure went smoothly. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with good pain control and early functional recovery. No complications, including acute renal failure, were observed.
