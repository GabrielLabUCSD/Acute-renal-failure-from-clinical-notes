The patient is a 62-year-old male with a significant medical history. He has a long-standing history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His blood pressure has been well controlled with lisinopril 10 mg daily, and his diabetes has been managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He also takes atorvastatin 40 mg daily to control his cholesterol levels.

The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 10 years ago. He has an FEV1 of 55% predicted, indicating moderate COPD. He experiences mild dyspnea with exertion but denies any recent exacerbations or hospitalizations related to his respiratory condition.

Furthermore, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) three years ago. He underwent cardiac catheterization at that time, which showed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and a drug-eluting stent was placed. He has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel since then and has had no recurrent cardiac events.

The patient recently presented with worsening angina and was found to have restenosis in the previously stented artery on repeat cardiac catheterization. It was decided that he would undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and placement of another drug-eluting stent. As part of the preoperative evaluation, his medications were temporarily discontinued, and his blood glucose and blood pressure were optimized. His preoperative electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were within normal limits.

The patient received general anesthesia and underwent a successful PCI. His postoperative course was unremarkable, and he was transferred to the cardiac care unit for monitoring. His vital signs remained stable, and he was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor. He was also prescribed a beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate) and a statin (rosuvastatin) for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. His blood glucose levels were carefully monitored, and his metformin was restarted once his renal function was confirmed to be within normal limits.

During his hospital stay, the patient received pulmonary rehabilitation education to optimize his respiratory function. He was encouraged to quit smoking completely and referred to a smoking cessation program after discharge. The patient was provided with appropriate counseling regarding his medications, including the potential side effects and the importance of adherence.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with detailed discharge instructions. He was instructed to slowly increase his physical activity, gradually returning to his preoperative level. His outpatient follow-up was scheduled for one week post-discharge to assess his surgical wound, monitor his blood pressure, and evaluate his glycemic control.

There were no immediate postoperative complications noted in this patient. However, it is important to closely monitor him for any signs of infection, bleeding, or clotting at the site of intervention. In addition, regular assessment of kidney function is recommended due to his comorbidities and the use of nephrotoxic medications in the perioperative period.
