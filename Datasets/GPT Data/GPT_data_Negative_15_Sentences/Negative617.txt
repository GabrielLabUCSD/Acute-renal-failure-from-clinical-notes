Patient X is a 55-year-old male who has a significant medical history and is currently planning to undergo surgery. He has multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He is a former smoker, having quit 10 years ago, and does not consume alcohol.

The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus is well controlled with oral hypoglycemic medications. His blood pressure is also adequately managed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker. His hyperlipidemia is being treated with a statin.

The patient has a history of a myocardial infarction five years ago, for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and received two drug-eluting stents. His last cardiac catheterization performed a year ago showed patent stents and no new significant coronary artery disease.

In addition to his cardiovascular conditions, Patient X has been diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the left knee and has been experiencing significant pain and limited mobility. Non-pharmacological measures, such as physical therapy, have been unsuccessful in managing his symptoms, prompting the decision to proceed with surgical intervention.

Preoperative tests including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram have been performed and were within normal limits except for a slightly elevated fasting blood glucose level.

Patient X's surgery is scheduled for next week. His surgical team will perform a total knee replacement to alleviate his pain and improve his mobility. He has been informed of the risks and benefits of the procedure, as well as the potential complications, including infection, blood clots, and wound healing problems.

Postoperatively, Patient X will be closely monitored in the hospital for vital signs, pain control, and early ambulation. He will receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. Physical therapy will play a crucial role in his recovery, with exercises focused on joint mobilization and strengthening.

Complications can arise from any surgery. However, with proper preoperative screening, close monitoring, and adherence to best surgical practices, the risk of complications can be reduced. Patient X's postoperative course will be crucial in determining his outcome.

Please note that acute renal failure is not listed as a complication, as specifically requested.
