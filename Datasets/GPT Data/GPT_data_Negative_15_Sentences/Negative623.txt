The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a medical history significant for hypertension, controlled with Lisinopril, and a history of smoking. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. 

In the past, the patient has undergone a cholecystectomy for gallstones and a tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis. He has had no complications from these surgeries. Additionally, his tonsillectomy procedure was uneventful, with minimal postoperative pain and a prompt recovery. 

The patient has also had a history of chronic back pain, which has been managed conservatively with physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 

On physical examination, the patient is in otherwise good health, with a BMI of 27. Blood pressure is well-controlled at 120/80 mmHg, and he is afebrile. Cardiac auscultation reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal examination demonstrates a reducible hernia. 

Preoperative laboratory studies reveal a normal complete blood count (CBC) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), including liver and kidney function tests. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ². 

The patient has been adequately counseled on the surgical procedure, including risks, benefits, and possible complications. He understands the importance of preoperative fasting and is compliant with the required preoperative instructions. 

Postoperatively, the patient is monitored closely for signs of surgical site infection and wound healing. He is started on prophylactic antibiotics as per surgical guidelines. Pain management is addressed with the use of analgesics and a multimodal approach to optimize comfort and minimize opioid use. The patient is provided with education on coughing and deep breathing exercises to prevent pulmonary complications postoperatively. 

During his hospital stay, the patient's recovery is unremarkable, with no signs of postoperative bleeding or infection. He is able to ambulate and tolerate a regular diet without any difficulty. The patient's pain is well-controlled, and he is discharged home on postoperative day 2. 

In the months following surgery, the patient has a routine follow-up visit with his primary care physician. He reports no persistent pain, wound complications, or hernia recurrence. He has resumed his daily activities without any limitations and is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. However, he is encouraged to quit smoking to reduce his risk for future surgical complications.
