The patient is a 45-year-old male who has been experiencing worsening knee pain for the past six months. He has a past medical history significant for osteoarthritis of the knee, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Conservative measures such as physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have provided minimal relief.

Given the persistent pain and functional limitations, the patient has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery. Preoperative investigations have been completed, including blood tests, radiographic evaluation, and an electrocardiogram, all of which were within normal limits.

The patient has consented to the procedure after a thorough discussion of the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives. The surgical intervention will involve removing the damaged cartilage and bone and replacing it with an artificial joint made of metal and plastic.

In the postoperative period, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for a few hours. Intravenous pain medications will be administered to manage any discomfort initially. Physical therapy will be initiated on the first day after surgery to aid in range of motion exercises and to promote mobility.

The patient's recovery will involve a multidisciplinary approach, including pain management, wound care, and early ambulation. He will be encouraged to gradually increase weight-bearing on the operated leg under the guidance of the physical therapist.

Potential complications of the surgery include infection, blood clots, and damage to surrounding blood vessels or nerves. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis will be implemented through the use of compression stockings and blood thinning medications to reduce the risk of clots.

The patient will be discharged home when he is able to independently perform activities of daily living and has achieved certain mobility milestones. He will receive instructions on wound care, medication management, and precautions to prevent falls.

Post-discharge, the patient will be followed up regularly, initially at one week, three weeks, and six weeks post-surgery, and subsequently at longer intervals. X-rays will be taken at each visit to monitor the progress of the implanted joint and assess for any potential complications.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications such as infection or nerve damage. He reported a significant reduction in pain and improved mobility compared to preoperative levels. The physical therapy sessions were beneficial, and the patient continued to make progress in terms of knee flexion and extension.

Overall, the patient's surgery was successful, and he had a smooth postoperative recovery without any acute complications. Further follow-up will be conducted to evaluate the long-term outcomes of the total knee replacement and ensure the patient's continued improvement.
