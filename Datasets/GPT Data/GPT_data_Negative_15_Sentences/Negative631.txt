Patient X is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He presents with complaints of chronic knee pain and instability due to severe osteoarthritis, which has significantly impacted his daily activities and quality of life.

The patient has tried conservative measures including physical therapy, medications, and knee braces, but they provided only temporary relief. Therefore, he has opted for surgical intervention in the form of a total knee replacement.

Preoperatively, Patient X underwent comprehensive preoperative evaluation, which includes a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. His vital signs were stable, and his cardiopulmonary examinations were unremarkable. However, his body mass index (BMI) was 35, indicating obesity.

His preoperative laboratory workup showed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Lipid panel revealed elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride levels. His renal function was within normal limits, with a calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

Patient X was counseled by the anesthesia team regarding the risks associated with general anesthesia, including the possibility of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and sore throat. He provided informed consent for the procedure after discussing the risks and benefits with his orthopedic surgeon.

The surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications, and the patient received appropriate postoperative pain management. The patient was started on a course of prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infection and blood clot formation, respectively.

During the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored in the hospital for signs of wound infection, DVT, and other complications. He received physical therapy to promote early mobilization and rehabilitation.

Fortunately, patient X had an uneventful recovery and did not experience any complications, such as wound infection, DVT, deep surgical site infection, or postoperative bleeding. His pain was effectively managed, which allowed him to participate in physical therapy and achieve satisfactory functional outcomes.

Patient X was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with instructions for wound care, pain management, and physical therapy. He was instructed to follow up with his orthopedic surgeon for regular postoperative visits to monitor progress, manage pain and inflammation, and evaluate the overall success of the procedure.
