The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and stable angina. He has been managed on medications including amlodipine, atorvastatin, and metoprolol for the past several years. The patient is a former smoker but quit 10 years ago. He denies any history of allergies or previous surgeries.

The patient is currently scheduled for elective surgery to repair a herniated disc in the lumbar spine. Preoperative workup including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and electrocardiogram were within normal limits. A chest x-ray was also obtained and was unremarkable.

During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and the herniated disc was successfully repaired. The procedure took approximately 2 hours and was without any complications. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room where he was closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications.

In the postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remained stable and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. Pain management was achieved with a combination of analgesics including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical therapy was initiated on the day following surgery to promote early mobilization and to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's wound healing progressed well without any signs of infection. He did not experience any neurological deficits or loss of bowel or bladder function. His laboratory values including complete blood count and metabolic panel remained within normal limits throughout the postoperative period.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 3. He was provided with instructions for home care and pain management. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in 2 weeks for a wound check and further evaluation. No complications such as wound dehiscence, infection, or fluid collection were observed during the postoperative period. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and reported a significant improvement in his symptoms.
