The patient is a 57-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a gallbladder removal due to recurring gallstone attacks. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is well-controlled with oral medications. The patient has no known allergies to medications.

Upon initial evaluation, the patient's physical examination revealed a tender right upper abdominal quadrant with no signs of jaundice. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated liver function tests with mildly increased bilirubin levels. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of gallstones and ruled out any liver or biliary duct abnormalities.

The patient was managed conservatively with pain control and dietary modifications. However, due to persistent symptoms and recurrent attacks, the decision for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was made. The patient was counseled about the procedure and the potential risks involved, including bleeding, infection, and injury to the bile ducts.

Preoperatively, the patient's blood pressure was well-controlled on antihypertensive medications, and his blood glucose levels were within the target range. He underwent the surgery without any complications. The procedure was uneventful, and four gallstones were removed from the gallbladder.

Postoperatively, the patient received appropriate pain management and was closely monitored for signs of any complications. His vital signs remained stable during the recovery period, and his oral intake was gradually resumed. The patient was ambulating well and there were no signs of surgical site infection.

Two days post-surgery, the patient was discharged home in stable condition with instructions for follow-up within two weeks. He was prescribed a short course of antibiotics as prophylaxis against surgical site infection and was advised to continue his regular antihypertensive and diabetes medications.

The patient was seen for a follow-up appointment two weeks later, and he reported an unremarkable recovery. His surgical wounds had healed well, and there were no signs of infection or bile duct injury. The patient's liver function tests had returned to normal, and he was advised to continue his routine medications and maintain a healthy diet.

In summary, the patient underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone removal. His postoperative course was smooth and free from any complications. The patient was discharged home and had a positive outcome during the follow-up visit.
