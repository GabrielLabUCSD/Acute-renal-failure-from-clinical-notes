The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He has a history of two stents placed in his coronary arteries in the past five years. The patient is currently managed on a daily dose of aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and metformin without any reported adverse effects.
 
His surgical history reveals a cholecystectomy performed at the age of 45 due to symptomatic gallstones. He had an unremarkable recovery from that procedure. The patient also reports having had a hernia repair surgery five years ago with an uneventful postoperative course and no subsequent hernia recurrence. 

The patient is scheduled for an elective total knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis in the right knee joint. He has been experiencing significant chronic pain and limitations in mobility, affecting his quality of life. Preoperative assessments including EKG, chest x-ray, and basic blood work have been completed, all of which were within normal limits.
 
The patient has been advised to discontinue his aspirin five days prior to surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding, but all other medications are to be continued until the day of the procedure. He has been instructed to have nothing to eat or drink after midnight the night before the surgery. The surgical team has been notified of his allergies, which consist of a rash in reaction to penicillin.
 
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient will be closely monitored for pain control, infection, and blood clot formation. He will receive prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the risk of surgical site infection. Physical therapy will be initiated to promote mobility and joint function and to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.
 
The patient is expected to stay in the hospital for three to four days after surgery and will then be transitioned to a rehabilitation facility for further therapy and recovery. Home health visits may be arranged for continued monitoring and assistance. He will be started on anticoagulant therapy to prevent thrombosis and advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient.
 
Although the patient is generally in good health, surgical complications can occur. Complications such as wound infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or blood clot formation may arise postoperatively. Measures will be taken to prevent and promptly treat such complications to ensure a smooth recovery. The patient will be educated about red-flag symptoms indicating potential complications and encouraged to report any concerns promptly.
