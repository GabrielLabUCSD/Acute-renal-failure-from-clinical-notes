The patient is a 65-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on medications including metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and aspirin.

In terms of surgeries, the patient previously had a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure five years ago due to symptomatic angina. The surgery was successful, and the patient has been stable since then. He also had a cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones two years ago, with an uneventful postoperative course.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. His body mass index (BMI) is 28 kg/m2, and he appears well-nourished. Cardiac examination reveals regular heart sounds without any murmurs, while pulmonary examination is clear.

Laboratory investigations show a fasting blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL, HbA1c of 7.2%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 100 mg/dL, and normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave changes.

Based on the patient's medical history and clinical evaluation, it is important to ensure perioperative management of his chronic conditions. Prior to surgery, clearance from both cardiology and endocrinology is obtained to optimize his cardiac and metabolic status. The patient is advised to withhold his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the morning of surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient is observed in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for monitoring and pain management. He receives appropriate deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin. Physiotherapy is initiated early to prevent postoperative complications, and the patient is encouraged to ambulate as tolerated.

Fortunately, the patient's postoperative course is uneventful, and he gradually recovers his normal activities of daily living. He is discharged home on the third postoperative day with oral pain medications and instructions for follow-up with his primary care physician. The patient is advised to resume his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications as before surgery.

There were no notable complications following surgery, such as wound infections, respiratory distress, or postoperative bleeding. The patient's renal function remained stable throughout the entire perioperative period. He is recommended to continue routine follow-up visits with his specialists and adopt a healthy lifestyle to prevent disease progression.
