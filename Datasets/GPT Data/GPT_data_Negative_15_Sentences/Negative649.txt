The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. The patient originally presented with chronic knee pain and limited mobility, which significantly affected his quality of life.

His surgical history includes an appendectomy performed in his early twenties and a cholecystectomy in his forties. The patient does not have any known drug allergies and is currently taking metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and simvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He has no history of bleeding disorders or previous blood transfusions.

Preoperative laboratory results demonstrated a hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 8,000 cells/microL, and a platelet count of 250,000 platelets/microL. The patient's creatinine level was within the normal range at 0.9 mg/dL, indicating normal renal function. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, and his chest x-ray was unremarkable.

The patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia with no complications during the procedure. The surgeons found severe degeneration of the articular cartilage in his knee joint, confirming the need for a total knee replacement. The surgery lasted approximately three hours. 

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery unit and closely monitored. He received prophylactic antibiotics and pain management through patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to facilitate early mobilization and improve range of motion.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of infection or wound complications noted. He was able to bear weight on the operated leg with the assistance of a walker on the second postoperative day. Regular monitoring of his vital signs and wound care were performed during his hospital stay. His pain was adequately managed, enabling him to participate actively in physical therapy sessions.

Upon discharge, the patient was provided with a comprehensive plan for postoperative care, including outpatient physical therapy and instructions for wound care. He was advised to continue his regular medications as prescribed and to follow up with his primary care physician for routine check-ups.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery and an uncomplicated postoperative course. He demonstrated good compliance with the prescribed medications and physical therapy, leading to steady improvement in his knee function and rehabilitation progress.
