The patient is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. He has been stable on his current medication regimen, which includes metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension.

The patient is scheduled to undergo an elective surgery for cholecystectomy due to symptomatic cholelithiasis. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past six months. The pain is usually triggered by fatty meals.

On physical examination, the patient is well-appearing and in no acute distress. He is afebrile and his vital signs are stable. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the right upper quadrant but no signs of peritonitis. Laboratory tests show a normal complete blood count and liver function tests. His renal function, as measured by serum creatinine, is within the normal range.

The patient has been instructed to undergo a preoperative evaluation which includes an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and basic metabolic panel. His ECG shows sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities. Chest X-ray is unremarkable. The basic metabolic panel demonstrates normal electrolytes and normal renal function.

He has been advised to discontinue his metformin 48 hours prior to surgery due to the potential risk of lactic acidosis. The patient has been provided with detailed preoperative instructions and has expressed understanding of the procedure and its risks.

The patient underwent surgery without any immediate intraoperative complications. General anesthesia was administered, and the surgery was completed successfully. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in a stable condition.

In the PACU, the patient's vital signs remained stable, with no signs of hypotension or tachycardia. He received appropriate pain management and was closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications. He was encouraged to ambulate and deep breathe to reduce the risk of complications such as atelectasis or deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not develop any major complications during his hospital stay. Despite the normal renal function measured preoperatively, the patient did not experience acute renal failure postoperatively. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and his pain was well-controlled with oral analgesics.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with instructions for wound care and pain management. He was advised to follow up with his surgeon in two weeks for a postoperative visit. The patient reported feeling well, with no complaints of pain or other concerning symptoms during his follow-up visit.

In summary, a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension underwent an elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The surgery was successful without intraoperative complications, and the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. No complications, including acute renal failure, were reported postoperatively. The patient was discharged home in good condition and had a satisfactory follow-up visit two weeks later.
