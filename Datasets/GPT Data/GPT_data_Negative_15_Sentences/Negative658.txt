Patient X is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presents with a need for surgery due to chronic gallbladder disease, characterized by recurrent episodes of biliary colic. His blood pressure has been well controlled on a combination of antihypertensive medications, and his diabetes is managed with diet and exercise alone. The patient has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago.

On examination, the patient's vital signs are stable, and he appears in good overall health. His abdominal examination shows mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with no palpable masses or hepatomegaly. Laboratory results show a normal complete blood count and liver function tests. Serum glucose levels are within the target range, and HbA1c is 6.8%.

During the preoperative evaluation, an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and echocardiogram were performed, which demonstrated no significant abnormalities. The patient was deemed fit for surgery and was counseled on the procedure, including its risks and benefits. The surgical team planned for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Following the surgery, the patient initially made an uneventful recovery. His vital signs remained stable, and pain control was achieved with opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient was encouraged to ambulate early and received postoperative physiotherapy. His diet was gradually advanced from clear liquids to a regular diet.

On the third postoperative day, the patient developed fever (38.5Â°C) and mild abdominal pain. Laboratory tests revealed an elevation in liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin levels. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed fluid collection in the subhepatic space. The patient was diagnosed with a postoperative bile leak and was managed with percutaneous drainage of the fluid collection, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and hepatobiliary stent placement.

Over the course of the next few days, the patient's symptoms gradually improved. The fever resolved, and liver function tests showed a downward trend. The percutaneous drain was removed, and the patient was discharged with a prescription for a course of oral antibiotics, with instructions for close follow-up.

In summary, Patient X, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for chronic gallbladder disease. He had an uneventful immediate postoperative course but developed a postoperative bile leak on the third day, which was managed successfully with percutaneous drainage, antibiotics, and stent placement. The patient's symptoms improved, and he was discharged home with a prescription for oral antibiotics and follow-up instructions.
