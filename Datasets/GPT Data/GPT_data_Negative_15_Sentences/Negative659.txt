The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He has been taking metformin for diabetes control and lisinopril for blood pressure management for the past 10 years. He had a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago, which was managed conservatively with medication.

The patient is presenting for elective surgery to address chronic knee pain and limited mobility. His recent workup revealed severe osteoarthritis on imaging studies. The patient has undergone conservative treatment with physiotherapy and analgesics but continues to have persistent symptoms affecting his quality of life.

In preoperative assessments, the patient's blood work demonstrated well-controlled glycemic levels with HbA1c of 7.2% and normal electrolytes. His renal function was within normal limits. He was cleared by a cardiologist for surgery, with a stress test revealing good exercise tolerance and absence of ischemic changes.

The patient underwent uncomplicated surgery and received general anesthesia. The procedure was performed smoothly, with no intraoperative complications or excessive blood loss. He required a short stay in the post-anesthesia care unit for monitoring and was later taken to the surgical ward.

During the postoperative period, the patient received pain management with patient-controlled analgesia. Additionally, physical therapy was initiated promptly to aid in early mobilization and joint range of motion exercises. His wound site was monitored closely for signs of infection, with no evidence of dehiscence, erythema, or pus formation observed.

The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the second postoperative day. He was prescribed a course of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. Instructions were given regarding wound care, diet modifications, and medication compliance.

In subsequent follow-up visits, the patient reported good pain relief and improved mobility. Physical therapy sessions were continued as an outpatient to further enhance functional outcomes and strengthen the surrounding musculature. The patient's incision site showed adequate healing without any signs of breakdown or delayed wound closure.

The patient did not experience any complications during his postoperative course. He did not develop deep vein thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, or postoperative infections. His diabetes and blood pressure remained well-controlled during the perioperative period with no episodes of hyper- or hypoglycemia or significant blood pressure fluctuations.

In conclusion, the patient successfully underwent elective surgery for severe osteoarthritis, with an unremarkable postoperative course. He achieved relief from pain and improved mobility postoperatively. The patient's medical conditions were well-managed, and he did not experience any major complications during his surgical journey.
