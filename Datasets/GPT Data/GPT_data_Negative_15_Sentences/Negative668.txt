He had a routine physical examination three months ago, which was unremarkable. The patient takes medications for his chronic conditions, including lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

His hypertension is well-controlled with medication, and his blood pressure readings have been consistently within the normal range. His diabetes is also well-controlled with lifestyle modifications and medication, and his hemoglobin A1c level has been maintained below 7%.

The patient has a history of smoking, but he quit five years ago. He has no known drug allergies and denies any previous surgeries, hospitalizations, or significant family medical history. He is a non-drinker and denies any illicit drug use.

During preoperative assessments, his vital signs were stable. Laboratory test results demonstrated normal renal function, liver function, and coagulation parameters. His chest X-ray and electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. The patient was deemed as a good candidate for surgery based on these results.

Following surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He recovered well from anesthesia and was monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit. He was started on appropriate pain management and intravenous fluids were administered to maintain hydration. The patient's surgical wound was examined regularly for signs of infection and appropriate dressings were applied. The patient was encouraged to ambulate early to minimize the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
