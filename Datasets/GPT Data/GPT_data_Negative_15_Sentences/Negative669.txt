The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. He has been managed on oral anti-hypertensive medications and insulin for glycemic control. His blood pressure and blood sugar levels have been fairly well-controlled with no recent episodes of hypo- or hyperglycemia.

He also has a long history of smoking, with a 30-pack-year history. However, he quit smoking 2 years ago. He has no significant family history of any chronic illnesses or surgical complications.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery for severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. He has been experiencing exertional chest pain, shortness of breath, and occasional palpitations. His cardiac workup including a stress test demonstrated significant ischemia in multiple areas of the heart.

Prior to surgery, he underwent a pre-operative assessment that included a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation profile, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). All laboratory results were within normal limits, and his ECG did not show any significant abnormalities.

In addition, he met with the anesthesiologist to discuss anesthesia options and potential risks. The patient expressed understanding and gave informed consent for the surgery.

The patient's surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications. He tolerated the surgery well under general anesthesia. A triple bypass procedure was completed successfully, with saphenous vein grafts used for the bypass.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He was extubated within 8 hours after the surgery and started on oral pain medications and prophylactic antibiotics.

He was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises regularly to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis. The patient showed no signs of surgical site infection or wound complications throughout the hospital stay.

His postoperative course was uneventful with no major complications. He had mild postoperative pain that was managed effectively with analgesics. Blood pressure, blood sugar, and fluid balance were closely monitored and maintained within the target range.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with appropriate pain medications and instructions for wound care and recovery. He was advised to continue his anti-hypertensive medications, insulin therapy, and engage in a cardiac rehabilitation program for optimal recovery. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon was scheduled in 2 weeks for wound evaluation and consideration of long-term lipid-lowering therapy.

In conclusion, the patient underwent an elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery without complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home with no acute renal failure or other significant complications.
