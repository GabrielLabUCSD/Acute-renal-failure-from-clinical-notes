The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with chronic renal insufficiency and has a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. He is also a former smoker with a 20-pack-year smoking history. The patient has been one medication for his hypertension and diabetes, keeping both conditions relatively controlled.

The patient is now scheduled to undergo surgery, specifically a cholecystectomy, due to presence of symptomatic cholelithiasis. Preoperative labs revealed mildly elevated liver function tests, but his renal function remains stable with a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed, showing no significant abnormalities.

During the surgery, the patient tolerated general anesthesia well, and there were no intraoperative complications. The procedure was completed laparoscopically, and the gallbladder was successfully removed. The patient was then transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).

In the PACU, the patient initially experienced mild postoperative pain, which was managed with intravenous opioids. He was monitored closely for signs of infection, bleeding, or other complications. The patient received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis through subcutaneous heparin injections. He was encouraged to ambulate and guided through respiratory exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia or thromboembolism.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and he did not experience any major complications. His pain was well controlled with oral analgesics, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any signs of gastrointestinal distress. The patient was discharged two days after surgery and was advised to follow up with his primary care physician.

Overall, this patient's surgical experience went smoothly, and he recovered well without any complications. He was compliant with postoperative instructions and had a successful outcome, allowing him to resume his normal daily activities without limitations.
