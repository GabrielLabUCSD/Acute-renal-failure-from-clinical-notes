The patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He is scheduled for surgery to address a chronic knee issue that has been causing significant pain and mobility problems. The patient has been experiencing knee pain for the past five years, progressively worsening over time.

He has previously undergone two knee surgeries, including a meniscectomy and arthroscopy, which provided temporary relief. However, the pain and functional limitations returned after a short period. The patient has been managing his knee pain with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy.

Preoperative evaluations revealed stable blood pressure and blood glucose levels. His cardiac assessment, including an EKG and echocardiogram, showed no significant abnormalities. The patient is not on any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, infection, and wound healing. He was started on a postoperative pain management protocol, including scheduled NSAIDs and opioid analgesics as needed. Physical therapy was initiated early to promote range of motion and muscle strength.

The patient experienced some postoperative complications, including a surgical site infection. He presented with increased pain, redness, and swelling around the surgical wound. Wound cultures were obtained and revealed the presence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Intravenous antibiotics were initiated, targeting MRSA, and the patient showed improvement with resolution of infection after a week of treatment.

Additional postoperative course included the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the affected leg. The patient presented with calf pain, swelling, and warmth. Compression ultrasound confirmed the presence of DVT, and anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin was initiated. The patient was closely monitored for any bleeding or thrombotic complications throughout the treatment period.

Despite these complications, the patient's knee pain improved significantly after surgery, and he regained functional mobility. Physical therapy was continued on an outpatient basis to further optimize his strength and range of motion. Close follow-up was scheduled to monitor the healing of previous complications and to prevent further ones.
