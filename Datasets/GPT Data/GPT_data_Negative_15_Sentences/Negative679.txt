The patient is a 60-year-old male who presents with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He has been on medication for these conditions, including antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, and statins. His blood pressure and blood sugar levels have been controlled adequately with these medications. He had a previous myocardial infarction and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery five years ago, which was successful.

The patient is now planning to undergo elective surgery for a hernia repair. He has been experiencing discomfort and pain in the hernia site, and it has started to impact his daily activities. He has no known drug allergies and has not had any recent hospitalizations or surgeries.

In preparation for the surgery, the patient has undergone preoperative evaluations, including laboratory tests and an electrocardiogram. His laboratory results indicate normal kidney function, and his cardiovascular evaluation did not show any signs of myocardial ischemia or significant arrhythmias.

The patient underwent the hernia repair surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure went smoothly, and the surgeon reported good tissue repair with minimal blood loss. He was observed in the recovery room, where his vital signs remained stable. He received analgesics for pain control and antibiotics for infection prevention.

In the postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for any complications. He did not develop any immediate complications such as wound infections, bleeding, or wound dehiscence. His vital signs remained within normal limits, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. The patient's pain was adequately managed with a combination of oral pain medications.

The patient was encouraged to engage in early mobilization to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. He was instructed on proper wound care and given follow-up instructions. The patient was also educated on signs and symptoms to watch out for and when to seek medical attention.

During the follow-up visit, the patient reported satisfactory pain control and improvement in his hernia symptoms. His wound was clean and healing well without any signs of infection. He had a good range of motion and no evidence of complications such as seroma or hematoma.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications. He was able to resume his normal activities gradually and was advised to continue with his regular medications. The patient was scheduled for a routine follow-up appointment in one month to assess his progress further.
