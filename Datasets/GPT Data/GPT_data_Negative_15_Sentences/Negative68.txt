His coronary artery disease was diagnosed five years ago, and he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Since then, the patient has been free of angina symptoms and has remained on aspirin and clopidogrel for dual antiplatelet therapy. He has not experienced any cardiac events or hospitalizations related to his coronary artery disease.

His renal function is also normal, with a calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

Following the surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was closely monitored in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for the first 24 hours, and vital signs remained stable. He was ambulated on the first postoperative day and started on a clear liquid diet.

The patient's surgical wound healed well with no signs of infection or dehiscence. His pain was adequately controlled with the use of intravenous opioids and oral analgesics. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was also initiated, and no thrombotic complications were observed.

In conclusion, Patient X has a stable medical history with well-managed hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia. His surgical procedure had an uneventful postoperative course, and he did not experience any complications. The patient is expected to recover fully and resume his daily activities.
