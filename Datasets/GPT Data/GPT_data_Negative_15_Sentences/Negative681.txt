The patient is a 55-year-old female who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. She has been on regular medication for these conditions, including metoprolol, metformin, and atorvastatin. She has a family history of heart disease, with her father having had a heart attack at age 60.

The patient is currently planning to undergo surgery for cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. She has been experiencing recurrent episodes of biliary colic, characterized by right upper quadrant abdominal pain, especially after consuming fatty meals. The patient has undergone multiple imaging studies, including ultrasound and MRI, which revealed the presence of multiple gallstones.

Her preoperative workup included a complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, all of which were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

In terms of her postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for the first few hours. She was started on intravenous fluids and received pain medication as needed. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period.

During the postoperative period, the patient experienced mild incisional pain, for which she was prescribed oral analgesics. She was able to tolerate oral intake without any issues and was gradually advanced to a regular diet. The patient was encouraged to ambulate to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient did not develop any major complications postoperatively. There were no signs of surgical site infection, wound dehiscence, or incisional hernia. She did not experience any postoperative bleeding that required intervention. Her incision sites were clean and well-approximated.

The patient's postoperative recovery was smooth, and she was discharged home on the second postoperative day. She was given oral antibiotics to complete a short course. The patient was advised to follow up with her primary care provider in one week for wound evaluation and removal of any sutures.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, and she achieved resolution of her gallstone-related symptoms. She did not have any complications directly related to the surgery. The patient was pleased with the outcome and resumed her regular activities gradually as tolerated.
