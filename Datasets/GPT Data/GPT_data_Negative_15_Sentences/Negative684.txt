Patient X is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery for the treatment of a herniated disc. He has a past medical history significant for chronic low back pain and degenerative disc disease. Patient X has been managing his symptoms with physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and occasional epidural steroid injections for the past year. His pain has recently worsened, leading to the decision for surgical intervention.

Patient X has had previous surgical procedures including an appendectomy at the age of 20 and a tonsillectomy at the age of 8. He has a history of hypertension, controlled with a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. His current blood pressure readings have been consistently within normal limits. The patient does not have any allergies to medications or known adverse reactions.

On examination, Patient X is an obese individual with a body mass index (BMI) of 31, which has been stable over the past year. His cardiovascular exam is unremarkable, with a regular rate and rhythm. He has full range of motion in his extremities, but lower back tenderness is noted on palpation. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation in the L5-S1 dermatome of the left lower extremity, as well as diminished left ankle reflex.

Preoperative laboratory studies including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. Patient X also underwent a preoperative anesthesia evaluation, which revealed no contraindications to surgery. He was instructed to stop taking NSAIDs and anticoagulants one week prior to surgery.

Following the surgical procedure, Patient X's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He was started on a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for pain management and regular nursing assessments were performed. He tolerated a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day and had no complaints of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort.

Patient X was provided with physical therapy instructions for postoperative rehabilitation and advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the first six weeks after surgery. He was discharged home on the second postoperative day with a prescription for opioid pain medication and a follow-up appointment scheduled for two weeks later.

During the postoperative period, Patient X experienced no complications such as wound infection, urinary retention, or deep vein thrombosis. His pain was well-controlled with the prescribed medications and he reported gradual improvement in his lower back symptoms in the weeks following surgery. Patient X successfully completed his physical therapy sessions and was able to resume his daily activities without limitations or further exacerbation of pain.
