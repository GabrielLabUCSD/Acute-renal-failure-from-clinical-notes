Prior to surgery, the patient had a thorough assessment by the anesthesia team, which included an evaluation of his airway, cardiopulmonary status, and overall fitness for surgery. The anesthesiologist determined that the patient was at an increased risk for perioperative complications due to his obesity and sedentary lifestyle.

The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was able to tolerate oral intake without any difficulty.

He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine postoperative evaluation. The patient did not experience any complications during his postoperative course.

In summary, Patient X, a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, underwent hernia repair surgery. He had a well-controlled medical history, and his preoperative evaluation revealed no significant abnormalities. The patient had a general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation due to his increased risk for complications.
