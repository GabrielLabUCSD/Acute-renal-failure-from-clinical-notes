Patient X is a 58-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is scheduled to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement. Her preoperative evaluation revealed well-controlled blood pressure, fasting blood glucose within target range, and normal lipid levels. She is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension, Metformin for diabetes, and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

The patient's surgery is planned due to severe osteoarthritis of her right knee, causing significant pain and functional limitations. She has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications, but her symptoms have not improved. X-ray findings showed marked joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation, confirming the need for surgery.

Regarding surgical risks, the patient has been informed about potential complications, including infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding. She understands the importance of postoperative mobility to prevent these complications. Patient X has received preoperative counseling regarding pain management and rehabilitation, enhancing her understanding of the surgery and expectations.

Postoperatively, the patient's recovery has been favorable so far. She received antibiotics prophylaxis before surgery and has not shown any signs of infection at the incision site. Adequate pain control was achieved through a multimodal approach, combining opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. Patient X's mobility gradually improved with the assistance of a physical therapist.

However, during the postoperative course, she developed an allergic reaction to one of the narcotics used for pain control. This was managed promptly by discontinuing the medication and administering antihistamines. No other complications, such as wound dehiscence or intraoperative vascular injury, were encountered. Her recovery has progressed well, and she is expected to be discharged home within the next few days. She will continue pain medications, physical therapy, and close follow-up with her primary care physician to ensure optimal rehabilitation.

In conclusion, Patient X, a 58-year-old female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, is planning to undergo total knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis. Her postoperative course has been favorable, with no signs of infection at the surgical site. However, she experienced an allergic reaction to a narcotic, which was promptly managed. Her recovery has progressed well, and she is anticipated to be discharged soon. Close monitoring and follow-up will be necessary to ensure her optimal rehabilitation.
