Patient X is a 45-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of chronic lower back pain. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, with a BMI of 35. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications and statins for the last five years.

He has a history of cigarette smoking for 10 years, but he quit smoking five years ago. However, he still reports occasional alcohol consumption on weekends. The patient has never had any major surgical procedures in the past.

During the preoperative evaluation, it was noted that the patient's blood pressure was well controlled on his current medication regimen. His BMI and lipid profile were within acceptable ranges. However, further investigations revealed mild renal dysfunction, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 55 mL/min/1.73m2.

The patient was scheduled for elective lumbar decompression surgery due to severe spinal stenosis causing his back pain. In the postoperative period, the patient received appropriate pain management and was closely monitored in the recovery room. He tolerated the surgery well and did not experience any significant complications intraoperatively.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and his back pain improved significantly following surgery. He was able to ambulate with assistance on the second day after surgery and gradually regained strength and mobility.

During the hospital stay, the patient's renal function remained stable, with creatinine levels ranging from 1.2 to 1.4 mg/dL and eGFR ranging from 50 to 55 mL/min/1.73m2. He was referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation of his chronic kidney disease.

No other complications, such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or respiratory issues, were encountered during the postoperative period. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate analgesic medication and instructions for activity restrictions.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to address the patient's back pain, renal function, and management of his chronic comorbidities. The patient was educated about the importance of smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol consumption to minimize the risk of cardiovascular complications.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery with a positive postoperative course, experiencing improved pain control and mobility. The mild chronic kidney disease was a known preoperative condition and did not worsen postoperatively as documented by stable renal function throughout the hospital stay.
