The patient is a 45-year-old male who has recently been diagnosed with a kidney stone. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which are well-controlled with medications. The patient is currently taking lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin.

Upon further investigation, it was revealed that the patient has been experiencing intermittent flank pain and hematuria over the past week. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of a renal stone measuring approximately 8mm. After a thorough discussion about the available treatment options, the patient and his urologist have decided to proceed with surgical intervention.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a minimally invasive procedure known as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This non-invasive approach involves the use of shock waves to break down the kidney stone into smaller fragments, allowing for their eventual passage through the urinary tract. The patient has been informed about the potential risks and benefits of the procedure, including the possibility of post-procedural complications.

Following the successful completion of the ESWL procedure, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course, with resolution of his flank pain and hematuria. He was able to tolerate oral intake and ambulate without difficulty. In terms of pain management, the patient was initially prescribed a short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control any residual discomfort.

During the postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely for any signs of infection or urinary retention. He was instructed to maintain adequate hydration and was given specific guidelines regarding diet and fluid intake to prevent future stone formation. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for the patient two weeks after the procedure to assess his overall progress and to review the results of a repeat imaging study.

Overall, the patient's surgical intervention for his kidney stone was successfully performed without complications. He is expected to make a full recovery and resume his normal activities within a few days. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the procedure and expressed relief that the stone has been effectively treated. He was advised to contact his healthcare provider immediately if he experiences any recurrent symptoms or develops new concerns.
