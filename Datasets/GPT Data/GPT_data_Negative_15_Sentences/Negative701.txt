Patient X is a 65-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, controlled with medication, and type 2 diabetes, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair.

In addition to his hypertension and diabetes, the patient has a history of dyslipidemia, which is controlled with statin therapy. He is a nonsmoker and denies heavy alcohol consumption. He has no known drug allergies.

Patient X has had no previous surgeries and his preoperative laboratory values are within normal limits. His blood pressure is well-controlled, with readings consistently around 130/80 mmHg.
