Patient X is a 65-year-old male who has recently been diagnosed with a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. He has been experiencing severe lower back pain for the past six months, which has not responded to conservative treatment such as physical therapy, pain medications, and epidural steroid injections. After discussing his options with his orthopedic surgeon, the decision has been made to proceed with surgery to remove the herniated disc.

Patient X has a past medical history significant for hypertension, for which he takes amlodipine 5 mg daily. He also has a history of dyslipidemia, managed with atorvastatin 20 mg daily. He exercises regularly and maintains a healthy lifestyle. His blood pressure and lipid levels are well controlled with his current medications.

The surgical procedure planned for Patient X is a microdiscectomy. This minimally invasive procedure involves removing the portion of the herniated disc that is compressing the adjacent nerve root. The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia, and the recovery period is typically rapid.

Postoperatively, Patient X was closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of complications such as excessive bleeding, infection, or neurological deficits. His vital signs remained stable, and he regained consciousness without any issues. He was started on a clear liquid diet and encouraged to ambulate as tolerated.

Patient X received appropriate pain management with a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. His pain was well controlled, and he reported significant improvement in his lower back pain compared to his preoperative status. He was able to perform his activities of daily living without any difficulty.

During his hospital stay, Patient X was managed with prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. He was closely monitored for any signs of wound complications, such as redness, swelling, or drainage. No abnormal findings were noted, and the surgical wound appeared to be healing well.

On the second day postoperatively, Patient X was able to tolerate a regular diet and was discharged home with a prescription for oral pain medications. He was instructed to gradually increase his activity level while avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next few weeks.

During his follow-up visit at two weeks postoperatively, Patient X reported continued improvement in his lower back pain. He had minimal residual discomfort, which was well controlled with over-the-counter pain medications. He had resumed his regular exercise routine and had returned to work without any restrictions.

Patient X did not experience any complications during his postoperative course. His surgical outcome was successful, and he achieved the desired relief of his symptoms. There were no signs of infection, wound dehiscence, or neurological deficits. The herniated disc was successfully removed, and Patient X had a smooth recovery without any significant adverse events.
