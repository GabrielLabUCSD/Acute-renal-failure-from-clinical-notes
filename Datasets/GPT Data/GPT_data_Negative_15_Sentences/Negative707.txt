The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents to the clinic with complaints of chronic knee pain and functional impairment. After conservative management failed to alleviate his symptoms, he has elected to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Upon further review of his medical history, it is noted that he has a history of smoking, with a 20-pack-year history. He quit smoking ten years ago. He has never been diagnosed with any pulmonary diseases, but he occasionally experiences mild shortness of breath with exertion. Spirometry testing conducted a year ago showed mild obstructive lung disease with a FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.74.

Cardiovascular-wise, the patient has a significant family history of coronary artery disease but has never experienced any cardiac events himself. His most recent echocardiogram revealed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy without evidence of valvular abnormalities. He is currently on a daily regimen of aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and metformin.

He has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, consistent with obesity. He has made attempts to lose weight in the past, but long-term success has been elusive. His recent blood work demonstrates well-controlled diabetes with an HbA1c of 6.9%.

He is currently scheduled for total knee replacement surgery in three weeks' time. Standard preoperative assessments, including blood work and electrocardiogram, were unremarkable. He has been counseled on the importance of smoking cessation before surgery and has agreed to participate in a smoking cessation program.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful course with no complications. He received prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Pain management included a combination of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with a focus on early mobilization and physical therapy. He was diligent in performing his breathing exercises to minimize the risk of atelectasis.

His knee rehabilitation went smoothly, and he achieved good range of motion by the time of discharge. His wound healed well without any signs of infection, and he did not experience any postoperative bleeding or hematoma formation. His vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay, and there were no indications of cardiovascular or pulmonary issues.

In summary, this patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery. He has a history of smoking but quit ten years ago, although he has mild obstructive lung disease. He has no significant cardiac history, but an echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. His BMI indicates obesity, and his diabetes is well-controlled. Preoperative assessments were unremarkable, and he has been advised on smoking cessation. Postoperatively, he had an uncomplicated course, achieving good functional outcomes with no signs of infection, bleeding, or other complications.
