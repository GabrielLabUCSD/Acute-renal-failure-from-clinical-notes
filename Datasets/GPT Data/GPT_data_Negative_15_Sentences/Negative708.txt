The patient is a 55-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and osteoarthritis. She is scheduled to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement. The decision was made due to severe knee pain and joint destruction limiting her daily activities. 

Her hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of amlodipine and a beta-blocker. She has been a known diabetic for 10 years and manages her blood glucose levels with metformin and insulin. Her HbA1c is within target range at 7.2%. 

Preoperatively, her blood pressure and blood sugar levels have been closely monitored and optimized. She has been counseled on the importance of glycemic control before and after surgery. The patient is a non-smoker and her preoperative chest x-ray and EKG were unremarkable. 

Laboratory investigations revealed a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests. Her serum creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL. She does not have a history of chronic kidney disease and her estimated glomerular filtration rate is within the normal range. 

Anesthesia consultation highlighted no contraindications to general anesthesia. She has been advised on preoperative fasting and cessation of antihypertensives and antidiabetic medications on the morning of surgery. 

The patient underwent surgery without any complications. She received general anesthesia, and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered according to hospital protocol. The surgical team reported no unexpected findings during the procedure and blood loss was within normal limits. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. 

Her vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period, and appropriate postoperative analgesia was administered. She started physical therapy on the day of surgery to aid in early mobilization and rehabilitation. 

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she did not experience any major complications such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, or wound dehiscence. Her pain was well-managed with a combination of oral analgesics and regional nerve blocks. 

On the second postoperative day, she was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker. Her glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin therapy was adjusted as needed to maintain glycemic control. 

The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day with appropriate discharge instructions, including wound care, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments. She was advised to continue physical therapy and gradually increase weight-bearing on her operated knee. 

Overall, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery without any postoperative complications. She is expected to have an improved quality of life with reduced knee pain and increased mobility.
