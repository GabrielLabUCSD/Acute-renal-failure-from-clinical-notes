Patient Summary:

The patient is a middle-aged adult who is planning to have surgery. They have a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The patient's blood pressure is generally well-controlled on a combination of antihypertensive medications. Their cholesterol levels are managed with statin therapy, and their blood glucose is well-managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. However, the patient's body mass index (BMI) is above the normal range, indicating obesity.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has never undergone any major surgeries in the past. However, it is important to note that the patient is a long-term smoker with a 30-pack year smoking history. They do not have a significant history of respiratory conditions, although they occasionally experience mild cough and shortness of breath.

Aside from these chronic conditions, the patient does not have any known allergies to medications or any history of adverse reactions during previous hospitalizations. They take over-the-counter medications sporadically and do not report any recent infections or hospitalizations. The patient is up to date on vaccinations, including tetanus and influenza immunizations.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. The surgical team followed enhanced recovery protocols, which helped in achieving optimal pain control and minimizing complications. The patient was closely monitored for any signs of surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism, but none of these complications were observed. They were prescribed a course of prophylactic antibiotics and were able to tolerate oral feedings without any issues. In terms of pain management, the patient was initially on intravenous analgesics but transitioned to oral pain medications as tolerated. Their vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period, and the surgical wound healed satisfactorily.

Although the patient had an unremarkable postoperative course overall, it is worth mentioning that they experienced some respiratory distress in the immediate postoperative period. This was likely due to their underlying obesity and smoking history. However, with close monitoring, supplemental oxygen, and the use of incentive spirometry, the patient's respiratory symptoms gradually improved. They were discharged home on postoperative day 3 without any further complications.
