He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are well-controlled with medication. The patient does not have any known allergies. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

Further review of his history reveals that the patient had a myocardial infarction four years ago, in which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting of the left anterior descending artery. He has been adherent to his cardiac medications since then, including aspirin, a beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and a statin. The recent stress test showed good exercise tolerance without any ischemic changes.

In addition to his heart condition, the patient has a history of chronic back pain and osteoarthritis in his knees. He regularly sees a chiropractor and a physical therapist for these issues. He is not currently taking any narcotics for pain management.

The patient's preoperative laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7,000/μL, and a platelet count of 200,000/μL. His renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate of 90 mL/min.

Regarding his surgical history, the patient had a cholecystectomy seven years ago without any complications. He has never received any blood products in the past. There is no family history of bleeding disorders or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient's surgical procedure is scheduled for next week, and he has been advised to discontinue his aspirin five days before the surgery. The anesthesia team will be updated about his cardiac history, and necessary precautions will be taken during the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He did not experience any major complications, such as infection, wound dehiscence, or excessive bleeding. Pain control was managed with non-narcotic analgesics, and he was able to ambulate on the second postoperative day without any difficulty.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled with his surgeon and primary care physician to monitor his progress. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three, with instructions for wound care and a plan to gradually resume normal activities. He was also informed to continue his regular medications as prescribed.
