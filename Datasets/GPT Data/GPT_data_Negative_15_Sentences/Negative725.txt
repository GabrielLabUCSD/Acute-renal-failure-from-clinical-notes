She has been on medications including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for her hypertension and metformin for her diabetes.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 10 years ago due to gallstone disease. The procedure was uneventful, and she recovered well without any complications. There were no postoperative infections or wound complications.

The patient's preoperative evaluation reveals that her blood pressure and blood sugar levels are under control. Her body mass index (BMI) is 31, and her pulmonary function tests are within normal limits. She does not have any known drug allergies and her renal function is stable.

The surgery scheduled is an elective knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. The patient has been experiencing chronic pain and limited mobility due to her knee condition. She has tried conservative management including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without significant improvement.

The patient's surgical team has discussed the risks and benefits of the knee replacement surgery with her, including the possibility of infection, blood loss, and the need for rehabilitation.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for vital signs and pain control. She was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. Physical therapy was initiated on the day of surgery, focusing on pain management and early mobilization. Her pain was well controlled with a combination of intravenous and oral pain medications.

The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated. She did not experience any signs of infection, such as fever or wound drainage. She was able to tolerate a regular diet and her blood sugar levels remained stable without the need for adjustment in her diabetes medications. Her blood pressure also remained within her target range.

The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day. She was provided with instructions for activity restrictions and wound care. Outpatient physical therapy and follow-up appointments were scheduled to ensure proper rehabilitation.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful and without complications. The knee replacement surgery improved her pain and mobility, allowing her to resume her daily activities with greater ease.
