The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery due to severe osteoarthritis in his right knee. He has a history of hypertension and is currently taking lisinopril to manage his blood pressure. The patient has had two previous surgeries, including a hernia repair five years ago and a tonsillectomy during childhood. He has no known allergies to any medications.

His preoperative evaluation revealed that the patient is a nonsmoker and does not consume alcohol regularly. However, he reported occasional social drinking. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 72 beats per minute. Laboratory tests revealed normal hemoglobin levels, liver function tests, and coagulation profile.

During surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and the procedure proceeded without any complications. The surgical team successfully performed a total knee replacement on the patient's right knee, removing the damaged joint surfaces and replacing them with a prosthetic device. The surgery took approximately two hours, and the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild to moderate pain, which was managed with a combination of oral analgesics and intravenous opioids. He was also prescribed prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence.

Over the next few days, the patient gradually regained mobility and underwent physical therapy to facilitate his recovery. He was closely monitored for signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and was prescribed prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent these complications. His pain gradually subsided, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet.

The patient's postoperative course was overall uneventful, and he was discharged home on day five after surgery. He was provided with instructions for wound care, pain management, and follow-up appointments. The patient was advised to continue his blood pressure medication and to report any signs of infection, excessive pain, or swelling to his healthcare provider.

During the follow-up visit two weeks after discharge, the patient reported a significant improvement in pain and mobility. The surgical wound was healing well without any signs of infection. X-rays of the knee revealed proper alignment of the prosthesis. The patient did not experience any complications during the postoperative period.
