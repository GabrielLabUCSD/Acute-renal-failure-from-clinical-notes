The patient, a 55-year-old female, presented to the clinic with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. She has been managing her blood pressure with a combination of antihypertensive medications and has a recorded average blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Her diabetes is controlled through diet and exercise with a recent HbA1c level of 6.8%. 

She has a past surgical history significant for a cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago without any complications. Last year, she underwent a total knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis, during which she had an uneventful perioperative course and an uncomplicated recovery. She is currently scheduled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to recurrent episodes of biliary colic and gallstones.

Her baseline laboratory investigations show normal liver function tests with no evidence of hepatobiliary dysfunction. She has a normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73 m².

The patient is a nonsmoker and denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse. Her BMI is within the normal range at 24 kg/m². She has no known drug allergies. She takes metformin for her diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and occasional over-the-counter pain medication for knee pain.

In preparation for surgery, the patient will be advised to discontinue metformin 24 hours prior to the procedure to minimize the risk of lactic acidosis. She will be assessed by an anesthesiologist to evaluate her fitness for anesthesia. She will also be instructed to follow the preoperative fasting guidelines.

Regarding her postoperative course, the patient is expected to have an uneventful recovery. She will be closely monitored for pain control, surgical site infection, and any signs of postoperative complications. Appropriate analgesics will be prescribed to manage her pain and prevent deep vein thrombosis. She will be encouraged to ambulate early post-surgery to prevent complications and to aid in a prompt recovery.

Complications post-cholecystectomy can include bile leak, wound infection, bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia. However, acute renal failure is not anticipated as a common complication in this type of surgery. Precautions will be taken to minimize the risk of adverse events and optimize her postoperative outcome. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to assess her overall recovery and to address any concerns.
