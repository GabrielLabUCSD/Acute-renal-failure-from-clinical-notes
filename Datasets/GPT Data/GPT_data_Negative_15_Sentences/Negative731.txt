Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old male who presented to the hospital for evaluation of chronic knee pain and stiffness. He has a history of osteoarthritis, which had progressively worsened over the past five years. Non-surgical management including physical therapy, analgesics, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections were unsuccessful in providing long-term relief.

In addition to his knee pain, Mr. Smith also has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He has never been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and does not have a family history of the disease. His blood pressure on admission was 128/78 mmHg.

As part of his preoperative workup, Mr. Smith underwent a comprehensive physical examination, including laboratory investigations. His blood work revealed normal complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests. His American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification was determined to be Class II.

Due to the severity of his symptoms and the failure of conservative management, Mr. Smith was scheduled for total knee replacement surgery. He is aware of the risks involved, including infection, thromboembolism, and anesthesia-related complications.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and no intraoperative complications were encountered. The surgeon successfully replaced the knee joint, and the postoperative recovery was uneventful. Mr. Smith was started on a postoperative pain management regimen consisting of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

In the postoperative period, Mr. Smith was closely monitored for any signs of infection, clotting disorders, or postoperative bleeding. His vital signs remained stable, and his wound healed without any signs of infection. He underwent physical therapy to regain strength and range of motion in his knee joint.

During his hospital stay, Mr. Smith experienced mild constipation, which was managed with stool softeners and increased fluid intake. There were no signs of respiratory distress, cardiac complications, or neurological deficits.

On the third postoperative day, Mr. Smith was discharged from the hospital with instructions for continued pain management, wound care, and physical therapy. He was also advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine postoperative monitoring and management of his hypertension.

Overall, Mr. Smith had a successful total knee replacement surgery without any major complications. He is expected to recover well and achieve improved function, mobility, and quality of life in the long term.
