The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with complaints of chronic knee pain affecting his ability to carry out daily activities. He has a medical history of osteoarthritis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The knee pain has been progressively worsening over the past few years despite conservative management with physical therapy and analgesics.

Clinical examination revealed marked tenderness, swelling, and restricted range of motion in the affected knee. Radiographic evaluation confirmed severe degenerative joint disease with significant loss of joint space and osteophyte formation. Considering the patient's significant functional limitation and failure of non-operative measures, surgical intervention in the form of a total knee replacement was recommended.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a detailed medical evaluation, including thorough laboratory tests. His blood pressure was well-controlled with antihypertensive medications, and his blood glucose levels were within normal range on oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient has no reported medication allergies. However, he is a current smoker, with a long history of smoking one pack per day.

The patient was informed about the potential risks and benefits of surgery, including the possibility of infection, blood loss, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Preoperative counseling also emphasized the importance of smoking cessation to enhance postoperative healing and minimize complications.

Surgical intervention was carried out successfully under general anesthesia, with a standard total knee replacement procedure. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered. Intraoperatively, no major complications were encountered, and adequate pain control was achieved with a combination of opioids and regional anesthesia techniques.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, wound healing, and signs of infection. Adequate pain management was achieved with a multimodal regimen, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and physical therapy. Early mobilization and physiotherapy were initiated to accelerate recovery and restore the functional range of motion.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any major postoperative complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. However, he did develop a transient elevation in blood glucose levels, which was managed with adjustments to his antidiabetic medications. The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful, and his knee pain significantly improved over time.

In conclusion, the patient underwent successful total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. He had a complicated medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a smoking habit. Despite these risk factors, the patient had a smooth postoperative course without any major complications. He experienced transient hyperglycemia, which was managed effectively. The surgical intervention resulted in significant improvement in knee pain and function, allowing the patient to resume his daily activities with greater ease.
