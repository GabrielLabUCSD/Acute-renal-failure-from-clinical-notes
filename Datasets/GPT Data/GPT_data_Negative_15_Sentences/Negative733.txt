The patient is a 55-year-old female who presented to the clinic with complaints of severe knee pain. She has a medical history significant for osteoarthritis in both knees, for which she has been managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy. However, conservative measures have failed to provide adequate relief, and therefore, the decision for surgical intervention has been made.

On further assessment, it was revealed that the patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril 10 mg daily. She also suffers from type 2 diabetes mellitus, maintaining glycemic control with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. In addition, the patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which she takes atorvastatin 20 mg daily.

Lab results demonstrated stable renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's hemoglobin A1c level was within target range at 6.7%. Electrocardiogram revealed no significant abnormalities, and a recent stress test was negative for ischemic changes.

The patient was counseled regarding the surgical procedure, including potential risks such as infection, bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Preoperatively, she was advised to discontinue her NSAID use and was provided with instructions for perioperative glycemic control and medication management.

The surgery was performed smoothly, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperatively, she was started on prophylactic low molecular weight heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Her pain was effectively managed with a combination of opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

During the postoperative period, the patient had an uneventful recovery. She was closely monitored for signs of infection, such as fever or wound drainage, and her wounds were healing satisfactorily. Physical therapy was initiated early to aid in the recovery process.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3. She was provided with clear instructions for self-care and wound management, as well as pain management strategies. She was advised to continue her medication regimen and to follow up with her primary care physician for routine monitoring of her chronic conditions.

To date, the patient has not reported any complications related to the surgical procedure. Her pain has improved significantly, and after a few weeks of physical therapy, she has regained functional mobility. The patient is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and is looking forward to resuming her normal activities.
