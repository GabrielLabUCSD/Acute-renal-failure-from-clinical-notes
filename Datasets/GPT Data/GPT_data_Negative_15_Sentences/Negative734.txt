The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a significant past medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He had a myocardial infarction two years ago for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. He also has a history of osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain.

His current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and aspirin. He has been compliant with his medications and his blood pressure and blood glucose levels are well controlled. He quit smoking five years ago but has a history of heavy smoking in the past.

On physical examination, his vital signs are stable, and no significant abnormalities are noted. His cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, and his lung sounds are clear. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. He has mild tenderness in the lower back region with limited range of motion due to osteoarthritis.

Laboratory investigations show normal blood counts, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. His HbA1c is within the target range, indicating good glycemic control. An electrocardiogram reveals no acute changes, and his echocardiogram shows a preserved ejection fraction with no significant valvular abnormalities.

The patient meets with the anesthesiologist prior to surgery for evaluation and is deemed fit for anesthesia. He is advised to continue his medications on the day of surgery with a sip of water. Preoperative counseling is provided, and the patient expresses understanding and consent for the procedure.

The patient undergoes surgery without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he is closely monitored in the recovery room and is stable. He is started on postoperative pain management protocols and is encouraged to ambulate as tolerated. The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with adequate pain control and resolution of surgical site discomfort.

He is discharged two days after surgery with appropriate follow-up instructions. During the follow-up visit, the patient reports mild surgical site pain, which is managed with analgesics. He continues to progress well and is encouraged to engage in physical therapy for his osteoarthritis and back pain.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course is uncomplicated. He adheres to recommended lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and a healthy diet, to manage his hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is advised to quit smoking entirely to reduce his risk of future cardiovascular events. Close monitoring of his cardiovascular risk factors and medication adherence is recommended to prevent further complications.
