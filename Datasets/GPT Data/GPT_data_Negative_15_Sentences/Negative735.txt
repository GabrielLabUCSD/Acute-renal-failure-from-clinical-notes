The patient in question is a 58-year-old female who has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She is planning to undergo surgery for a knee replacement due to severe degenerative joint disease. Her medical history includes a previous gastric bypass surgery for weight loss and she currently takes medications for her hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation including routine blood work, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray. Her blood work showed well-controlled diabetes and cholesterol levels within normal limits. Her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and her chest X-ray was unremarkable.

During her surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and the knee replacement procedure was performed without any complications. She was closely monitored for blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation throughout the surgery. Her vital signs remained stable and she tolerated the procedure well.

Postoperatively, the patient was initially managed in the recovery room where she was closely observed for any signs of pain, infection, or complications. She was started on a routine postoperative pain management regimen with opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical therapy was initiated on the day of surgery to aid in mobilization and promote early ambulation.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of surgical site infection or wound complications. Her pain was well-controlled with medication and she was able to tolerate oral intake without any issues. Her vital signs remained stable, and her blood glucose levels were closely monitored to ensure proper glycemic control.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any potential surgical site infections. She was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and follow a regimen of gradual mobilization to minimize the risk of blood clots.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on day four post-surgery with a referral for outpatient physical therapy. She was educated on proper wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions during her recovery period. The patient was provided with a seven-day course of prophylactic antibiotics and a follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks to assess her progress.

In summary, the patient successfully underwent knee replacement surgery without any complications. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she did not experience any acute renal failure. The patient was discharged with appropriate instructions for home care and scheduled follow-up to ensure continued healing and rehabilitation.
