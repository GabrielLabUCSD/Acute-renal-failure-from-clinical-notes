The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and stable coronary artery disease. He presented with significant knee pain due to severe osteoarthritis and has decided to undergo total knee arthroplasty. 

His diabetes is well-controlled with metformin 1000 mg twice daily, and his blood pressure is also well-managed on a combination of lisinopril 20 mg daily and amlodipine 10 mg daily. He takes atorvastatin 40 mg daily for his hyperlipidemia and has achieved adequate control with his recent lipid panel results within normal limits. 

The patient's coronary artery disease is stable, and he had undergone a cardiac catheterization one year ago that did not reveal any significant blockages. He has been prescribed low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily as primary prevention. 

He is a former smoker, having quit two years ago, and has a 20-pack-year smoking history. He has no current respiratory symptoms and oxygen saturation levels within normal limits. 

The patient underwent surgery without any complications and tolerated the procedure well. He received prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively as per the surgical protocol and his blood glucose levels were closely monitored during the surgery. 

Postoperatively, the patient was initially provided with patient-controlled analgesia for pain management, which was transitioned to oral opioids as his pain improved. He was also started on subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.

The patient had a smooth postoperative course, with no signs of infection or wound issues. He was able to ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy and was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3.

During his follow-up appointments, the patient exhibited good wound healing and was gradually weaned off opioids for pain control. His blood glucose levels remained stable with his usual antidiabetic medication regimen. 

He was instructed to continue with physical therapy and functional rehabilitation exercises to improve his knee strength and range of motion.

The patient did not experience any complications during his recovery period and was able to return to his daily activities without any limitations. He reported overall satisfaction with the surgery outcome and improvement in knee pain and mobility. 

Follow-up appointments were scheduled at regular intervals to monitor his progress and assess for any signs of postoperative complications. At the last follow-up, six months after surgery, the patient continued to do well with no complications identified.
