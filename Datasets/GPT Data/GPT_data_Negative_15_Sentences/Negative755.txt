The patient is a 55-year-old female with a significant medical history who is planning to have surgery. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Her hypertension has been well controlled with lisinopril 10 mg daily, and her diabetes is managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She takes atorvastatin 20 mg daily for hyperlipidemia. The patient is a current smoker, with a 20-pack-year smoking history, and she has a history of bronchitis exacerbations requiring antibiotics and prednisone in the past.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone a cholecystectomy for gallstones and an elective knee arthroscopy for osteoarthritis. She tolerated both procedures well without any major complications. She has no known drug allergies.

On physical exam, the patient is overweight (BMI 30) with normal vital signs. Lung auscultation reveals mild expiratory wheezes bilaterally. She has no signs of peripheral edema and her abdomen is soft and nontender.

Preoperative laboratory studies show well-controlled blood glucose levels with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.9%. Lipid panel results are within normal limits. Renal function tests are within normal range, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's surgical procedure is planned to be an elective total knee replacement due to worsening knee pain and limitation of mobility. Throughout the postoperative course, the patient receives appropriate pain management and physical therapy. She exhibits good wound healing and is able to bear weight on her new knee within a few days post-surgery.

In terms of complications, the patient develops a superficial wound infection at the surgical site, likely due to her smoking history and compromised immune system. The infection is treated with a course of oral antibiotics and resolves without any further complications. The patient also experiences a transient episode of postoperative hypoxemia, likely related to her COPD, but responds well to supplemental oxygen therapy.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course is considered satisfactory, despite the minor complications mentioned. She is referred to pulmonary rehabilitation to improve her lung function and is advised to quit smoking to decrease the risk of future surgical complications.
