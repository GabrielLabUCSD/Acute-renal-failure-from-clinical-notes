The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well-controlled with medications. He is presenting for elective surgery for the removal of a benign mass in the right kidney. The patient has a BMI of 32, indicating he is overweight. He has no known drug allergies and his medical history is otherwise unremarkable.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent a complete physical examination which revealed no abnormalities. Preoperative laboratory studies showed normal liver function, renal function, and coagulation profile. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias.

The patient's surgical team discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with him and obtained informed consent. They also administered prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. The patient was instructed to discontinue oral anticoagulants prior to surgery and to take nothing by mouth after midnight on the day of surgery.

Following surgery, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for signs of postoperative complications. He received intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics as prescribed. The patient's vital signs remained stable, with no evidence of fever, tachycardia, or hypotension.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he experienced no complications such as surgical site infection, bleeding, or wound dehiscence. He reported adequate pain control with oral analgesics and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. The patient's renal function remained stable throughout the postoperative period.

During the hospital stay, the patient was encouraged to ambulate to prevent venous thromboembolism. He was also instructed on proper wound care and given information on potential signs and symptoms of infection or other complications to watch for at home.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three, with scheduled follow-up appointments to monitor the healing process. He was instructed to continue taking his regular medications and to gradually increase his activity level as tolerated. The patient was advised to contact his healthcare provider immediately if he experienced any concerning symptoms, such as persistent pain, fever, or significant changes in urinary output.

In summary, this 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia underwent elective surgery for the removal of a benign renal mass. His postoperative course was unremarkable, with no complications observed. The patient was discharged home in stable condition, with appropriate instructions for follow-up and self-monitoring.
