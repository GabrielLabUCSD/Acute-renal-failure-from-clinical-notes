The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He is being evaluated for surgery and has a planned procedure to alleviate a herniated disc in his lower back. The patient reports chronic lower back pain that radiates down his legs, and conservative treatment measures including physical therapy and pain medications have failed to provide long-term relief.

His preoperative workup included a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, all of which were within normal limits. His ECG showed old inferior wall myocardial infarction changes but no active ischemia. Preoperative chest X-ray demonstrated no significant abnormalities.

His surgical procedure went smoothly under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the surgeon noted a large herniation at the L4-L5 level, which was successfully decompressed and stabilized using a fusion technique. Throughout the procedure, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection.

During the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery area and then transferred to the floor. Pain control was managed with narcotic analgesics and nonpharmacological interventions, including physical therapy and ice packs. He was encouraged to walk with assistance on the first postoperative day to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. The patient remained hemodynamically stable, and his incision site appeared well-healing without signs of infection.

Following surgery, the patient experienced some postoperative discomfort but reported a significant reduction in his radiating leg pain. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with instructions for gradual resumption of normal activities and a prescription for oral pain medications.

No complications were noted during the patient's postoperative course, and he had no evidence of wound infection, respiratory distress, or neurological deficits. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and spine surgeon in two weeks for a routine postoperative visit. Instructions for wound care, medication management, and pain control were reiterated during the discharge discussion, and the patient was provided with contact information for any concerns or questions that may arise.
