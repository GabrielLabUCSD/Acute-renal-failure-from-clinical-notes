Patient X is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He presents to the hospital planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. The patient reports experiencing intermittent abdominal pain and discomfort for the past six months, which has become progressively worse in the last few weeks. He states that the pain is relieved by lying down and exacerbated by activities like lifting heavy objects.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily, and his diabetes is managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He does not have any known drug allergies and reports no history of significant surgeries or hospitalizations. His family history is positive for coronary artery disease; his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 80 beats per minute. The physical examination reveals a reducible inguinal hernia on the right side. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function, are within normal limits. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 80 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient is scheduled for elective surgery, and appropriate preoperative counseling and consent are obtained. He is advised to discontinue taking his metformin 48 hours before the procedure, following confirmed renal function and consultation with his primary care physician. He is also instructed to refrain from eating or drinking anything for eight hours before the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient is monitored in the surgical ward. He receives intravenous fluids initially and advances to a regular diet as tolerated. His vital signs remain stable, and there are no signs of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence. He is encouraged to ambulate, and his pain is managed with oral analgesics.

Throughout his postoperative course, the patient maintains good glycemic control, with fasting blood glucose levels ranging from 90 to 120 mg/dL. His blood pressure remains within the target range, and there are no signs of hypotension or orthostatic changes.

The patient's recovery progresses well, with no reported complications. He is discharged two days after the surgery with appropriate instructions for wound care, follow-up appointments, and pain management. The patient is advised to gradually increase his physical activity, avoid heavy lifting, and monitor his blood glucose levels regularly. He is provided with a prescription for oral analgesics for breakthrough pain.

Overall, patient X's surgery for hernia repair proceeds smoothly without any complications. His postoperative recovery is uneventful, and he is expected to resume his normal activities within a few weeks.
