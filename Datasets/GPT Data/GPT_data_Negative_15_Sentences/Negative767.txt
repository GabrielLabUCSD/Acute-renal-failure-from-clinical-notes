The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. He is scheduled to undergo an elective surgery for correction of a hernia. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications, including lisinopril and amlodipine, for the past 5 years. His blood pressure has been well controlled with these medications.

The patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 for the past 10 years. He has been managing his blood sugar levels with oral medications such as metformin and glipizide. His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels have been within the target range of 6-7% for the past year.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. He has been struggling with weight management and has tried various weight loss strategies, including diet and exercise modifications, but has been unsuccessful in achieving significant weight loss.

The patient underwent a preoperative evaluation, which included a thorough physical examination, blood tests, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). All results were within normal limits except for a mildly elevated fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL.

In preparation for surgery, the patient was advised to continue his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications as prescribed, with the exception of metformin, which was temporarily discontinued 24 hours prior to surgery. He was also instructed to fast for 8 hours prior to surgery.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no intraoperative complications reported. The hernia repair was successful, and the surgeon noted normal tissue healing and no evidence of infection.

Postoperatively, the patient was started on a regular diet once his bowel function returned. His blood pressure was monitored closely, and his antihypertensive medications were resumed as per the preoperative regimen. Blood glucose levels were also monitored, and the patient's oral antidiabetic medications were restarted.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of wound complications such as infection or dehiscence. He was mobilized within 24 hours of surgery and had adequate pain control with analgesics. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay, and he did not require any further interventions or treatments.

Overall, the patient's postoperative recovery was smooth, and he was discharged in satisfactory condition. He was provided with appropriate discharge instructions, including wound care and medication management. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his chronic conditions.

No significant complications were reported during the patient's postoperative course. The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose control remained stable throughout, indicating successful management of his hypertension and diabetes during the surgical procedure.
