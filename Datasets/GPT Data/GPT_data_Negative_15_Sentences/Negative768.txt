The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair in the inguinal region.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has never had any prior surgeries and has no family history of adverse reactions to anesthesia or complications related to surgical procedures. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and coagulation studies, which were all within normal limits. He was also assessed by the anesthesiologist and deemed suitable for general anesthesia.

The patient was instructed to fast for 8 hours before surgery and was given preoperative medications to ensure proper anesthesia and pain management during and after the procedure. He was also educated about postoperative care and expected recovery time.

The surgery was performed successfully without any complications. The patient received general anesthesia and was monitored closely throughout the procedure. The surgeon repaired the hernia using a mesh prosthesis, and the procedure lasted approximately 1 hour.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where he was monitored for vital signs, pain level, and signs of complications. His recovery was uneventful, and he reported minimal pain, which was effectively managed with analgesics.

The patient was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet on the same day of surgery and progressed to a regular diet the following day. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises. The surgical site was examined regularly, and there were no signs of infection or wound dehiscence.

The patient's postoperative course was smooth, and he was discharged home on the third day after surgery. He was prescribed pain medications and instructed to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next 4-6 weeks. The surgeon provided clear instructions for wound care, including keeping the incision site clean and dry.

During the follow-up visit one week later, the patient was doing well, with no signs of complications such as infection, bleeding, or recurrence of the hernia. He reported minimal pain and was gradually transitioning back to his regular activities of daily living.

In summary, the patient, a 65-year-old male, underwent successful surgery for a hernia repair without any complications. His preoperative management was optimal, and he received appropriate postoperative care, resulting in a smooth recovery.
