The patient is a 60-year-old female who is planning to undergo surgery for the removal of a benign ovarian tumor. She has a past medical history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medications. She also has a history of hyperthyroidism, for which she underwent radioiodine ablation two years ago and is currently euthyroid on levothyroxine therapy.

The patient has a family history of breast cancer, but she has never been diagnosed with it herself. She underwent a bilateral mammogram six months ago, which was negative for any abnormalities. Her most recent Pap smear two years ago was normal.

The patient has a BMI of 30, classifying her as obese, and has been struggling with weight management for several years. She does not have any known allergies and states that she does not smoke or consume alcohol.

Her preoperative laboratory workup revealed a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 8.5 x 10^9/L, and a platelet count of 220 x 10^9/L. Her renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 70 mL/min/1.73m^2. 

The patient's preoperative electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities. An echocardiogram done three months ago demonstrated normal left ventricular function.

She met with the anesthesiologist prior to surgery and was deemed fit for general anesthesia. The anesthesiologist noted that her airway appeared normal, and her lungs were clear on auscultation.

Postoperatively, the patient's recovery was uneventful. She experienced mild postoperative pain, which was well-controlled with analgesic medications. She was able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulate independently within 24 hours of surgery.

The surgical pathology report confirmed the benign nature of the ovarian tumor. No intraoperative complications were noted, and the surgical incision site healed well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient did not develop any postoperative respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated and she was discharged home on postoperative day 3 in stable condition. She was advised to follow up with her primary care physician for a routine postoperative visit in two weeks and to continue her regular medications.
