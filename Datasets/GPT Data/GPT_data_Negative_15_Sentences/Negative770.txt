Patient X, a 55-year-old male, is planning to undergo surgery for the removal of a benign tumor in the liver. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed 10 years ago. The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled on lisinopril 20 mg daily. He is also on atorvastatin 40 mg daily to manage his elevated lipid levels.

Patient X has a BMI of 32 and is considered obese. He has been struggling with weight management and has been advised to go on a low-carbohydrate diet. His recent hemoglobin A1c level was measured at 7.2%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control.

In terms of cardiovascular health, the patient had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago, which was managed medically. He is currently on aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for secondary prevention. His stress test performed 2 months ago showed evidence of mild reversible ischemia, and he is scheduled for a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after the liver surgery.

Patient X has no known allergies to medications, and his preoperative laboratory results revealed normal renal function. The patient has a history of smoking, but he quit 10 years ago and denies any recent alcohol or illicit substance use. He expressed compliance with preoperative fasting requirements.

During his postoperative course, Patient X tolerated the surgery well. He was closely monitored in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours and was subsequently transferred to the surgical floor. Analgesia was managed effectively with patient-controlled intravenous opioids and non-opioid medications.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period, and his pain was well controlled. He adhered to postoperative activity limitations and received prophylactic measures to prevent deep vein thrombosis, such as sequential compression devices and low molecular weight heparin.

Patient X did not experience any complications during his postoperative course, and there were no signs of surgical site infection. He was started on oral intake gradually and resumed his home medications. His blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and adjustments were made to his diabetes medications to maintain optimal glycemic control.

Postoperatively, the patient's renal function remained stable, and there were no signs of acute renal failure. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled for wound checks, medication adjustments, and coordination with the interventional cardiologist for the upcoming PCI procedure. Patient X was counseled on lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation and weight loss, to improve his overall health and reduce the risk of future complications.
