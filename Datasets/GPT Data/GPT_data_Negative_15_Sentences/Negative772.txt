The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is a non-smoker and has a body mass index of 30. The patient is currently on metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin for his medical conditions.

The patient is scheduled for surgery due to a degenerative joint disease of the left knee, which has caused significant pain and functional impairment. The patient has tried conservative management with physical therapy and pain medications but without significant improvement.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his blood work showed well-controlled diabetes and lipid levels within normal limits. His renal function tests were also normal, ruling out any pre-existing renal impairment.

The patient was advised to stop taking metformin prior to surgery, due to the risk of lactic acidosis in the setting of renal insufficiency or contrast administration. He was instructed to continue taking his lisinopril and atorvastatin up until the day of surgery.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with stable vital signs throughout. Postoperatively, the patient was started on a pain management regimen consisting of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for signs of infection, such as wound redness, swelling, or fever. He was also encouraged to ambulate with assistance from the physical therapy team to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications related to the surgery or anesthesia. His pain was well-controlled with the prescribed medications, and he demonstrated steady improvement in physical function during his hospital stay.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with instructions for wound care, pain management, and physical therapy. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and rehabilitation.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, and he had a smooth recovery without any major complications. He is expected to regain full function of his left knee with the help of physical therapy and appropriate follow-up care.
