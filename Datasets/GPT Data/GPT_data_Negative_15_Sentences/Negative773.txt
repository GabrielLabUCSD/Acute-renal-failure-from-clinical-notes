The patient is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to have surgery. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He has been on a combination of medications including lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and aspirin.

The patient has a history of multiple cardiac events in the past. He has previously undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. He also had a myocardial infarction five years ago, for which he received thrombolytic therapy.

In addition to his cardiac history, the patient has had a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and stable angina. He has been managed conservatively with medication and lifestyle modifications.

The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease stage 3, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 ml/min/1.73m². His renal function has been stable over the past year, and he has not required dialysis.

The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. He has a sedentary lifestyle and has struggled with maintaining a healthy weight.

In preparation for surgery, the patient has undergone a preoperative assessment, including a comprehensive physical examination, routine blood work, and an electrocardiogram. He has been deemed fit for surgery by the anesthesiologist and cleared for the procedure by his cardiologist.

Following the surgery, the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He initially experienced mild pain and discomfort, which was effectively managed with analgesics. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was gradually able to resume his normal activities.

There were no signs of infection or wound dehiscence during the postoperative period. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not require any additional interventions or procedures.

Although the patient did not experience any complications immediately after the surgery, he did have a delayed recovery of kidney function. His eGFR decreased to 35 ml/min/1.73m² in the postoperative period, necessitating close monitoring of his renal function and adjustment of medication dosages.

Overall, the patient's surgery went well, and he was discharged from the hospital in a stable condition. He was advised to continue his regular medications, follow up with his cardiologist for further evaluation of his renal function, and adhere to a healthy lifestyle.
