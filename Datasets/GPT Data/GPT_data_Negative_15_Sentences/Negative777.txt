This is a patient summary for a patient planning to have surgery. The patient is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on a stable medication regimen for these conditions including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin.

The patient has a history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day for the past 25 years but quit smoking 6 months ago. He denies any current respiratory symptoms. The patient also reports a history of occasional alcohol use, with no significant binge drinking episodes.

On physical examination, the patient has a body mass index of 28 and his blood pressure is well controlled at 130/80 mmHg. His lungs are clear to auscultation and he has no signs of peripheral edema. A cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or gallops.

Laboratory results show a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%. His lipid panel reveals a total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL and a LDL cholesterol of 140 mg/dL.

The patient is scheduled to undergo an elective cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. He has been thoroughly counseled regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient recovers well with no immediate complications. He is started on a regular diet and is able to tolerate it without any issues. Pain is well controlled with oral narcotic analgesics. The patient is ambulating independently and his incision site shows signs of appropriate healing.

However, on the second postoperative day, the patient develops a fever with a temperature of 101Â°F. Blood cultures are obtained and a broad-spectrum antibiotic is initiated due to suspicion of surgical site infection. The patient's fever resolves within 48 hours and the blood cultures do not grow any organisms.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course goes well with successful recovery from the surgery. He is discharged home with appropriate wound care instructions and a plan for close follow-up with his primary care physician. No acute renal failure was observed as a complication during the entire postoperative period.
