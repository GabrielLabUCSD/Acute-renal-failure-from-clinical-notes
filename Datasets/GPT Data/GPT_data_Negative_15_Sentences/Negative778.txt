Patient Summary:

This is a patient who is planning to undergo surgery. The patient has a medical history that includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and mild chronic kidney disease (stage 2). They are currently on medications for blood pressure control and blood sugar management. The patient has a history of smoking but has quit for the past five years. They have no known drug allergies.

The patient's preoperative evaluation revealed overall stable vital signs, with blood pressure averaging around 130/80 mmHg. Their fasting blood sugar levels have been consistently within the target range for their diabetes management. The patient's kidney function tests show a mild decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate but without any signs of worsening or acute kidney injury. Their baseline laboratory investigations are otherwise within normal limits.

During the preoperative optimization process, the patient's blood pressure medications were continued. An anesthesiology consult recommended careful monitoring during the procedure due to the patient's history of hypertension. Additionally, the patient was advised on strict glycemic control before and after the surgery to minimize the risk of hyper or hypoglycemia.

After the surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Their vital signs remained stable, without any episodes of significant hypertension or hypotension. Blood sugar levels were carefully monitored and managed with insulin as necessary to maintain euglycemia. The patient was kept on a close watch for any postoperative complications, including infections or signs of acute kidney injury.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any complications during the postoperative period. They were regularly assessed for wound healing, pain control, and functional recovery. Additionally, the patient was counseled on post-surgical care, including the importance of proper nutrition, weight management, and regular follow-up visits. The patient showed good compliance with the prescribed medications and postoperative instructions.

In summary, this patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and mild chronic kidney disease is planning to undergo surgery. Their preoperative evaluation revealed stable vital signs, well-controlled blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful without any complications. The patient received careful monitoring and management of vital signs, blood sugar levels, and wound healing.
