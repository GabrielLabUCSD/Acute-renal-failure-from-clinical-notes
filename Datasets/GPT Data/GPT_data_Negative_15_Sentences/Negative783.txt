The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.
She has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years and insulin for her diabetes for the past 5 years.
Her blood pressure has been well controlled, with readings consistently around 130/80 mmHg, and her HbA1c levels have been stable at 7.0.
She has a history of osteoarthritis in her knees, for which she has been taking over-the-counter pain medications as needed.
The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly.
She has no known drug allergies and has never had any previous surgeries.
The patient has been advised to undergo a total knee replacement surgery due to severe joint pain and limited mobility.
Preoperative tests including blood work, ECG, and chest X-ray have been performed, all of which were within normal limits.
The patient underwent successful knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively, she was started on pain medication, physical therapy, and early mobilization.
She developed a superficial wound infection at the surgical site, which was treated with antibiotics and wound care.
The patient's recovery was otherwise uneventful, with good pain control and gradual improvement in her knee function.
She was discharged home after a 3-day hospital stay and instructed to continue physical therapy as an outpatient.
At her follow-up appointment, the wound infection had resolved, and the patient reported significant improvement in her knee pain and mobility.
Overall, despite the minor complication of a wound infection, the patient's postoperative course was successful, and she is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery.
