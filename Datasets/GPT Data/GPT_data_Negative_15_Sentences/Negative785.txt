The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, well-controlled with medications. He has a past surgical history of an appendectomy 20 years ago and a cholecystectomy 10 years ago without any complications. His current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.

He presents with symptoms of cholecystitis and is scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preoperative labs show normal kidney function with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m². His blood pressure is stable, and his fasting blood sugar levels are within the normal range.

The patient undergoes the cholecystectomy without any intraoperative complications and is discharged home on the same day. Postoperatively, he follows up with his surgeon and reports mild incisional pain, which is managed with acetaminophen. He is advised to resume his normal diet and activities gradually.

During the first two weeks postop, the patient develops a surgical site infection, which is treated with a course of oral antibiotics. He also experiences some mild gastrointestinal upset, likely due to the changes in his diet post-surgery. The patient is monitored closely, and his symptoms gradually improve with conservative management.

At the one-month follow-up visit, the patient's incisions have healed well, and there are no signs of infection. His kidney function remains within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL and an eGFR of 92 mL/min/1.73m². Overall, despite the minor complications, the patient has recovered well from the surgery and is satisfied with the outcome.
