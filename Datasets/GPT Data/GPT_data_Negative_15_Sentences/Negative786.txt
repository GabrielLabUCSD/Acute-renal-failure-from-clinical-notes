The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years and takes oral hypoglycemic agents to manage his diabetes. His BMI is 35, and he has a history of smoking 1 pack per day for the past 20 years, but quit 5 years ago.

The patient is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a hernia repair. Preoperatively, he underwent a thorough evaluation by his primary care physician and a cardiologist to assess his cardiovascular risk. He was found to have well-controlled hypertension and no evidence of coronary artery disease on stress testing.

During the surgery, the patient was monitored closely by the anesthesia team, and the procedure was completed without any intraoperative complications. He received appropriate perioperative antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient recovered well from anesthesia and was stable hemodynamically. He was started on a clear liquid diet and encouraged to ambulate to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis.

The patient was closely monitored for postoperative pain control and was managed with a combination of acetaminophen and opioid medications. His diabetes was closely monitored, and his glucose levels were well controlled with insulin therapy.

On the third postoperative day, the patient developed a low-grade fever, which was attributed to atelectasis. He was started on respiratory treatments and improved over the next 24 hours.

The patient's postoperative course was otherwise uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with instructions for wound care and a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. He was advised to resume his usual activities gradually, avoid heavy lifting, and continue his medications as prescribed.

Overall, the patient's surgery went well, and he had a successful recovery without any major complications. He was satisfied with the care he received and expressed gratitude for the thorough evaluation and management by his healthcare team.
