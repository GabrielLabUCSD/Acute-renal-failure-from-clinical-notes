The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. He has been taking lisinopril for the hypertension and metformin for the diabetes. He also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a CPAP machine at night.

The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having had a heart attack at the age of 60. He is a lifelong smoker, with a 30 pack-year smoking history, but he has cut down significantly in the last year and is now smoking only a few cigarettes per day.

He has a sedentary lifestyle and does not engage in regular exercise. His BMI is 32, indicating obesity. He has a history of chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis in both knees. He has tried physical therapy and corticosteroid injections in the past, but has not found long-lasting relief.

The patient is scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery due to the severe osteoarthritis in his right knee. He has had multiple consultations with the orthopedic surgeon and has completed all preoperative testing, including blood work and imaging studies. He has been counseled on the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for infection, blood clots, and postoperative pain.

Following the surgery, the patient experienced moderate postoperative pain, which was managed with a combination of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He developed some swelling and bruising in the operated knee, which is expected after this type of surgery. He participated in physical therapy sessions to regain strength and range of motion in the knee.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any major complications postoperatively. His incision site healed well without any signs of infection. He was monitored closely for signs of blood clots, but none were detected. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 and continued physical therapy as an outpatient. At his follow-up appointments, he showed steady progress in his recovery and was pleased with the outcome of the surgery.
