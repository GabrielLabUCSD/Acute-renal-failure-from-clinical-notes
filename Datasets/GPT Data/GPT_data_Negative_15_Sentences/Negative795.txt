The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managed with medications for the past 10 years and has been relatively stable.

He also has a past surgical history of a cholecystectomy 15 years ago without any complications. The patient has a body mass index of 32 and a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 5 years ago.

He presented with worsening knee pain due to osteoarthritis and is scheduled for a total knee replacement surgery. His preoperative evaluation revealed good cardiac function with no history of heart disease or arrhythmias.

The patient was counseled on the risks and benefits of surgery, including potential complications such as infection, blood clots, and delayed wound healing. He was cleared by the anesthesia team for surgery.

During the postoperative course, the patient developed a wound infection requiring a course of antibiotics. However, the infection was successfully treated, and the wound healed without any further complications.

The patient was monitored closely for signs of blood clots and received appropriate prophylaxis. Physical therapy was started early to facilitate his recovery and improve his mobility.

Despite the wound infection, the patient's overall recovery was satisfactory, and he was able to regain function in his knee without any long-term consequences. He was discharged home with instructions for wound care and rehabilitation exercises.

The patient will be followed up in the clinic in 2 weeks for wound assessment and monitoring of his progress. He was instructed to continue physical therapy and take all prescribed medications.

Overall, despite the minor complication of a wound infection, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery and is expected to have improved quality of life and mobility.
