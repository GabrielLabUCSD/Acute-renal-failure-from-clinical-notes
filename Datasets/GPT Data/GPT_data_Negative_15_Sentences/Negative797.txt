Postoperatively, the patient had a course complicated by surgical site infection, requiring a course of antibiotics. She developed mild postoperative delirium, which resolved with supportive care and close monitoring. Her pain was managed with a combination of opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

The patient's diabetes was closely monitored during her hospital stay, with adjustments made to her insulin regimen to maintain blood glucose levels within target range. She developed transient perioperative anemia, which was managed with iron supplementation.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful, and she was discharged home with a plan for physical therapy and close follow-up with her orthopedic surgeon.
