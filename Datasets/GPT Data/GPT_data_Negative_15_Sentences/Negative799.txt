The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He has been on medications for the last 10 years to control his blood pressure and blood sugar levels. The patient also had a previous surgical history of a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 5 years ago.

He presents with symptoms of angina and shortness of breath on exertion, prompting the need for surgery. Preoperatively, the patient underwent thorough cardiac evaluation including stress testing and echocardiogram to assess his cardiac function in preparation for the upcoming surgery. His surgical team involved a cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and a cardiac surgeon to ensure optimal care during the procedure.

The patient underwent successful surgery, and his postoperative course went smoothly without any immediate complications. He was closely monitored in the intensive care unit postoperatively for the first 24 hours before transferring to a regular surgical floor. The patient was started on a tailored pain management regimen to control postoperative pain and facilitate early mobilization.

Due to his history of diabetes, his blood sugar levels were closely monitored postoperatively to prevent any complications. Physical therapy was initiated early to prevent muscle weakness and promote a quicker recovery. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient began experiencing signs and symptoms of urinary retention. A urinary catheter was temporarily inserted to drain his bladder, and he was started on medications to help with bladder emptying. This complication was effectively managed, and the patient's condition improved without further issues.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgical procedure with a generally uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged home with appropriate follow-up appointments with his primary care physician, cardiologist, and surgeon. The patient was advised to continue his medications as prescribed and follow a healthy lifestyle to maintain optimal health and prevent future complications.
