The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on medication for these conditions and is well-controlled. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse.

He came to the hospital for evaluation of chronic knee pain that has been impairing his mobility and quality of life. After further evaluation, it was determined that the patient would benefit from a total knee replacement surgery.

During the preoperative period, the patient underwent routine preoperative assessments, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. He was assessed by a multidisciplinary team, including an anesthesiologist, who determined that the patient was at an acceptable risk for surgery.

The patient underwent total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient did well in the immediate postoperative period. He was monitored closely for any signs of infection, bleeding, or thromboembolic events. Prophylactic antibiotics were initiated perioperatively to reduce the risk of infection.

The patient was instructed to perform range of motion exercises and use assistive devices as needed. Physical therapy was initiated on postoperative day one to optimize his mobility and aid in the rehabilitation process. The patient tolerated the therapy well and was able to ambulate with minimal assistance.

During his hospital stay, the patient had no complications and his vital signs remained stable. Pain control was managed effectively with a combination of non-opioid analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia.

On postoperative day three, the patient was evaluated by the orthopedic surgeon and deemed fit for discharge. He was given instructions regarding wound care, pain management, and follow-up appointments. Home health care services were arranged to continue physical therapy in the outpatient setting.

At the two-week follow-up visit, the patient reported a significant improvement in pain and mobility. The surgical wound was clean and healing well without signs of infection. The patient was able to perform activities of daily living independently and was encouraged to continue with physical therapy.

At three months postoperatively, the patient reported excellent pain relief, and his range of motion had significantly improved. He no longer required the use of assistive devices and was able to return to his regular activities with minimal limitations.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, without any complications. There were no signs of wound infection, thromboembolic events, or other surgical site complications. The patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and his improved quality of life. Overall, the surgery was successful, and the patient had a smooth recovery.
