The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension for the past 10 years, which is well-controlled with medication. He also has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32, indicating obesity.

The patient has a surgical history of an appendectomy performed 20 years ago. He does not have any known drug allergies. Preoperative laboratory investigations revealed normal complete blood count and liver function tests. However, the patient has a mildly elevated serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, which has remained stable for the past year.

The patient is scheduled for an elective cholecystectomy due to recurrent episodes of symptomatic cholelithiasis. The surgery will be performed laparoscopically to minimize postoperative pain and hasten recovery. Prior to surgery, the patient will be counseled on preoperative fasting and bowel preparation, as well as the need to discontinue antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the day of the surgery.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He tolerated the surgery well under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. In the recovery room, his vital signs were stable, and he was able to ambulate without assistance. He experienced mild pain at the surgical site, which was effectively managed with oral analgesics. His urinary output remained within normal limits throughout the postoperative period.

Over the course of the hospital stay, the patient's serum creatinine level remained stable, indicating that his renal function was unaffected by the surgery. He regained bowel function within 24 hours and was able to tolerate a regular diet. On the second postoperative day, the patient was given instructions for wound care and advised to gradually resume his regular physical activities.

The patient did not experience any specific postoperative complications, such as wound infection, bleeding, or deep vein thrombosis. His recovery was deemed satisfactory, and he was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day with appropriate discharge instructions, including pain management and follow-up arrangements.

In summary, this 65-year-old male patient, with a history of well-controlled hypertension and diabetes mellitus, successfully underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. His postoperative course was unremarkable, with no major complications. Despite a mildly elevated serum creatinine level, his renal function remained stable throughout the surgical procedure and recovery period. The patient was discharged home on schedule, with appropriate guidelines for further postoperative care.
