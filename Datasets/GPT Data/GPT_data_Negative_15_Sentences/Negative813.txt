Patient X is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. He has a past surgical history of a cholecystectomy and knee arthroscopy. His current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin for his medical conditions.

Patient X has been experiencing worsening knee pain for the past year, which has significantly impacted his quality of life. After consultation with an orthopedic surgeon, he has decided to undergo a total knee replacement surgery to improve his mobility and reduce his pain.

During the preoperative evaluation, it was noted that Patient X has mild osteoarthritis in his hands and feet but is otherwise healthy. He underwent routine blood work, ECG, and chest X-ray, all of which were within normal limits.

The surgery was performed without any complications, and Patient X was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit before being transferred to the surgical ward. He received adequate pain control with a combination of opioid and non-opioid medications.

Patient X started physical therapy the day after surgery to promote early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He was able to bear weight on his new knee with the assistance of a walker and was gradually weaned off of pain medications.

During his hospital stay, Patient X developed a low-grade fever, which was managed with acetaminophen. He also experienced some mild swelling and bruising around the surgical site, which is a common postoperative occurrence.

After a few days of physical therapy and nursing care, Patient X was discharged home with instructions for wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments. He was advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient to further strengthen his new knee.

At the two-week follow-up appointment, Patient X was progressing well with his recovery. His surgical wound had healed without any signs of infection, and he had regained some range of motion in his knee.

Overall, Patient X had a successful total knee replacement surgery with a smooth postoperative course. He did not experience any major complications such as infection, blood clots, or nerve damage. With continued rehabilitation and close monitoring, he is expected to regain full function of his knee and enjoy an improved quality of life.
