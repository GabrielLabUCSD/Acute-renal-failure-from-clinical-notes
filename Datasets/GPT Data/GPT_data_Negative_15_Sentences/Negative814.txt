The patient is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both well-controlled with medications. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, for which he underwent a successful stent placement five years ago. The patient is a former smoker, having quit 10 years ago.

He presents with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, causing significant pain and functional impairment. Conservative management options have been exhausted, and he is now scheduled for total knee replacement surgery. Preoperative investigations have shown no significant abnormalities, and the patient has been optimized for surgery.

During the surgery, the patient tolerated the procedure well without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he was started on a regimen of pain medications, physical therapy, and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections. The patient's incision site was monitored closely for signs of infection, but he showed no signs of wound complications.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with gradual improvement in pain control and range of motion in the affected knee. He adhered to his physical therapy regimen and made steady progress in his rehabilitation. The patient was discharged home with appropriate instructions for wound care and activity restrictions.

At his follow-up appointment two weeks later, the patient reported significant improvement in his knee pain and function. The surgical site was healing well without any signs of infection or delayed wound healing. His mobility had improved, and he was able to perform daily activities with less difficulty.

Overall, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery with a smooth postoperative course and no complications. He was pleased with the outcome of the procedure and expressed gratitude for the improvement in his quality of life. The patient was advised to continue with his pain medications as needed and to follow up with his orthopedic surgeon for further monitoring of his progress.
