Mr. Smith, a 60-year-old male, presents with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of coronary artery disease requiring a stent placement five years ago. He is a former smoker with a 20-pack-year history.

During the preoperative evaluation, his fasting blood glucose levels were within target range, and his blood pressure was well-controlled. He was cleared for surgery by the anesthesiologist and cardiologist.

Mr. Smith underwent elective surgery for a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. The surgery was uneventful, and he recovered well in the immediate postoperative period. He was started on oral pain medications and gradually transitioned to a regular diet.

Within 24 hours post-surgery, Mr. Smith developed a low-grade fever, which resolved with appropriate antibiotics. His incision site was inspected for signs of infection, and there were no concerning findings. His surgical incision healed without complications, and he was discharged home on postoperative day three.

During his follow-up visit, his blood pressure and blood glucose levels were stable, and he reported minimal pain at the surgical site. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine monitoring of his chronic medical conditions.

Overall, Mr. Smith's postoperative course was unremarkable, with a prompt recovery and resolution of any postoperative issues. He did not experience any complications related to his surgery, and he was satisfied with the outcome of the procedure.
