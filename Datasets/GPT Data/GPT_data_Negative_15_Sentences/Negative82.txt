Patient X is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years, which is well-controlled with medication, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). The patient also has a history of dyslipidemia and has been on a statin medication for the past five years, resulting in well-controlled lipid levels. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is managed with oral antidiabetic medications, including metformin. His HbA1c levels have consistently been within target range. The patient is a former smoker, having quit 15 years ago after smoking for 20 years. He denies any respiratory symptoms and has normal lung function tests.

On further evaluation, the patient is found to have mild left ventricular hypertrophy but maintains preserved systolic function on echocardiography. The patient has occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation that are symptomatic, managed with rate control using a beta-blocker. He does not have any history of coronary artery disease or prior myocardial infarction.

Additionally, the patient has a history of moderate chronic kidney disease, with stable renal function over the past five years. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is consistently around 50 mL/min/1.73mÂ², which is stage 3 chronic kidney disease.

The patient is planned for an elective surgery, and the surgical team has optimized his medical management prior to the procedure. The medications, including antihypertensives, statin, metformin, and beta-blocker, are continued during the perioperative period, with the exception of ACEi, which is held the night before and the day of surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient's course is uneventful. He is managed for adequate pain control and undergoes deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis per protocol. The patient is regularly monitored for vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. His glucose levels are closely monitored, and appropriate insulin adjustments are made. The patient is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent postoperative complications.

At his follow-up visit, the patient reports an uneventful recovery with no complications. His wound healing is satisfactory, and he has been compliant with his postoperative medications. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose levels have remained within target range. He does not have any signs or symptoms of infection or respiratory distress. Overall, the patient's postoperative course is excellent, without any complications.
