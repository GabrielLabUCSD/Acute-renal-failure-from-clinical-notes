The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. He has been struggling with uncontrolled blood pressure despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications such as lisinopril and metoprolol. His diabetes is managed with metformin and glimepiride, but his glycemic control has been suboptimal with recent hemoglobin A1c levels around 8.5%.

The patient is scheduled to undergo knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis that has significantly impacted his quality of life. He has a history of chronic knee pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, which have not responded to conservative treatments such as physical therapy and analgesics. Additionally, he has a family history of heart disease, with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at a young age.

Preoperative testing revealed an elevated fasting blood glucose level of 180 mg/dL and an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, indicating mild kidney dysfunction. The patient has been referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation to optimize his renal function before surgery. His cardiologist has also recommended cardiac clearance to ensure he is fit for the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient had a successful knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative complications. However, he experienced mild postoperative pain and swelling, which were managed with a multimodal analgesic regimen including acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Physical therapy was initiated on postoperative day one to promote early mobilization and recovery.

Despite close monitoring of his renal function postoperatively, the patient did not experience any significant changes in his kidney function, and his creatinine levels remained stable. His blood pressure was well controlled during the postoperative period, with no significant fluctuations. The patient's diabetes management was challenging in the immediate postoperative period due to changes in his oral intake and activity levels, but his blood sugar levels were closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy as needed.

Overall, the patient had a satisfactory postoperative course with no major complications. He made good progress in physical therapy and was able to achieve satisfactory range of motion and functional independence in his knee within the expected timeframe. He was discharged home with a plan for outpatient physical therapy and close follow-up with his primary care physician, nephrologist, and endocrinologist to ensure continued optimization of his medical conditions.
