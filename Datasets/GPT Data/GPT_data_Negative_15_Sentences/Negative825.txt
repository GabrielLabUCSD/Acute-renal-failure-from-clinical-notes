Mr. Smith, a 65-year-old male, is a retired accountant who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He has been on medications for his conditions for the past 10 years and has been compliant with his treatment regimen.

Mr. Smith recently presented to his primary care physician with worsening knee pain due to osteoarthritis in his left knee. After conservative management failed to provide relief, it was decided that he would undergo left total knee replacement surgery to improve his quality of life.

During the preoperative evaluation, Mr. Smith's blood pressure and blood sugar levels were within normal limits, and his cardiac workup showed no evidence of ischemia. He was deemed to be a suitable candidate for surgery.

Postoperatively, Mr. Smith was monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of infection or complications. He was started on a regimen of antibiotics and pain medications to manage his pain and prevent any postoperative infections.

Mr. Smith's rehabilitation process started within 24 hours of surgery, with physical therapy sessions aimed at restoring his knee's range of motion and strength. He was encouraged to mobilize with the help of a walker to prevent any complications associated with prolonged bed rest.

During his hospital stay, Mr. Smith developed a minor wound infection at the surgical site, which was promptly treated with wound care and a prolonged course of antibiotics. The infection resolved without any further complications.

Overall, Mr. Smith's postoperative course was successful, and he was discharged home with a plan for outpatient physical therapy to continue his rehabilitation. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon regularly to ensure proper healing and function of his new knee.
