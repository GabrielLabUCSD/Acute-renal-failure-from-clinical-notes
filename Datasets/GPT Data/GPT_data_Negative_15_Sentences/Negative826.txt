The patient is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. She has been experiencing worsening joint pain in her knees over the past few years, impacting her mobility and quality of life. Conservative management with physical therapy and medications has provided minimal relief, prompting consideration for surgical intervention.

The patient has a history of smoking for 20 years but quit 10 years ago. She has no known drug allergies and takes medications for her chronic conditions regularly. Her family history is notable for cardiovascular disease, but no significant history of surgical complications. 

Upon evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon, the patient was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in both knees and deemed a suitable candidate for bilateral total knee replacement surgery. Preoperative assessments including laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and consultations with other specialists have been completed, indicating the patient is medically optimized for surgery.

The patient is scheduled for surgery in two weeks and has been advised on preoperative instructions, including fasting and medication management. The surgical procedure is expected to improve her joint function, alleviate pain, and enhance her ability to engage in daily activities comfortably. 

Following the surgery, the patient will undergo a period of intense physical therapy to promote joint mobility and strength. Pain management will be closely monitored to ensure adequate comfort during the recovery process. 

In the postoperative period, the patient experienced some swelling and discomfort, which is considered normal following joint replacement surgery. Range of motion exercises and ambulation with assistive devices have been initiated to facilitate recovery. 

The patient has shown good progress in her rehabilitation program, with gradual improvement in joint flexion and extension. She has been educated on proper wound care and signs of infection to monitor at home. 

At the two-week postoperative visit, the surgical wounds are healing well, and the patient reports decreased pain levels compared to preoperatively. Her physical therapist has noted improved strength and gait, with the patient meeting the expected milestones for this stage of recovery. 

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Her blood sugar levels have been stable throughout the hospital stay and recovery period, with appropriate adjustments made to her diabetes medications as needed. 

Overall, the patient's surgical experience and postoperative course have been favorable, with improvements in pain, function, and quality of life noted. She is encouraged to continue with rehabilitation exercises and follow-up appointments to maximize the benefits of the surgery.
