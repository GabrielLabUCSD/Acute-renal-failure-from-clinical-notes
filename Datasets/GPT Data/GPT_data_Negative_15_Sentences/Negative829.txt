The patient has a known allergy to penicillin, with no other drug allergies reported. She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases, with her father having had a heart attack at the age of 60.

The patient underwent a total hysterectomy 5 years ago due to fibroids and has been in generally good health since then. She exercises regularly and follows a balanced diet. Her preoperative evaluation revealed normal kidney function, with a creatinine clearance of 85 mL/min. Her blood pressure was well-controlled with a reading of 120/80 mmHg. Her preoperative laboratory tests, including complete blood count and coagulation profile, were within normal limits.

The patient was counseled about the surgical procedure, its risks, benefits, and alternative options. She was advised on the importance of following preoperative fasting instructions and received instructions for medication management prior to surgery. The patient underwent the surgery under general anesthesia without any complications. The procedure was completed successfully, and she was monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).

In the postoperative period, the patient was managed for pain control with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics as needed. She was encouraged to mobilize early and received deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were closely monitored and remained stable throughout her recovery. She was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any surgical site infections.

The patient experienced some postoperative nausea, which was managed with antiemetic medications, and she was able to tolerate a light diet. Her surgical incision was inspected regularly for signs of infection, and appropriate wound care was provided. The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively, with no signs of acute kidney injury. She was discharged home on the third postoperative day with instructions for wound care, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments.

At her follow-up visit two weeks after surgery, the patient reported feeling well and fully recovered. Her surgical incision had healed well without any signs of infection. Her blood pressure and blood glucose levels were within normal limits. The patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and reported minimal pain at the incision site. Overall, the patient had a successful surgical experience with a smooth postoperative course and no complications, including acute renal failure.
