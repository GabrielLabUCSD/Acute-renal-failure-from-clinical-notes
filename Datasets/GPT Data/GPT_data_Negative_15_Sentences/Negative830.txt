Mr. Smith is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He also has a family history of heart disease. He is scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. 

His medical history includes a myocardial infarction two years ago, for which he underwent coronary angioplasty and stent placement. He is on aspirin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril for secondary prevention. He has no history of chronic kidney disease or renal insufficiency.

In preparation for surgery, Mr. Smith underwent preoperative testing, including an ECG and basic metabolic panel, which were within normal limits. He was advised to stop aspirin five days before the surgery.

During the surgery, Mr. Smith had general anesthesia and did not experience any intraoperative complications. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Postoperatively, he was monitored closely for signs of complications, including infection, bleeding, and respiratory issues. He was started on a clear liquid diet and advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. His pain was managed adequately with oral analgesics.

He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and mobilize early to prevent postoperative complications. Mr. Smith's incisions were clean and dry, with no signs of infection. He did not develop a postoperative ileus or urinary retention.

Overall, Mr. Smith's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day two. He was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician in one week and his surgeon in one month. He was advised to resume his medications as prescribed and continue his healthy lifestyle habits to prevent future health issues.
