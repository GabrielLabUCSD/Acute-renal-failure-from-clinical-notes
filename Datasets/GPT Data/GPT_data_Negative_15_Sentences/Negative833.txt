The patient is a 58-year-old male who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managed on medications for these conditions for the past 10 years. The patient has a history of tobacco use, smoking a pack a day for the past 30 years, but quit smoking 5 years ago. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father passing away from a heart attack at the age of 60.

The patient had a previous surgical history of a cholecystectomy 12 years ago. He had a preoperative evaluation with cardiology and pulmonology due to his comorbidities. His echocardiogram showed mild diastolic dysfunction, and his pulmonary function tests revealed mild obstructive lung disease. The patient had clearance from both specialties for surgery.

The patient underwent the scheduled surgery, which was an elective hernia repair. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia and lasted 2 hours. He tolerated the surgery well with stable vital signs throughout. Postoperatively, the patient was started on pain medications and encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications.

During the postoperative course, the patient developed a postoperative ileus, which was managed conservatively with bowel rest and medication. His pain was controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia pump, and he was closely monitored for signs of infection. The patient's blood glucose levels were monitored closely due to his diabetes, and he required insulin therapy to maintain euglycemia.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any respiratory complications postoperatively. He recovered well and was discharged home on postoperative day 4 with instructions for wound care and follow-up with his primary care physician. The patient was advised to continue following up with his cardiologist and pulmonologist for ongoing management of his chronic conditions.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful, with no major complications aside from the transient postoperative ileus. He was satisfied with the care received during his hospital stay and reported feeling well at the time of discharge. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to ensure continued recovery and monitor for any further issues that may arise.
