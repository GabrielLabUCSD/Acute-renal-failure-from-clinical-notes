The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, with a BMI of 34. He has been on oral antihypertensive medications for the past five years and insulin therapy for diabetes for the past ten years. He also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a CPAP machine at night.

The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 60. He does not smoke and consumes alcohol occasionally. His surgical procedure planned is a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in his left knee, limiting his mobility and causing significant pain.

His preoperative workup revealed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. He underwent a preoperative assessment with the anesthesiologist, who noted no significant findings and cleared him for surgery. The patient was counseled on the importance of optimizing his diabetes control in the perioperative period to prevent complications.

During the surgery, the patient tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, he was started on prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent infection and blood clots. Physical therapy was initiated on the first day after surgery to facilitate early mobilization and rehabilitation.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with adequate pain control achieved through a combination of oral analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia. He was able to bear weight on his operated knee with assistance and gradually transitioned to walking with a walker. His blood pressure and blood sugar levels remained stable throughout the hospital stay.

The patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications, such as wound infection or deep vein thrombosis. However, he developed mild postoperative delirium, which improved with supportive care and medication adjustments. His insensible fluid losses were monitored closely to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient's recovery was smooth, and he was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with a plan for outpatient physical therapy. He was advised to continue his antihypertensive and diabetes medications as prescribed and follow up with his primary care physician for ongoing management.
