The patient, a 55-year-old male, has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years, which is well controlled with medication. He also has a family history of cardiac disease, with his father having had a heart attack at a young age. The patient is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. He has no history of diabetes or lung disease.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood work, ECG, and chest X-ray, all of which were within normal limits. He was advised to discontinue his blood pressure medication the day before surgery.

The surgery he is planning to undergo is a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in his left knee, which has been causing him significant pain and limited mobility for the past few years. He has tried various conservative measures such as physical therapy and corticosteroid injections with little relief.

The patient's surgery went smoothly, with no intraoperative complications reported. He was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for any signs of bleeding, infection, or thrombosis. His pain was managed effectively with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced some nausea and vomiting, which were managed with antiemetic medication. He was encouraged to start ambulation and physical therapy within 24 hours of surgery to prevent blood clots and promote healing.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he showed gradual improvement in his knee range of motion and strength. He was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with a prescription for pain medication and instructions for wound care and physical therapy exercises.

At his follow-up appointment 2 weeks later, the patient was progressing well with physiotherapy and reported a significant reduction in knee pain. However, he mentioned some difficulty sleeping due to discomfort in his knee at night.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of infection, wound complications, or excessive bleeding. He is scheduled for routine follow-up appointments with his orthopedic surgeon to monitor his progress and ensure optimal healing.
