Patient X is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity (BMI of 32). He is scheduled to undergo elective total knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis in his left knee.
His preoperative workup revealed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. However, he has a history of sleep apnea and uses a CPAP machine at night. He has no known drug allergies and is not taking any anticoagulant medications.
In the past, he underwent a cholecystectomy for gallstones and recovered uneventfully. However, he experienced a myocardial infarction five years ago and had a stent placed in one of his coronary arteries. He is on aspirin and statin therapy for secondary prevention.
Patient X is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He reports occasional alcohol consumption but denies illicit drug use. He lives alone but has family support during his recovery period.
During the surgery, he was placed under general anesthesia, and the procedure was performed without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he received adequate pain management and was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection.
His recovery in the hospital was uneventful, and he was able to bear weight on his new knee with assistance from physical therapy. He was discharged home on postoperative day three with a plan for outpatient physical therapy and close follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon.
At his two-week follow-up appointment, he was doing well and reported improvement in his mobility and pain levels. He was encouraged to continue with physical therapy and advised on the importance of adhering to his medication regimen.
Despite his good progress, Patient X developed a wound infection at the surgical site three weeks after surgery, which was successfully treated with a course of oral antibiotics. He was closely monitored for any signs of infection recurrence and was able to resume his normal activities after completing the antibiotics.
Overall, Patient X had a successful total knee replacement surgery with a minor complication of a wound infection that was promptly addressed. He continues to improve with ongoing rehabilitation and is optimistic about his future mobility and quality of life.
