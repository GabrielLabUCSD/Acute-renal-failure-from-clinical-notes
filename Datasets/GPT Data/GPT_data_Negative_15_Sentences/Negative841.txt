The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He has a history of a myocardial infarction five years ago for which he underwent coronary artery stenting. The patient also has a family history of heart disease.

He presents now for elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. He has been experiencing significant knee pain, stiffness, and difficulty with mobility. His medical team has optimized his blood sugar control and blood pressure in preparation for surgery. 

The patient takes daily medications including metformin for his diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and atorvastatin for his cholesterol. He has no known drug allergies. Preoperative labs including a complete blood count and metabolic panel are within normal limits.

During the surgery, the patient was monitored closely by the anesthesia team and the orthopedic surgeon. The procedure went smoothly without any reported complications. The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring and pain control.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient received physical therapy to aid in his recovery and to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He was started on a regimen of pain medications including acetaminophen and opioid analgesics as needed.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was able to start mobilizing with the help of a physical therapist within 24 hours of the surgery. His surgical wound was clean and without signs of infection. His vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay.

He was discharged home after three days in the hospital with a follow-up appointment scheduled with his orthopedic surgeon in two weeks. The patient was instructed on wound care, medication management, and signs of infection to watch for at home.

At his follow-up appointment, the patient reported good pain control and improvement in his knee mobility. He continued physical therapy as an outpatient to further strengthen his knee and improve his range of motion. The patient did not experience any postoperative complications such as wound infections or significant bleeding.
