The patient is a 52-year-old male who has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years. He is also a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history. The patient has been on antihypertensive and oral hypoglycemic medications to manage his conditions.

He has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a history of myocardial infarction at the age of 60. The patient has undergone previous surgeries for an appendectomy and hernia repair without any complications.

The patient recently presented with symptoms of osteoarthritis in his right knee, which have been progressively worsening over the past year, limiting his mobility and causing significant pain. After consultation with an orthopedic surgeon, he has decided to undergo a total knee replacement surgery to improve his quality of life.

The patient has undergone preoperative assessments, including laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray, which all showed within normal limits. He has been counselled on the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for infection, blood clots, and adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient underwent the total knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he was closely monitored for signs of infection, thrombosis, and postoperative pain management. Physical therapy was initiated to help with his rehabilitation and recovery.

During the postoperative course, the patient developed a mild surgical site infection, which was promptly treated with antibiotics. He also experienced some postoperative pain and swelling, which were managed with analgesics and ice packs.

The patient made steady progress with his physical therapy and was eventually able to bear weight on his operated leg. He was discharged home with instructions for wound care, medication management, and follow-up with his primary care physician.

Upon follow-up visits, the patient's surgical site infection had resolved, and he was progressing well with his rehabilitation. He reported a significant improvement in his knee pain and mobility compared to before the surgery.

Overall, the patient's total knee replacement surgery was successful in improving his quality of life and functional status. Despite the minor complication of a surgical site infection, he has recovered well and is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery.

The patient has been advised to continue with physical therapy and adhere to a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to maintain the longevity of his knee replacement. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor his progress and address any concerns that may arise.
