The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. She has been on antihypertensive medication for 10 years and insulin for 5 years. The patient also has a history of mild osteoarthritis in her knees and has undergone physical therapy in the past to manage the pain.

She is scheduled to undergo a total knee replacement surgery due to worsening knee pain and decreased mobility. The patient has had multiple consultations with her orthopedic surgeon and has completed all preoperative testing, including blood work and imaging studies. She has been advised to continue taking her medications leading up to the surgery, with the exception of one anticoagulant that will be temporarily stopped.

During the surgery, the patient's vitals remained stable, and the procedure was completed without any complications. Postoperatively, she received appropriate pain management and was encouraged to begin physical therapy early to promote mobility and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient followed the recommended postoperative care instructions closely, including wound care and medication management. Regular follow-up appointments with her surgeon were scheduled to monitor the healing process and assess her progress with physical therapy. The patient experienced some expected postoperative pain and swelling but reported gradual improvement in her knee function.

At the one-month follow-up appointment, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in her mobility and reported decreased pain compared to before the surgery. She was able to perform daily activities with more ease and was satisfied with the outcome of the procedure. The patient did not experience any major complications during her recovery period and was able to resume her normal activities with caution and supervision.
