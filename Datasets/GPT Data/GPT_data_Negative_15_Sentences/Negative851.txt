The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, who is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a hip replacement. She has had well-controlled hypertension for the past five years with medications. Her diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications.

The patient has a history of mild osteoarthritis in both knees and has been experiencing progressive pain and limited mobility in her right hip for the past year. She has tried conservative management with physical therapy and pain medications but has not experienced significant relief.

Preoperative evaluation revealed no significant abnormalities in her blood work, ECG, or chest X-ray. The patient has been advised to discontinue her antihypertensive medications the morning of surgery and to maintain fasting status as per the surgical team's instructions.

Following surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful initially, with adequate pain control and early mobilization with physical therapy. She was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and blood thinners to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

The patient developed mild wound drainage at the surgical site, which was managed with wound care and appropriate dressings. She also experienced transient episodes of dizziness likely due to changes in her blood pressure in the immediate postoperative period.

However, the patient did not experience any significant complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. She was discharged home after a week in the hospital with instructions for follow-up with her primary care provider and physical therapist for ongoing rehabilitation.
