Our patient is a 55-year-old male named Mr. Smith who is planning to undergo hernia repair surgery. He has a significant past medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, all well-controlled with medications. Mr. Smith had a previous surgery for appendicitis 10 years ago, without any complications. He also has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 60.

During the preoperative assessment, it was noted that Mr. Smith has a BMI of 30, which classifies him as obese. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. His preoperative laboratory tests revealed normal kidney function with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemic changes.

Following the hernia repair surgery, Mr. Smith had a smooth postoperative course without any immediate complications. He was started on pain medications to manage postoperative discomfort and encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He was closely monitored for signs of infection at the surgical site and received appropriate wound care according to the surgical team's guidelines.

On the third postoperative day, Mr. Smith developed a mild postoperative fever, which was managed with acetaminophen. His vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of systemic infection. The surgical wound appeared clean and dry without any signs of dehiscence or infection. Mr. Smith was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with instructions for wound care and a follow-up appointment in one week.

During the follow-up visit, Mr. Smith was doing well with no complaints of pain or other issues related to the surgery. His surgical wound had healed well with no signs of infection or complications. Overall, Mr. Smith's postoperative course was uneventful, and he recovered from the surgery without any major complications. He was advised to continue his regular medications and follow-up with his primary care physician for ongoing management of his chronic conditions.
