Patient X is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. She has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years and takes oral hypoglycemic agents for diabetes control. She has a BMI of 35 and a history of smoking, but she quit 5 years ago.

The patient has been experiencing worsening knee pain over the past year, limiting her mobility and affecting her quality of life. After consulting with an orthopedic surgeon, it was determined that she would benefit from total knee replacement surgery to address the degenerative joint disease in her left knee.

Her preoperative workup revealed well-controlled hypertension and diabetes, with no signs of end-organ damage. Her baseline renal function is within normal limits. She underwent the surgery without any immediate complications and was started on a postoperative pain management regimen.

During her postoperative course, the patient experienced some expected pain and swelling, which were managed with analgesics and physical therapy. She also received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent blood clots. Her diabetes and blood pressure were closely monitored and remained stable throughout the hospital stay.

The patient was able to start bearing weight on her operated leg with the help of a physical therapist and gradually regained mobility. She was discharged home with instructions for wound care, physical therapy exercises, and follow-up appointments with her surgeon. There were no signs of infection or wound healing complications noted at the time of discharge.

In the following weeks, Patient X continued to make progress with her rehabilitation and reported improved functionality and reduced pain in her knee. She adhered to her medication regimen and attended all scheduled follow-up visits. Her diabetes and blood pressure remained well controlled.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery and an uncomplicated postoperative course. She achieved her goal of improved mobility and quality of life following the knee replacement procedure. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and was grateful for the comprehensive care she received from her healthcare team.
