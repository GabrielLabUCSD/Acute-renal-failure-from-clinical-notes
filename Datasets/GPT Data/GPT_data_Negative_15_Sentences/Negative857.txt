Patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, who is scheduled for elective knee replacement surgery. She has a past surgical history of cholecystectomy and has no known drug allergies. Her current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.

The patient's preoperative labs show well-controlled blood glucose levels with an HbA1c of 6.5%. Her blood pressure is within target range on her current medication regimen. She has a BMI of 32 and no history of smoking or alcohol use.

During the surgery, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection. The procedure went smoothly without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for pain management and signs of infection.

The patient followed the prescribed physical therapy regimen to aid in rehabilitation post-surgery. She was able to bear weight on the operative knee within 24 hours and showed good progress in her mobility. There were no signs of surgical site infection or deep vein thrombosis during her hospital stay.

At the follow-up appointment two weeks after surgery, the patient reported significant improvement in knee pain and function. She was advised to continue with physical therapy and to monitor her blood glucose levels closely due to the surgical stress response.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery with no major complications. She was satisfied with the outcome and expressed gratitude for the care she received from the healthcare team. The patient was counseled on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to optimize her recovery and prevent future complications related to her chronic conditions.
