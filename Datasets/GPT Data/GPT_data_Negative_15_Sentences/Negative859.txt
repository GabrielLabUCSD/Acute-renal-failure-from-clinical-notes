The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and mild osteoarthritis in the knees, who is scheduled for total knee replacement surgery due to severe joint pain and limited mobility. He is otherwise healthy and has no history of smoking or alcohol abuse.
His preoperative evaluation revealed well-controlled blood pressure with medication, and his lab work showed normal renal function, liver enzymes, and electrolyte levels. The patient reported no known drug allergies.
During the surgery, the patient received spinal anesthesia and experienced a smooth procedure without any intraoperative complications. The surgeon successfully replaced the knee joint with a prosthetic implant, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, wound healing, and signs of infection. Physical therapy was initiated to promote early mobilization and improve joint function.
Over the next few days, the patient's pain gradually improved with the help of pain medications, and he was able to bear weight on the operated knee with assistance. He received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections and deep venous thrombosis.
The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home with a plan for outpatient physical therapy and follow-up appointments with his surgeon. He was advised to continue his blood pressure medications and to monitor for any signs of infection or blood clots.
At the follow-up visit one month after surgery, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in knee mobility and pain relief. He reported minimal discomfort with walking and stairs, and his incision site appeared to be healing well without signs of infection.
Overall, the patient's surgical outcome was successful, and he achieved the desired pain relief and improved function in the replaced knee. Despite the expected postoperative discomfort and challenges with physical therapy, the patient remained motivated and compliant with the recommended rehabilitation program.
There were no complications noted during the patient's recovery period, and he did not experience any issues with wound healing, pain management, or infections. The patient was satisfied with the surgical outcome and expressed gratitude for the care provided by the healthcare team.
