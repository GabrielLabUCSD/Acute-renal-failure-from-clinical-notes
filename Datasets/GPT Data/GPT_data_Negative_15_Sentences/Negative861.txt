The patient is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, with a body mass index of 32. She presents with chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease and has been recommended by her orthopedic surgeon to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to relieve her symptoms.

The patient has a history of smoking for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. She has no known drug allergies and is currently taking medications for her hypertension and diabetes. She has had previous surgeries including a cholecystectomy and a knee arthroscopy without any complications.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were within normal limits, and her renal function was stable. She underwent the lumbar fusion surgery without any intraoperative complications and was discharged home on postoperative day 2 with adequate pain control and instructions for wound care and activity restrictions.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild incisional pain, which was managed with oral analgesics. She was advised to follow up with her primary care physician and physical therapist for postoperative rehabilitation. At her 2-week follow-up appointment, the surgical wound was healing well, and she was gradually able to increase her activity level.

The patient did not experience any postoperative complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia. She adhered to the prescribed medication regimen and physical therapy exercises, which contributed to her successful recovery. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and reported a significant improvement in her lower back pain and functional status.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was uneventful, and she was able to resume her daily activities and return to work within 6 weeks postoperatively. She was advised to continue monitoring her blood pressure and blood glucose levels regularly and to maintain a healthy lifestyle to optimize her long-term outcomes.
