The patient is a 58-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. She has been on medications for the management of her conditions for the past 10 years. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with her father having a history of heart attacks.

The patient has been experiencing chronic knee pain for the past 5 years due to osteoarthritis, which has significantly impacted her quality of life and ability to perform daily activities. Despite conservative management including physical therapy and steroid injections, her symptoms have persisted, and she has opted for surgery to alleviate her pain and improve mobility.

She underwent a total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure went smoothly, with no intraoperative complications reported. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, wound healing, and physical therapy to aid in her recovery process.

The patient did experience some expected postoperative pain and swelling, which were managed with a combination of medications including opioids and anti-inflammatories. Physical therapy was initiated early to promote range of motion and strength in the knee joint.

She developed a mild surgical site infection, which was promptly treated with antibiotics and wound care. The infection resolved without further complications, and the patient was able to resume her rehabilitation program without any significant setbacks.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was marked by steady progress and improvement in her knee function. She was discharged home with a comprehensive plan for continued physical therapy and close follow-up with her orthopedic surgeon.

Despite the minor complication of a surgical site infection, the patient's recovery was successful, and she was able to regain function and mobility in her knee. She expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and reported a significant reduction in pain and improvement in her quality of life.
