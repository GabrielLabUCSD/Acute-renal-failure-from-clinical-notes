Mrs. Smith, a 65-year-old female, has a significant medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She is also a former smoker with a 20-year history of smoking a pack a day. She has a BMI of 32 and has been struggling with obesity for several years.

Mrs. Smith has been experiencing worsening knee pain due to osteoarthritis, which has significantly impacted her quality of life and ability to participate in daily activities. After exhausting conservative management options, she has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery to improve her mobility and reduce pain.

Prior to surgery, Mrs. Smith underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation which included cardiac clearance due to her history of hypertension. Her medications were adjusted to optimize her blood pressure control and blood sugar levels before the procedure. She was also counseled on smoking cessation and encouraged to continue a healthy diet and exercise regimen leading up to the surgery.

The surgery was performed without any complications, and Mrs. Smith's postoperative course was generally uneventful. She was closely monitored for signs of infection, blood clots, and wound healing. Physical therapy was initiated early to help her regain strength and range of motion in her new knee joint.

Mrs. Smith was discharged home with a plan for outpatient physical therapy and close follow-up with her orthopedic surgeon. She was educated on proper wound care, pain management strategies, and signs of potential complications to watch for postoperatively.

During her recovery at home, Mrs. Smith experienced some mild swelling and discomfort around the surgical site, which improved with rest and elevation. She diligently followed her physical therapy regimen and gradually regained her mobility and independence.

Overall, Mrs. Smith's recovery was successful, and she was able to return to her normal activities with significantly reduced knee pain. She did not experience any major complications postoperatively, and her surgical wound healed well without any signs of infection.

Mrs. Smith's positive outcome underscores the importance of comprehensive preoperative preparation and postoperative care in managing patients with complex medical histories undergoing surgery. Her commitment to rehabilitation and lifestyle modifications also played a crucial role in her successful recovery and improved quality of life.
