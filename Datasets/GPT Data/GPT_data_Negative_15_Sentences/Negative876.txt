The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, and is scheduled for elective knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis.

He has a history of coronary artery disease and had a previous myocardial infarction five years ago, for which he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

The patient has been on a daily regimen of aspirin, metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metoprolol for his medical conditions.

He has had a recent echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction of 55% without any significant valvular abnormalities.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has a history of tolerating anesthesia well in the past.

The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia, and all necessary preoperative labs and imaging studies have been completed and found to be within normal limits.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for pain control, infection prevention, and early mobilization to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

Physical therapy will be initiated on the first postoperative day to aid in the patient's recovery and rehabilitation.

The patient will be started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections during the hospital stay.

Routine postoperative labs, such as complete blood count and metabolic panel, will be monitored to ensure proper healing and recovery.

The patient will also receive deep breathing exercises and incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis and improve lung function.

Complications such as wound dehiscence, respiratory issues, or postoperative delirium will be closely monitored and promptly addressed if they arise.

Despite optimal postoperative care, the patient developed a surgical site infection that required drainage and IV antibiotics.

The surgical site infection resolved with appropriate treatment, and the patient was discharged home with a course of oral antibiotics and home health nursing for wound care.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was complicated by a surgical site infection but otherwise progressed well with appropriate management and follow-up care.
