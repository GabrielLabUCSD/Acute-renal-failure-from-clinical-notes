Patient is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history. The patient has a body mass index of 32, indicating obesity. He presents with symptoms of worsening angina and shortness of breath on exertion, prompting the need for surgical intervention. 

The patient has undergone previous cardiac catheterization showing significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, for which he is scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. His preoperative cardiac function is assessed to have an ejection fraction of 40%, indicating reduced cardiac output. The patient is also on multiple medications including aspirin, atorvastatin, metformin, lisinopril, and metoprolol.

Prior to surgery, the patient undergoes preoperative optimization of his medical conditions including intensification of his antihypertensive and diabetic medications. He is educated on smoking cessation and advised on postoperative care. The surgical procedure goes smoothly, with the patient kept under close monitoring in the post-anesthesia care unit for hemodynamic stability and pain management.

In the postoperative course, the patient is started on appropriate post-surgical medications to prevent infection and promote wound healing. He is closely monitored for signs of infection, bleeding, and cardiac complications. The patient undergoes cardiac rehabilitation to improve his cardiac function and physical endurance. However, he experiences postoperative atrial fibrillation, which is managed with appropriate medications and monitoring.

The patient's recovery is overall favorable, with gradual improvement in his symptoms of angina and shortness of breath. He is discharged home with instructions for wound care, medications, and follow-up appointments with the cardiologist. The patient is advised to continue lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise to improve his overall health. In the subsequent follow-up visits, the patient shows good progress in his cardiac function and is pleased with the outcome of the surgery.
