The patient, a 55-year-old male, presents with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He has been taking medications for these conditions for the past five years, with good compliance and control of his blood pressure and blood sugar levels.

The patient underwent a coronary angiogram three years ago, which revealed significant blockages in his coronary arteries. He subsequently had a stent placement and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then.

He also reports a history of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea for which he uses a CPAP machine at night. He has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago.

The patient's surgical procedure is planned for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in his left knee. He has been experiencing significant pain and limited mobility for the past two years despite conservative management.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's labs revealed well-controlled blood sugar levels and stable kidney function. His cardiologist cleared him for surgery with recommendations for perioperative monitoring of his cardiac status.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced some expected pain and swelling in the surgical site, which were managed with pain medication and physical therapy. He was able to start ambulating with assistance on the second day after surgery.

There were no signs of infection or wound complications noted during the postoperative period. The patient's blood sugar levels were closely monitored in the perioperative period and remained within target range.

He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further therapy and monitoring before transitioning home. The patient was encouraged to continue with his diabetes and blood pressure medications as prescribed.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery and uneventful postoperative course without any major complications. He will follow up with his primary care provider and orthopedic surgeon for continued care and monitoring of his knee replacement.
