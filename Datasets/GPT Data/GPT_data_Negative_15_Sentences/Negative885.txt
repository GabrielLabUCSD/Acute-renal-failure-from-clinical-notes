The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, who is scheduled to undergo a total knee replacement surgery.

She has a past surgical history significant for a cholecystectomy 10 years ago and a hysterectomy 5 years ago.

Her current medications include metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and ibuprofen for knee pain.

She has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with her father having a history of myocardial infarction in his 50s.

Her preoperative workup revealed well-controlled blood pressure and blood sugar levels, with no signs of infection or clotting abnormalities.

The patient underwent the surgery without any intraoperative complications and received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

Postoperatively, she was started on physical therapy to promote early mobilization and prevent joint stiffness.

She experienced mild postoperative pain, which was managed with a combination of acetaminophen and opioids as needed.

The patient was closely monitored for signs of deep vein thrombosis and received prophylaxis with compression stockings and blood thinners.

She developed a mild wound infection a week after surgery, which was treated with antibiotics and wound care, resulting in complete resolution.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient's blood sugar levels were closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia.

She was discharged home on the fourth postoperative day with instructions for wound care and physical therapy.

At her follow-up appointment 2 weeks post-surgery, the patient was progressing well with physical therapy and had good range of motion in her knee.

Overall, aside from the mild wound infection, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she is expected to make a full recovery with continued rehabilitation.
