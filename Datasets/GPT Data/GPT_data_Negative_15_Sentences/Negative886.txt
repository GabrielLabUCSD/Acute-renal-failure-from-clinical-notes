The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He has been on medication for his conditions for the past 10 years and has been compliant with his treatment plan. He had a previous heart attack three years ago, which was managed with stenting.

The patient had a recent episode of chest pain, prompting further evaluation with a cardiac catheterization that revealed significant blockages in his coronary arteries. As a result, his cardiologist recommended he undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) to improve blood flow to his heart.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood work, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray. His medications were carefully reviewed, and adjustments were made to ensure optimal perioperative management.

During the surgery, the patient had no significant intraoperative complications. The CABG procedure was successful, with multiple grafts placed to bypass the blocked coronary arteries, resulting in improved blood flow to the heart muscle. The patient was closely monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit postoperatively.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient required mechanical ventilation to support his breathing and was started on intravenous medications to maintain his blood pressure and heart function. He was gradually weaned off the ventilator and transferred to a regular hospital room for further recovery. Physical therapy was initiated to help him regain strength and mobility.

The patient experienced some postoperative pain, which was managed with a combination of medications including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He was closely monitored for signs of infection, bleeding, or other complications, and his wound healing was assessed regularly.

Fortunately, the patient did not develop any major complications during his hospital stay. His blood sugar levels were carefully monitored to prevent hyperglycemia, and his blood pressure was controlled within target ranges. His cardiac function was stable, with no signs of ongoing ischemia or arrhythmias.

After a week in the hospital, the patient was discharged home with a comprehensive care plan that included instructions for medication management, wound care, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments with his cardiologist. He was advised to participate in cardiac rehabilitation to further optimize his recovery and long-term outcomes.

Overall, the patient's surgery was a success, and he is expected to experience significant improvement in his cardiac function and overall quality of life. With continued adherence to his treatment plan and lifestyle modifications, he has a good prognosis for long-term cardiovascular health.
