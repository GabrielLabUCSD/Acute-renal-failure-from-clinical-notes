The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery five years ago and has been managed with medications ever since. The patient also has a history of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea, for which he uses a CPAP machine at night.

He is scheduled to undergo an elective knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis in his right knee, which has been causing him significant pain and mobility issues. The patient has been on a stable dose of medications for his chronic conditions and has been deemed fit for surgery after a thorough preoperative evaluation.

Following the knee replacement surgery, the patient had a smooth postoperative course initially, with adequate pain control and physical therapy to aid in his recovery. However, on postoperative day three, he developed a surgical site infection which required antibiotic therapy and wound care management. The infection delayed his rehabilitation process and necessitated a longer hospital stay.

Despite the complication, the patient eventually responded well to the antibiotic treatment and his wound started to heal. He was able to resume physical therapy and regain strength in his knee. The patient's diabetes was closely monitored during his hospital stay to ensure optimal blood sugar control, which was managed with insulin therapy as needed.

The patient was discharged home with a course of oral antibiotics to complete the treatment for the surgical site infection. He was advised to continue with physical therapy and follow up with his healthcare provider for wound checks and medication management. Overall, the patient's recovery was successful despite the setback of the surgical site infection, and he was pleased with the outcome of the knee replacement surgery.
