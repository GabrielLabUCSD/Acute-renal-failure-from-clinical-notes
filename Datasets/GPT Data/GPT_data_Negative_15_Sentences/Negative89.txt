Patient X is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He presents to the hospital with severe knee pain and functional impairment due to advanced osteoarthritis of the left knee. After thorough evaluation and discussion with the orthopedic surgeon, he has opted for total knee replacement surgery. His preoperative labs reveal controlled blood glucose levels and stable renal function, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. 

In the past, Patient X has undergone cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones, and he has a history of myocardial infarction requiring coronary artery bypass graft surgery five years ago. His cardiovascular status is currently stable, with good exercise tolerance and no angina symptoms. He is on a medical regimen of metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. His blood pressure is well-controlled at 128/74 mmHg.

As part of the preoperative assessment, Patient X undergoes a complete medical workup. His electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with no acute changes. His chest X-ray is unremarkable. His pulmonary function tests indicate mild restrictive lung disease likely related to obesity. The echocardiogram reveals a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with no significant valvular abnormalities. His preoperative antibiotics include cefazolin as per the surgical protocol.

The total knee replacement surgery is performed successfully without any intraoperative complications. Patient X is closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit and subsequently transferred to the surgical ward. During the hospital stay, he is able to ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is provided through subcutaneous administration of low molecular weight heparin. 

Patient X's postoperative course is uneventful, and he remains afebrile throughout his recovery. His pain is well-managed with oral analgesics, primarily acetaminophen and opioid medications. Wound healing progresses satisfactorily, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. His vital signs remain stable, and he maintains good oral intake. Laboratory evaluations, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, are within normal limits during his hospitalization. 

Patient X is discharged home on the fourth postoperative day, following the attainment of functional independence and a stable medical condition. He is provided with appropriate discharge instructions, including wound care, medication management, rehabilitation exercises, and signs of potential complications. There were no specific postoperative complications encountered during the hospital stay, and Patient X is advised to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks with his orthopedic surgeon.
