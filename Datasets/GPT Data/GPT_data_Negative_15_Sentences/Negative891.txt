The patient is a 58-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. She has been on medications for these conditions for the past 10 years and has well-controlled blood pressure and blood sugar levels.

She was also diagnosed with osteoarthritis in her left knee, which has been causing her significant pain and limited mobility over the past two years. Conservative treatments, including physical therapy and corticosteroid injections, have provided little relief.

After consulting with her orthopedic surgeon, the decision was made to proceed with a total knee replacement surgery to improve her quality of life and ability to perform daily activities without pain.

The patient underwent preoperative evaluations, including lab work, electrocardiogram, and imaging studies, all of which were within normal limits aside from a slightly elevated fasting blood glucose level.

Surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications, and the patient was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit before being transferred to the surgical floor.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced moderate pain, which was managed with a combination of opioids and non-opioid pain medications. Physical therapy was initiated the day after surgery to help with mobility and strengthening exercises.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with gradual improvement in her pain and range of motion. She was able to bear weight on her operated knee with the assistance of a walker and had minimal swelling or signs of infection at the surgical site.

The patient was discharged home with a prescription for physical therapy and instructions for wound care and pain management. She was advised to follow up with her surgeon in two weeks for a wound check and suture removal.

At the two-week follow-up visit, the patient was found to be healing well, with no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. Her range of motion was improving, and she reported decreased pain compared to before surgery.

Overall, the patient's recovery was smooth, and she was satisfied with the results of the surgery. She was able to gradually increase her activity level and return to most of her daily activities within a few weeks.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any complications during her postoperative course, such as deep vein thrombosis, surgical site infection, or persistent pain. She was compliant with her medications and rehabilitation plan, which contributed to her successful recovery from surgery.
