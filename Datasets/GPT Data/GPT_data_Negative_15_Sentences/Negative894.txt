The patient is a 55-year-old male, who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He has been on antihypertensive medications and insulin for the past 10 years. He had a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago, which was managed with angioplasty and stent placement.

The patient has a 20 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 5 years ago. He reports occasional alcohol consumption but denies any recreational drug use. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a history of myocardial infarction.

The patient has been experiencing progressive joint pain and mobility issues due to severe osteoarthritis in his knees. Conservative management with physical therapy and NSAIDs have been ineffective, prompting the decision to undergo total knee replacement surgery. He has been evaluated by the orthopedic surgeon and deemed a suitable candidate for the procedure.

Following the surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful initially, with adequate pain control and early mobilization. However, on the third postoperative day, he developed a wound infection at the surgical site, characterized by erythema, warmth, and purulent drainage. The infection was promptly treated with antibiotics, wound care, and close monitoring.

The patient's recovery was slightly delayed due to the wound infection but eventually improved with appropriate management. Physical therapy was resumed once the infection resolved, and he made steady progress with rehabilitation. His blood sugar levels were closely monitored during the hospital stay and managed with insulin to prevent any glycemic fluctuations.

Overall, despite the setback of the wound infection, the patient's surgical outcome was successful, with significant improvement in knee pain and function. He was discharged home with instructions for wound care, physical therapy, and a follow-up appointment with his orthopedic surgeon. The patient was advised to continue his medications for hypertension and diabetes and to maintain a healthy lifestyle to optimize his long-term outcomes.
