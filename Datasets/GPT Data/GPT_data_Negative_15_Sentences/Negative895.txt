The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. She has a history of coronary artery disease but has not had any recent cardiac events. She is a nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol.

Her current medications include metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. She has no known drug allergies. Her baseline kidney function is normal, with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate of 90 mL/min.

The patient is scheduled to undergo knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis that has limited her mobility and quality of life. Preoperative evaluation reveals well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. She has been advised to discontinue her metformin prior to surgery.

The surgery is performed without complications, and the patient is monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit. She is started on aggressive pain management and physical therapy to aid in her recovery. She is also placed on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent blood clots.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experiences some mild discomfort and swelling around the surgical site, which is managed with ice packs and elevation of the leg. Her blood glucose levels remain stable, and her blood pressure is well-controlled.

Over the next few days, the patient progresses well with physical therapy and is able to bear weight on her new knee. She is discharged home with a plan for outpatient physical therapy and close follow-up with her orthopedic surgeon.

During her recovery at home, the patient develops a superficial wound infection at the incision site, which is treated with antibiotics. The infection resolves without further complications, and the patient continues to make good progress in her rehabilitation.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course is uncomplicated aside from the superficial wound infection. Her kidney function remains stable, with no evidence of acute renal failure. She is satisfied with the outcome of her surgery and is able to regain mobility and independence in her daily activities.
