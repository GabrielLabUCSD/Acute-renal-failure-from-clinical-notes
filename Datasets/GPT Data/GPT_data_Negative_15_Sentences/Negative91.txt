Patient is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, for which the patient is on regular antihypertensive medication. The patient has a history of smoking, with a 20-pack-year smoking history, but quit smoking five years ago. He has a sedentary lifestyle and does not participate in regular exercise. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having suffered from a myocardial infarction in his 50s.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had undergone an appendectomy 10 years ago without any complications. The patient does not have a known drug allergy and denies any previous adverse reactions to anesthesia. Laboratory investigations reveal a complete blood count within normal limits, with a hemoglobin level of 14 g/dL. The liver and kidney function tests are also within normal limits.

Preoperative imaging studies, including an ultrasound and a computed tomography (CT) scan, confirm the presence of an inguinal hernia and ruling out any other pathology. The patient has been advised to stop taking any anticoagulant medications and to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for two weeks prior to surgery.

The patient is scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the surgical team successfully repairs the hernia without any complications. The patient is monitored closely postoperatively for any signs of infection, bleeding, or complications related to anesthesia. Postoperative pain is managed with regular doses of analgesics. The patient is able to tolerate oral intake and is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent postoperative complications.

During the postoperative course, the patient progresses well with no immediate complications such as wound infection, hematoma, or seroma formation. He is able to mobilize independently, and the surgical wound shows signs of normal healing without any signs of dehiscence or erythema. The patient is discharged on the third postoperative day with appropriate wound care instructions and a prescription for pain management.

During follow-up visits, the patient's wound continues to heal well, and he reports minimal pain. The patient is encouraged to gradually increase physical activity, including regular exercise, to improve overall cardiovascular health. At the final follow-up visit, the patient remains symptom-free and without any complications related to the surgery.
