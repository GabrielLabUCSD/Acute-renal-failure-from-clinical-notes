The patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity is planning to have surgery. The patient's blood pressure has been intermittently controlled with a combination of medication, however, their diabetes has been poorly controlled with diet and lifestyle modifications alone. They are non-compliant with taking their medication regularly and do not consistently monitor their blood glucose levels. The patient also has a history of smoking, consuming 1 pack per day for the past 10 years, but has expressed a willingness to quit.

During the preoperative evaluation, it was discovered that the patient has mild chronic kidney disease, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50 mL/min/1.73mÂ². The cause of the kidney disease is likely multifactorial, given the patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. However, there is no evidence of acute renal failure.

The patient's surgical procedure has been planned to be performed under general anesthesia. The patient has been advised to stop smoking at least one month prior to the surgery to decrease the risk of postoperative complications. They have been referred to a smoking cessation program for support.

Postoperatively, the patient tolerated the surgery well. They were monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability. Pain control was managed using a combination of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was instructed to perform deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent complications of immobility.

Over the course of their hospital stay, the patient's blood pressure remained stable, consistently below 140/90 mmHg. However, their blood glucose levels remained elevated, requiring supplemental insulin therapy to achieve adequate glycemic control. The patient was educated on the importance of diet and medication adherence in controlling their diabetes.

The patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia. Their wound healing progressed without any signs of dehiscence or infection. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4 with instructions to continue their antihypertensive medication and insulin therapy. They were also referred to a diabetes educator for further management and education.

During the postoperative follow-up visits, the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were monitored. The patient's blood pressure remained consistently controlled with medication, and their glycemic control improved with insulin therapy and dietary modifications. However, they still struggled with occasional non-compliance in taking their medication regularly.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, with no evidence of acute renal failure. However, the patient's long-term prognosis remains dependent on their ability to better manage their diabetes and adhere to their prescribed medication regimen. Continual support and education are vital in ensuring optimal outcomes for this patient.
