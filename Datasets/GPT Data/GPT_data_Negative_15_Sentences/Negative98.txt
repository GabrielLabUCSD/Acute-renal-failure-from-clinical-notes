The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented to the hospital with severe lower back pain and numbness in the left leg. He has a history of chronic low back pain for the past 10 years, which has been managed with physical therapy and pain medications.

The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently taking lisinopril for hypertension, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and metformin for diabetes control.

Upon physical examination, the patient had decreased sensation and strength in the left leg, and the straight leg raise test was positive. An MRI of the lumbar spine revealed a large disc herniation at the L4-L5 level, causing compression of the left nerve root.

After discussion of the different treatment options, the patient decided to undergo surgical intervention for his disc herniation. The surgeon suggested a discectomy procedure to remove the herniated disc material and relieve the nerve compression.

The patient underwent surgery without any complications. The surgical procedure was successful, and the patient's symptoms improved immediately after the surgery. He required minimal pain medication postoperatively and was able to ambulate without any difficulty.

In the postoperative period, the patient was kept on bed rest for 24 hours and then allowed to ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy. He was provided with instructions for proper back care and exercises to strengthen his back muscles.

The patient remained in the hospital for three days postoperatively and was discharged in stable condition. He was advised to continue taking his regular medications and instructed to follow up with his primary care physician for ongoing management of his hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

During the follow-up visits, the patient reported a gradual improvement in his back pain and leg numbness. He continued to participate in physical therapy as recommended and was able to resume his daily activities without any limitations.

Interestingly, the patient did not experience any complications during his postoperative course. He did not develop any surgical site infections, deep vein thrombosis, or wound healing complications. Furthermore, there were no signs of neurological deficit, recurrent disc herniation, or persistent pain requiring additional interventions.

In conclusion, this 50-year-old male with chronic low back pain and a large disc herniation at the L4-L5 level underwent a successful discectomy procedure. He had a smooth postoperative course without any complications and showed significant improvement in his symptoms following the surgery.
