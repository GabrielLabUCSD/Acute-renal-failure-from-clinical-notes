Patient is a 55-year-old female who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. She is currently on medications including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. Patient reports a surgical history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy in the past. 

In preparation for her upcoming surgery, the patient had routine preoperative testing including complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrocardiogram, which were all within normal limits. She was also found to have an elevated hemoglobin A1c level of 8.5%, indicating poor glycemic control. 

During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The procedure lasted approximately two hours and was achieved without any significant intraoperative complications. The surgeons noted the presence of some mild adhesions in the surgical field, likely a result of the past abdominal surgeries. 

Following surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) where she was closely monitored for any signs of complications such as respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability. She remained stable throughout her stay in the PACU and was subsequently transferred to the surgical ward for postoperative care. 

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. She received appropriate pain management with a combination of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She was encouraged to ambulate early to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. 

Regarding her diabetes management, the patient's blood glucose levels were monitored closely and managed with a sliding scale insulin regimen. Her blood sugars remained within target range for the duration of her hospital stay. 

The patient's wound was monitored and cared for regularly, showing no signs of infection or dehiscence. She had regular visits from the wound care nurse to ensure proper healing. 

Postoperative laboratory tests, including complete blood counts and liver function tests, showed no significant abnormalities. Her renal function tests remained stable throughout her hospital stay. 

On the second day post-surgery, the patient developed mild postoperative nausea and vomiting, likely due to the effects of anesthesia. She was managed with antiemetic medications and experienced resolution of her symptoms within 24 hours. 

The patient was discharged on the fourth day post-surgery with appropriate discharge instructions, including wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. She was advised to follow up with her primary care physician in two weeks for a postoperative check-up. 

Despite the patient's overall smooth postoperative course, she experienced a urinary tract infection two weeks after her surgery. The infection was treated with a course of antibiotics and resolved without any complications. 

In the following months, the patient continued to recover well and reported improved glycemic control with a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.9% at her six-month follow-up appointment. She reported no further complications related to the surgery. 

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia, who underwent surgery without significant intraoperative complications. Her postoperative course was generally uneventful, with only mild postoperative nausea and vomiting. She developed a urinary tract infection after discharge, which was successfully treated. Overall, the patient had an uncomplicated recovery with improved glycemic control noted at her follow-up appointment.
