The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an abdominal hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes medications for these conditions, including lisinopril and atorvastatin. His blood pressure has been well controlled on this regimen, with no recent episodes of elevated readings. He does not have a history of diabetes or kidney disease.

The patient underwent a preoperative evaluation, which included a physical examination and laboratory tests. The examination revealed a well-nourished male with an appropriate body mass index. His vital signs were stable, and there were no signs of acute illness. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, were within normal limits.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has not undergone any major surgeries in the past. He did have his appendix removed in childhood. He has a positive family history of surgical complications, with his mother experiencing wound infections after a previous surgery.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. He tolerated the surgery well and regained consciousness in the recovery room without any issues. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not require any blood transfusions. He was closely monitored for pain control and received appropriate analgesics as needed.

As for complications, the patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications, such as surgical site infection, bleeding, or organ injury. However, on postoperative day 2, he developed a fever of 101.4Â°F, with associated chills and increased pain at the surgical site. Upon further evaluation, it was determined that he had developed a surgical site infection. The wound was promptly cleaned, and he was started on antibiotics to treat the infection.

The patient responded well to the antibiotics, and the fever subsided within 48 hours. He remained afebrile thereafter and exhibited signs of improved wound healing. The wound was monitored closely, and daily dressing changes were performed to ensure proper healing and prevent further infection.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful, despite the development of a surgical site infection. He was discharged home on postoperative day 6 with appropriate wound care instructions and a prescription for an extended course of oral antibiotics. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and surgeon for further evaluation and management.
