The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history that includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been on medication for his hypertension and diabetes for the past 10 years. His blood pressure is well controlled and his diabetes is managed with oral medications. He has a history of smoking, but quit 5 years ago. He has a pack-year history of 20.

The patient had a mild myocardial infarction five years ago and underwent a coronary angioplasty with stenting. He had an uneventful recovery from the procedure and has been asymptomatic since. His most recent stress test was negative for any ischemia or arrhythmias.

His hyperlipidemia is managed with statin therapy and his LDL cholesterol levels have been within target range for the past two years. He has no history of other significant cardiovascular events or procedures. His current medication regimen includes lisinopril, metformin, amlodipine, rosuvastatin, and albuterol inhaler as needed for his COPD.

The patient has a history of chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis. He has tried conservative measures including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but the pain has persisted. His orthopedic surgeon has recommended a total knee replacement to improve his mobility and quality of life.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He has a baseline hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL and a normal platelet count. His creatinine levels have been stable over the past year, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 75 mL/min/1.73m². He has no symptoms of urinary or renal dysfunction.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m², indicating obesity. His cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or extra heart sounds. Pulmonary examination reveals mild expiratory wheezing bilaterally.

The patient has been counseled on the risks and benefits of the surgery. He understands the need for appropriate preoperative preparation, including discontinuing antiplatelet agents prior to the procedure. He has been advised to continue taking his regular medications up until the day of surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to have a typical recovery course. He will be started on prophylactic antibiotics before surgery and continue them for 24 hours postoperatively. He will also receive deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for the duration of his hospital stay.

Pain control will be managed with a multimodal approach, which may include opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and regional anesthesia techniques. Physical therapy will be initiated early to help the patient regain strength and improve range of motion in his knee.

Potential complications of the surgery include infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound healing issues, and stiffness or instability of the knee joint. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of these complications postoperatively.

The patient's hospital stay is expected to be approximately 2-3 days, depending on his progress. He will be discharged with pain medications, instructions for wound care, and a prescription for outpatient physical therapy. He will have a follow-up appointment with his orthopedic surgeon in 2 weeks to assess his progress.

To prevent acute renal failure, the patient's fluid balance will be carefully monitored during the perioperative period. Renal function will be assessed preoperatively and postoperatively to ensure there are no signs of renal impairment.
