The patient is a 55-year-old male who recently underwent surgery for a hernia repair. The surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia and lasted for approximately two hours. Prior to the surgery, the patient had a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood tests, chest X-ray, and ECG, all of which were within normal limits.

The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with antihypertensive medications. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes that is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. His blood glucose levels were well-controlled preoperatively, with a fasting blood glucose of 110 mg/dL.

The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 30, which categorizes him as overweight. He has a sedentary lifestyle but denies any significant respiratory or cardiac symptoms. He has never smoked and does not consume alcohol. He has no known drug allergies.

On physical examination prior to surgery, the patient appeared well-nourished and in no acute distress. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally, and cardiac examination was within normal limits. Abdominal examination revealed a reducible hernia, with no signs of incarceration or ischemia.

The patient was informed about the surgical procedure, its potential risks, benefits, and alternatives. Informed consent was obtained, and he was counseled about postoperative care, including pain management, early ambulation, and possible complications such as bleeding, infection, and wound dehiscence.

Following surgery, the patient was transitioned to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring and recovery. He tolerated the surgery well and had stable vital signs throughout the postoperative period. Postoperatively, he received appropriate analgesia to manage postoperative pain, and his pain scores remained within acceptable limits.

The patient was encouraged to ambulate early and received instructions on wound care and postoperative precautions. He was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. His postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day.

During the follow-up visit, the patient experienced no significant complications related to the surgery. The incision site appeared well-healed with no signs of infection or dehiscence. He reported minimal pain, which was managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine postoperative care.

In summary, the patient underwent successful hernia repair surgery without any acute complications. His preoperative medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both of which were well-controlled. He had a BMI within the overweight range and had no significant respiratory or cardiac symptoms. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he had a smooth recovery, with no complications noted.
