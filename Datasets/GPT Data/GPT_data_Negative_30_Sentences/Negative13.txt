The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, who is planning to have surgery. He has been taking antihypertensive medications and statins for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia respectively, and Metformin for his diabetes. He has a history of good compliance with his medications.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent chest pain on exertion for the past six months. In order to further evaluate his symptoms, he underwent a series of tests, including an exercise stress test, which showed ischemic changes on EKG. A subsequent coronary angiogram revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

Upon consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon, it was decided that the patient would benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery to alleviate his symptoms and improve his long-term outcome. The patient was assessed by the anesthesia team and deemed fit for surgery, with an ASA physical status classification of II.

Prior to the surgery, the patient underwent comprehensive preoperative evaluation, including laboratory tests, echocardiography, and pulmonary function tests. His results were within normal limits except for slightly elevated fasting blood glucose levels, which were managed by adjusting his Metformin dosage.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and the CABG procedure was performed without any complications. A total of three coronary artery bypass grafts were placed, including an arterial graft.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours and then transferred to a regular hospital room. He was managed with a combination of intravenous pain medications, antibiotics, and antiplatelet therapy. Chest X-rays were obtained to ensure proper ventilation and absence of any complications like pneumothorax.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with gradual improvement in his pain and overall condition. He was able to tolerate a regular diet within 48 hours of surgery and was ambulating with assistance. His vital signs remained stable, with no signs of infection or wound complications.

Daily rounds were conducted by the surgical team, who were pleased with the patient's progress. Physical therapy was initiated to help the patient regain strength and mobility. Respiratory therapy was also implemented to encourage deep breathing and prevent respiratory complications such as atelectasis.

After five days of hospitalization, the patient was deemed fit for discharge and was provided with detailed instructions for his at-home care. He was prescribed several medications including beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, and statins to optimize his cardiovascular health. In addition, he was advised to follow a strict diabetic diet and given a follow-up appointment in four weeks to monitor his glycemic control.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, with no major complications observed. He responded well to treatment and his surgical wound healed without any signs of infection. The surgical team was satisfied with the outcome, and the patient expressed satisfaction with his improved symptoms and quality of life.
