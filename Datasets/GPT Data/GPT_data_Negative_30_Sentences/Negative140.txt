The patient is a 64-year-old male, with a past medical history significant for hypertension and high cholesterol. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a history of myocardial infarction in his 50s.

He had undergone a stress test last year, which showed no evidence of cardiac ischemia. The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. His cholesterol levels are managed with atorvastatin.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had his gallbladder removed 10 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. He recovered well from that procedure without any complications. There have been no recent hospitalizations or major illnesses.

The patient denies any current symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol excessively. He exercises regularly and follows a balanced diet.

His preoperative laboratory results including complete blood count, renal function panel, and liver function tests were within normal limits. The patient's fasting glucose was also normal, indicating good glycemic control.

An electrocardiogram performed prior to surgery showed normal sinus rhythm and no evidence of significant arrhythmias or ischemic changes. Echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no structural abnormalities.

The surgical team has planned for intravenous antibiotics to be administered prior to surgery for infection prophylaxis. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia, with appropriate monitoring during and after surgery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient will receive regular pain medication to manage pain associated with the surgery. Certain measures, such as early ambulation and deep breathing exercises, will also be taken to minimize the risk of postoperative complications.

The patient will be observed closely for any signs of infection, such as fever, wound redness, or increased drainage. Additionally, his vital signs will be monitored regularly to detect any signs of hemodynamic instability or respiratory distress.

Given his history of hypertension, blood pressure monitoring and optimization will be a priority to prevent any cardiovascular complications. The patient will be instructed to resume his regular antihypertensive medications as soon as tolerated.

In terms of postoperative diet, the patient will initially be on a clear liquid diet, gradually advancing to regular solid foods as tolerated. He will also be provided with dietary instructions to follow after discharge, focusing on balanced nutrition and maintaining a healthy weight.

The surgical team will ensure appropriate pain management and will closely monitor the patient's incision site for any signs of infection or delayed wound healing. They will provide instructions on wound care and when to seek medical attention.

Within the first 24 hours post-surgery, the patient will be mobilized to enhance recovery and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. Compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression devices may be utilized for this purpose.

The patient's recovery will be closely followed with regular postoperative appointments to assess wound healing, monitor blood pressure, review laboratory results, and address any concerns or questions. The surgeon will also evaluate the hernia repair site to ensure it is healing properly.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any significant postoperative issues. He recovered well from surgery, and his pain was managed appropriately with analgesics. There were no signs of infection or wound healing problems, and he did not develop any urinary retention or gastrointestinal complications.

It is important to note that the patient did not experience acute renal failure as a complication. Adequate renal function was maintained during his hospital stay. Efforts were made to ensure optimal hydration and appropriate medication adjustments to prevent any renal issues.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgical experience with an uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged in stable condition and advised on appropriate follow-up care. The surgical intervention effectively addressed his hernia, and he can expect a full recovery with continued adherence to postoperative instructions and regular monitoring.
