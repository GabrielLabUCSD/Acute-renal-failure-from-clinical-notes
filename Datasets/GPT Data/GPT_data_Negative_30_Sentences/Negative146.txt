Patient X is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. He has been managed on oral antihypertensive medications and insulin therapy for his diabetes. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 35, which classifies him as obese.

Patient X is scheduled to undergo surgery for a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. He has a history of recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, consistent with biliary colic. His symptoms have not responded to conservative management, prompting the decision for surgical intervention.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, Patient X has a history of smoking, with a pack-year history of 20. He acknowledges this as a risk factor and has attempted several quit attempts, but has been unsuccessful thus far.

His preoperative workup includes routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies. His electrolytes, liver function tests, and renal function are within normal limits. He has a baseline eGFR of 82 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

A preoperative chest x-ray reveals clear lung fields with no evidence of consolidation or effusion. His electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave changes. An echocardiogram demonstrates normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55%.

Patient X has been evaluated by the anesthesiology team, who deemed him a moderate risk for surgery. His obesity increases the risk for perioperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and difficulty with intubation during anesthesia induction. Appropriate measures, including venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, positioning, and airway management strategies, have been discussed.

Preoperatively, Patient X has been instructed to continue his antihypertensive medications and insulin therapy, except for oral hypoglycemic agents, which have been temporarily discontinued. He has also been advised to stop smoking at least 2 weeks prior to surgery to optimize lung function and decrease the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

Patient X undergoes an uneventful cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, no complications are encountered, and the gallbladder is successfully removed laparoscopically. The procedure duration was approximately 60 minutes.

During the immediate postoperative period, Patient X is monitored in the recovery room. Vital signs remain stable, including blood pressure and heart rate. His pain is well controlled with analgesics, and he is advised on deep breathing exercises and early ambulation to prevent postoperative complications like atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

Patient X is transferred to a surgical ward for continued postoperative care. He is started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advances to a regular diet as tolerated. His incisions are well-approximated, without signs of infection or dehiscence. Drain output is minimal, and he does not experience any postoperative bleeding or hematoma formation.

The nursing team closely monitors Patient X's urine output, which remains within normal limits, eliminating concern for postoperative acute renal failure. His urine is clear and without any color changes. Daily laboratory tests reveal stable electrolyte levels and liver function.

Patient X's analgesic requirements decrease gradually, and he is eventually transitioned from intravenous opioids to oral pain medications. His mobility improves, and he is able to ambulate without assistance. Physical therapy is initiated to optimize his recovery and prevent muscle wasting.

On postoperative day 3, Patient X is discharged home with appropriate instructions for wound care and medication management. He is advised to continue his antihypertensive medications and closely monitor his blood glucose levels. Smoking cessation counseling is reinforced, and he is referred to smoking cessation resources for ongoing support.

Overall, Patient X had a successful surgery and an uneventful postoperative course. He did not experience any complications such as surgical site infection, bleeding, or wound complications. His recovery was aided by pain management, early ambulation, and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory tests. It is important for Patient X to continue with regular follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing and management of his chronic medical conditions.
