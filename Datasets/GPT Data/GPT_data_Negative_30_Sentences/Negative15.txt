During preoperative evaluation, the patient had routine laboratory tests including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, which were all within normal limits. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, while his chest x-ray was unremarkable. The patient's pulmonary function tests indicated good lung function, with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 85% of predicted.

In terms of postoperative course, the patient tolerated the surgery well and had an uneventful immediate recovery in the post-anesthesia care unit. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery to prevent surgical site infections. The patient was encouraged to walk and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's pain was controlled with a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform regular leg exercises to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment two weeks post-discharge to assess his surgical incision and overall recovery.

In conclusion, the patient's surgical procedure went well, with no significant intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. He tolerated the surgery and anesthesia without any issues and had an unremarkable recovery. The patient's main postoperative complication was a mild ileus, which was successfully managed. Overall, the patient's medical history and preoperative evaluation indicated good health, contributing to a positive surgical outcome.
