His surgical procedure is scheduled for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in the left knee. The patient has been experiencing chronic pain and difficulty with mobility, impacting his quality of life. 

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including laboratory investigations. His blood work revealed normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count. His renal function, liver function, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. His coagulation profile showed no abnormalities. 

The patient's preoperative chest X-ray showed clear lung fields, with no evidence of acute or chronic lung disease. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and his echocardiogram revealed no significant abnormalities. 

During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and underwent a successful total knee replacement procedure. The surgical team reported no complications or difficulties during the surgery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room. He was monitored closely for vital signs, pain control, and any signs of postoperative complications. The patient's pain was managed with a combination of IV opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 

The patient was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any surgical site infections. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin injections was initiated. His urine output and renal function were monitored closely to ensure adequate kidney function and prevent any postoperative acute renal failure.
