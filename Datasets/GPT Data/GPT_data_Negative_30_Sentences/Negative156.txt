Furthermore, the patient has a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He has been taking a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) as needed for symptom relief.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an uncomplicated cholecystectomy 8 years ago. There were no complications, and the recovery was uneventful.

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with a body mass index (BMI) of 27. His blood pressure is consistently within the target range, and his heart rate is regular. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and without any palpable masses.

Preoperative laboratory results show a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests. The patient's creatinine level is 0.92 mg/dL, urea nitrogen is 20 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating normal kidney function.

Other relevant preoperative tests, such as chest X-ray and electrocardiogram, were performed and found to be within normal limits. The patient also underwent an echocardiogram, which showed normal left ventricular function without any valvular abnormalities.

The patient has been educated about the surgery, and all his questions and concerns have been addressed. He has given informed consent and is psychologically prepared for the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient's recovery has been smooth and uneventful. Vital signs have remained stable, and there have been no signs of surgical site infections. Pain management has been effectively addressed with a multimodal approach, including patient-controlled analgesia.

The patient's diabetes management has continued without major disruptions. Blood glucose levels have been monitored closely, and insulin therapy has been adjusted accordingly to maintain glycemic control.
