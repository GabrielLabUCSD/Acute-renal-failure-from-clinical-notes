The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presents with the need for surgery, and his preoperative evaluation reveals well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. His current medications include metoprolol for hypertension and metformin for diabetes.

The patient underwent a thorough preoperative assessment which included a physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Blood work showed normal renal function, liver function, and hematological profiles. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram demonstrated no abnormalities. The patient was deemed to be a suitable candidate for surgery.

During the operation, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and monitored closely throughout. The surgery itself was uneventful, and the patient tolerated it well. He was transferred to the recovery room following the procedure, where vital signs were stable and pain control was managed appropriately.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for any signs of complications, such as infection, bleeding, or thrombosis. He received prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis as per institutional protocols. The surgical wound was assessed daily and showed no signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient's postoperative course was largely unremarkable. He experienced mild pain at the surgical site, which was controlled with oral analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and blood clots.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained well-controlled. He continued to take his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications as prescribed. The patient's renal function was monitored closely, and no significant changes were noted.

As the patient recovered, he was gradually transitioned from intravenous to oral pain medications. He demonstrated good oral intake and had no complications with bowel movements. Dietary restrictions were lifted, and he was advised to consume a well-balanced diet.

Upon discharge, the patient was given detailed instructions for wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments. He was advised to gradually resume his daily activities and refrain from heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for a specified period.

Over the subsequent weeks, the patient's wound healed without any signs of infection or delayed healing. He reported a progressive improvement in pain and regained his normal range of motion. The patient attended all follow-up appointments and had no further concerns.

In summary, this 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 underwent surgery without any intraoperative complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, with well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. The patient had no complications such as wound infection, thrombosis, or bleeding. His pain was effectively managed with oral analgesics, and he made a satisfactory recovery without the development of acute renal failure.
