The patient is a 45-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The patient had a myocardial infarction two years ago and underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. He is currently taking aspirin, a statin, metformin, and lisinopril for these conditions.

Additionally, the patient has a history of obesity with a body mass index of 34, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis. He has tried conservative management for his knee pain, including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but was unable to achieve adequate pain control. As a result, he and his orthopedic surgeon have decided to proceed with knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a comprehensive medical clearance evaluation. His blood pressure is well-controlled with a systolic blood pressure consistently below 130 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg. His blood glucose levels have been well-regulated with a current HbA1c of 6.8%. The patient's lipid profile is also within the target ranges, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol below 100 mg/dL.

The patient's renal function has been stable, with a serum creatinine consistently around 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate above 60 mL/min/1.73mÂ². He has no history of acute renal failure or chronic kidney disease. Urinary analysis shows no evidence of proteinuria or hematuria.

Given his sleep apnea, the patient was referred for a preoperative evaluation in the sleep medicine clinic. A polysomnogram confirmed moderate obstructive sleep apnea, and he was prescribed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. The patient has been compliant with CPAP therapy, reporting improved quality of sleep and daytime alertness.

In terms of surgery, the patient's orthopedic surgeon has explained the risks and benefits of knee replacement. The patient understands the procedure and has been instructed on preoperative preparations, including discontinuing aspirin and managing his diabetes medication regimen. He will be admitted to the hospital the day before surgery and undergo a preoperative assessment by the anesthesiologist.

The patient underwent successful knee replacement surgery without any immediate intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he was monitored closely for pain control, wound healing, and prevention of complications such as deep vein thrombosis and infection. The patient received appropriate pain management through a multimodal approach, including opioid medications, non-opioid analgesics, and regional anesthesia techniques.

He began physical therapy on the first postoperative day to aid in early mobilization and rehabilitation. The patient demonstrated good effort and compliance with his physical therapy exercises and was able to achieve weight-bearing ambulation with the assistance of a walker by the third day.

During his hospital stay, the patient's blood glucose levels were monitored frequently and managed with insulin therapy to maintain levels within the target range. There were no episodes of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, and his HbA1c remained stable.

The patient's recovery was uneventful, and he did not experience any postoperative complications such as wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. His pain was well-controlled, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any gastrointestinal issues.

As part of his postoperative care, the patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with ongoing physical therapy and a plan for outpatient follow-up. He was educated on signs and symptoms of infection, the importance of adhering to his diabetes and hypertension medications, and the use of compression stockings for deep vein thrombosis prevention.

In conclusion, the patient, a 45-year-old male with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic knee pain, underwent successful knee replacement surgery with an uneventful postoperative course. He followed appropriate preoperative preparations, was closely monitored postoperatively, and received adequate pain management. The patient's blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid profile remained within target ranges throughout his hospital stay. His renal function was stable, with no evidence of acute renal failure. The patient was discharged home with physical therapy and a plan for outpatient follow-up.
