The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He presents with symptoms of severe osteoarthritis in his left hip joint, causing debilitating pain and limited mobility. Previous conservative management options, including physical therapy and analgesics, failed to provide significant relief. After discussing the available surgical options with the patient, he has decided to undergo left hip arthroplasty.

The patient's preoperative assessment reveals a body mass index (BMI) of 35, elevated blood pressure readings, and poorly controlled blood glucose levels. His HbA1c levels are consistently above 8%. He has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. His preoperative laboratory tests show no abnormalities, including kidney function tests.

During the surgical procedure, the orthopedic surgeon performed a left hip arthroplasty without any intraoperative complications. The patient was administered general anesthesia and received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. The surgery lasted for approximately 3 hours, and the patient tolerated it well.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room and subsequently shifted to the orthopedic ward. He received postoperative analgesia through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids. Physical therapy started on the first postoperative day, focusing on range of motion exercises and ambulation.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain gradually decreased, and he was able to achieve partial weight-bearing ambulation with the help of a walker. His blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and adjustments were made to his insulin regimen to maintain stable glycemic control. Blood pressure readings remained elevated, and the primary care physician adjusted his antihypertensive medications accordingly.

The patient's wound was assessed daily and remained clean and free from signs of infection. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis was initiated in the form of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin injections. Regular postoperative laboratory tests were conducted, including complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and renal function tests, all of which remained within normal limits.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient experienced a sudden onset of hematuria. A urologist was consulted, and after further evaluation, it was determined to be a self-limiting urinary catheter-associated hematuria. No other complications were identified during the patient's hospital stay.

The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day with instructions for wound care, physical therapy exercises, and a comprehensive plan for glycemic and blood pressure control. He was advised to follow up with both the orthopedic surgeon and his primary care physician in two weeks.

During the follow-up visits, the patient demonstrated steady progress in terms of pain relief, ambulation, and glycemic control. His blood pressure was better controlled with the adjusted medications. Repeat imaging studies confirmed successful left hip arthroplasty placement, without signs of infection, dislocation, or implant failure.

The patient reached his six-week postoperative period without any major complications. He continued physical therapy exercises at home and gradually transitioned to using a cane for ambulation. In terms of renal function, no concerns were noted throughout the entire course of his treatment.

In summary, the patient underwent uneventful left hip arthroplasty for severe osteoarthritis. He experienced a self-limiting urinary catheter-associated hematuria during his hospital stay but had an otherwise uncomplicated postoperative course. His pain, mobility, glycemic control, and blood pressure management all improved after surgery, contributing to a successful outcome.
