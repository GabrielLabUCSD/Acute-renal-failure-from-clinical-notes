Surgery is scheduled for the following week. The patient is counseled regarding the procedure, potential risks, and expected postoperative course. He understands the risks and consents to the surgery. 
The patient undergoes a total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia. The procedure is uneventful, lasting approximately two hours. There are no intraoperative complications. 
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is monitored closely in the recovery room. He is given appropriate pain medication to manage his postoperative pain. 
He is started on a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent any surgical site infections. Physical therapy is initiated on the first postoperative day to aid in early mobilization and enhance recovery.

The patient continues with physical therapy to further improve his range of motion and strength. He is counseled regarding the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including weight reduction, which can reduce stress on his knee joint. 
At the six-week follow-up visit, the patient demonstrates excellent progress in his recovery. He is able to walk independently and perform most of his activities without any significant limitations. His surgical incision is fully healed.
