The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with chronic back pain. He has a history of degenerative disc disease and has tried conservative management without success. After a thorough evaluation, it was determined that surgery is the best option for him.

His medical history is significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He does not have any known allergies to medications. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent various imaging studies, including MRI and X-rays, which confirmed the presence of multiple herniated discs and spinal stenosis. He also underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood tests, EKG, and a pulmonary function test, all of which were within normal limits.

The patient underwent surgery, specifically a laminectomy and discectomy at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels, to alleviate his symptoms and improve his quality of life. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and his vital signs remained stable throughout the surgery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where he received close monitoring. He was able to tolerate clear liquids, and his pain was managed using a patient-controlled analgesia pump with intravenous opioids. The patient was encouraged to ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy, which helped him regain mobility.

The patient's postoperative course was largely uneventful. He was discharged on postoperative day 3 with instructions for wound care and a prescription for oral pain medications. He was advised to gradually increase his activity level and avoid any strenuous physical activities for several weeks.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any major postoperative complications such as infection or wound dehiscence. However, he did have a minor complication in the form of constipation, which was managed with stool softeners and dietary modifications.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled for the patient to monitor his progress and assess his pain levels. Additionally, he was referred to physical therapy for a structured rehabilitation program to further improve his functional status.

Overall, the surgery was successful in relieving the patient's chronic back pain and improving his quality of life. He had an uncomplicated postoperative course, aside from the minor issue of constipation, which was successfully managed. The patient is expected to make a full recovery and return to his regular activities with time and appropriate rehabilitation.
