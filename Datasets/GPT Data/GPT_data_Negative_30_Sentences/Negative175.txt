The patient is a 55-year-old female who has a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis.
She is scheduled to undergo surgery for chronic knee pain and limited mobility.
Her blood pressure has been adequately controlled with antihypertensive medications.
She manages her diabetes with oral antidiabetic medications, and her blood glucose levels have been stable.
The patient has a history of knee arthroscopy performed 10 years ago due to a sports-related injury.
She does not have any known allergies to medications or anesthesia.
A preoperative assessment revealed no significant abnormalities in her laboratory test results.
Her hemoglobin A1c level was within the target range, indicating good long-term glucose control.
She has been a nonsmoker for the past 15 years.
The patient has been informed about the surgical procedure, its benefits, risks, and possible complications.
The surgeon discussed the expected postoperative course, including pain management and physical therapy.
The patient has been encouraged to engage in preoperative exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee joint.
She has been instructed to discontinue oral antidiabetic medications the day before surgery and manage her blood glucose with insulin.
The patient is expected to have a smooth intraoperative course under general anesthesia.
The surgical team will use prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.
Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for adequate pain control and stable vital signs.
She will work with a physical therapist to regain strength and range of motion in the knee joint.
The patient will be discharged home once she is able to move around independently and manage her pain with oral analgesics.
A follow-up appointment has been scheduled for two weeks after surgery to evaluate the surgical site and monitor the patient's progress.
The patient is at a moderate risk of developing venous thromboembolism due to her age and immobility during the postoperative period.
Therefore, she will receive prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin.
Proper deep vein thrombosis prevention measures, such as early mobilization and compression stockings, will also be implemented.
To manage her chronic knee pain postoperatively, the patient will receive a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids.
She will be closely monitored for potential adverse effects of these medications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory depression.
The surgical incision will be evaluated regularly for signs of infection, such as erythema and purulent discharge.
The patient will be advised to keep the incision clean and dry and report any abnormal symptoms promptly.
The risk of postoperative wound infection is low, as the surgery will be performed under aseptic conditions using sterile techniques.
In terms of complications, the patient will be closely monitored for signs of postoperative bleeding or hematoma formation.
She will be educated about signs and symptoms of infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism to seek immediate medical attention if necessary.
The patient is expected to have a smooth postoperative course with adequate pain control and improvement in knee function.
As of now, there are no anticipated complications mentioned in the medical history.
However, acute renal failure is not considered a postoperative complication at this time.
Overall, the patient's surgical plan and postoperative care have been carefully planned to ensure the best possible outcome.
