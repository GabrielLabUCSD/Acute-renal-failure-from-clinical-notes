The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a significant medical history. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has been managing his hypertension and diabetes with medication. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and has a 20-pack year smoking history.

The patient has been experiencing worsening joint pain in his right knee for the past year, limiting his mobility. He has tried conservative management with pain medications and physical therapy without significant improvement. Due to the persistent pain and functional limitation, the patient has elected to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

His preoperative workup included a comprehensive medical evaluation, including cardiac and pulmonary assessments. He underwent a series of blood tests, including complete blood count, renal function panel, and coagulation profile, which were all within normal limits, except for a mild anemia.

The patient is scheduled for surgery in two weeks and has been advised to stop smoking to reduce postoperative complications. His primary care physician has referred him to a smoking cessation program to support his efforts. The patient has expressed motivation to quit smoking and has started attending counseling sessions.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital, and his vital signs were stable. Anesthesia was induced, and the surgery proceeded without any intraoperative complications. The total knee replacement procedure was performed successfully.

The patient was closely monitored during the postoperative period. He received appropriate pain management with a combination of analgesics and was encouraged to start early ambulation and physical therapy. He experienced some postoperative pain, but it was well controlled with medication.

During his hospital stay, the patient had a stable postoperative course. He was closely monitored for any signs of infection, thromboembolic events, or respiratory complications. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin was administered as needed to maintain optimal glycemic control.

The patient was started on a prophylactic antibiotic regimen and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent any potential postoperative infections and blood clots. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to prevent postoperative respiratory complications.

On the third day after surgery, the patient was able to walk with the assistance of a physical therapist. He continued to make progress with physical therapy and was discharged from the hospital one week after the surgery.

During the follow-up visits, the patient reported gradual improvement in pain and mobility. He diligently attended physical therapy sessions and followed the prescribed home exercises. His wound was well healed, and there were no signs of infection.

Despite initial concerns, the patient did not experience any major complications during the postoperative period. His blood glucose levels were well controlled, and he did not develop any respiratory complications. There were no signs of deep vein thrombosis or surgical site infection.

At the one-month follow-up, the patient's knee range of motion had significantly improved, and he reported minimal pain with daily activities. He expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and stated that his quality of life had improved. He continued to remain committed to his smoking cessation efforts and had successfully quit smoking since the surgery.
