He tolerated the procedure well without any intraoperative complications.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room. He regained consciousness without any issues and his vital signs remained stable. He was monitored closely for any signs of bleeding, infection, or cardiovascular complications. Intravenous fluids and pain medications were administered as needed. Bloodwork was ordered, including a complete blood count and coagulation profile.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was transferred to the surgical floor after a few hours. He was able to tolerate a regular diet without any nausea or vomiting. Physical therapy was initiated to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises regularly.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's wound was clean with no signs of infection. He continued to have stable vital signs and his laboratory results remained within normal limits. The patient was started on oral pain medications and anticoagulation prophylaxis. The surgical team closely monitored his wound healing process and instructed him on proper incision care.

The patient was seen by a physical therapist daily to help with mobilization and rehabilitation. He was encouraged to continue his usual medications, including those for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's blood glucose levels were kept in target range with sliding scale insulin. 

No complications, such as wound dehiscence, seroma formation, or postoperative bleeding, were noted during the patient's hospital stay. He did not experience any cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. 

On the third postoperative day, the patient's surgical wound showed signs of healing, and he was discharged home. He was provided with appropriate wound care instructions and was given a follow-up appointment for a postoperative visit. The patient was advised to continue with his regular medications and to gradually increase his activity level as tolerated. 

During the outpatient follow-up visit, the patient reported good pain control and minimal discomfort at the incision site. His vital signs were normal, and his surgical wound was healing well without any signs of infection. The patient was pleased with the outcome of the surgery and had regained his preoperative level of functioning.

In summary, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of well-controlled hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and stable coronary artery disease. He underwent surgery without any intraoperative complications and had an uneventful recovery. His postoperative course was characterized by stable vital signs, normal laboratory results, and proper wound healing without complications. The patient's pain was well-controlled, and his mobility improved with physical therapy. He did not experience any postoperative complications, and his overall outcome was successful.
