The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presents with symptoms of severe knee osteoarthritis, which has significantly impaired his mobility and quality of life. Conservative management, including physical therapy and NSAIDs, has been unsuccessful in providing adequate relief.

Upon examination, significant joint tenderness, swelling, and impaired range of motion were noted. X-rays revealed advanced osteoarthritis with significant joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. As a result, the decision was made to proceed with a total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's preoperative workup included routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and electrocardiogram. All results were within normal limits, indicating no immediate contraindication to surgery. A consultation with the anesthesiologist confirmed his eligibility for general anesthesia due to his stable medical condition.

During surgery, the orthopedic surgeon successfully performed a total knee replacement, removing the diseased joint and replacing it with a prosthetic implant. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and no intraoperative complications were encountered.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where he was monitored closely for pain control, vital signs, and potential complications. He received intravenous opioid analgesics and regional anesthesia to manage his pain effectively. Physical therapy was initiated shortly after he regained consciousness to promote early mobilization and prevent postoperative complications.

Over the course of several days, the patient demonstrated gradual improvement in pain control, mobility, and activities of daily living. He received frequent visits from the physical therapy team, who helped him regain strength and range of motion in his new knee joint. Laboratory tests, including hemoglobin and electrolyte levels, were monitored regularly and remained within normal limits.

The patient's postoperative course was largely uneventful, with no signs of wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. However, he did develop a transient postoperative fever, which resolved with supportive management and did not require further intervention.

In terms of wound care, the surgical incision was inspected daily for signs of redness, swelling, or drainage. The patient was instructed on proper dressing changes and given appropriate antibiotics as a preventive measure. His surgical staples were removed on postoperative day 10, and the incision exhibited good healing with no signs of dehiscence or infection.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient received a prophylactic regimen of anticoagulation to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Sequential compression devices were also utilized to enhance venous blood return. These interventions proved effective in preventing thrombotic events during his recovery.

As the patient continued to recover, physical therapy sessions were gradually reduced, and his range of motion and strength improved significantly. He was able to bear weight on his operated leg and perform activities of daily living independently. Following a multidisciplinary team approach, the patient's pain was effectively managed using a combination of oral analgesics and physical therapy modalities.

Upon discharge, the patient was provided with a comprehensive home exercise program to ensure continued progress in his rehabilitation. He was scheduled for regular follow-up appointments with his orthopedic surgeon to assess his healing, monitor for potential complications, and guide his rehabilitation progress.

In summary, the patient underwent successful total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, with no major complications encountered. With appropriate pain management and physical therapy, he demonstrated significant improvement in pain control, mobility, and functionality. The patient's overall outlook is optimistic, and he is expected to regain full function in his knee joint with continued rehabilitation.
