The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently on medications including amlodipine, atorvastatin, and metformin for these conditions. He reports no known allergies to medications or latex.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient mentioned a family history of heart disease, with his father undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery in his 60s. The patient denies any symptoms of angina or shortness of breath at rest or with exertion. He reports occasional mild chest discomfort related to indigestion and finds relief with antacids.

In terms of lifestyle, the patient admits to being a current smoker with a 30-pack year history. He states that he has tried quitting in the past but has been unsuccessful. He consumes alcohol occasionally but denies any excessive or daily intake. The patient mentions having a balanced diet and exercises occasionally, but does not have a regular exercise routine.

His surgical history includes an appendectomy performed in his teenage years and a hernia repair five years ago, both without any complications or significant issues during the postoperative period.

On physical examination, his blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg, heart rate is 75 bpm, and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. The patient is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/mÂ². Auscultation of the heart reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Laboratory results show a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c level of 8.5%. His complete blood count, renal function tests, and liver function tests are within normal limits. His lipid panel demonstrates a total cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 120 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL.

Considering the patient's medical history and risk factors, a stress test and echocardiogram were performed to assess his cardiac status. Both the stress test and echocardiogram results were normal, showing no evidence of significant ischemia or valvular abnormalities.

Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and surgical clearance was given by the anesthesiology team. The patient was instructed to discontinue his metformin medication 24 hours prior to the surgery. He was advised to shower with a chlorhexidine-based soap the night before and morning of the surgery to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period and was closely monitored in the recovery room. He was able to tolerate clear liquids and ambulate without difficulty. In terms of pain management, he received intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed.

On postoperative day 1, the patient developed a mild surgical site infection with localized erythema and increased wound drainage. The wound was cleaned, and appropriate antibiotics were initiated. The infection resolved without any further complications, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with oral antibiotics.

During the postoperative period, the patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin therapy was initiated. He was provided with education on diabetic control and medication management.

In summary, this 55-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes underwent surgery without acute renal failure as a complication. However, he experienced a mild surgical site infection postoperatively, which was successfully treated with antibiotics. The patient was discharged home in stable condition and is scheduled for a follow-up appointment to ensure complete resolution of the infection and continued management of his chronic conditions.
