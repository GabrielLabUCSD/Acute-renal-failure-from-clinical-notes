The patient is a 55-year-old male who was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been on antihypertensive medications since then. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and has been taking statins for the past 5 years. The patient has a 20 pack-year smoking history and quit smoking 3 years ago. He has a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.

The patient underwent a coronary angiogram 2 months ago, which showed significant stenosis in three coronary arteries. Due to the severity of the stenosis, the patient is scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery next week. He has been thoroughly counseled about the procedure and its potential risks and benefits.

In terms of comorbidities, the patient has osteoarthritis in both knees, which causes difficulty in walking long distances and climbing stairs. This has limited his physical activity over the past few years. The patient also has mild renal impairment, but does not require hemodialysis or any specific renal interventions.

Prior to the surgery, the patient's medications were adjusted. His antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications were continued, and he was instructed to temporarily stop aspirin and clopidogrel one week prior to the surgery. The patient was also referred to a physiotherapist to optimize his respiratory function and enhance postoperative recovery.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and underwent a successful CABG procedure. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for the first 24 hours. He was extubated the following day and transferred to a regular surgical ward.

In the postoperative course, the patient experienced mild-to-moderate pain, which was managed with analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate and progressively increase his physical activity under the guidance of a physical therapist. The patient's respiratory function was closely monitored, and he received incentive spirometry and respiratory exercises to prevent postoperative respiratory complications.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period, with no episodes of fever or hypotension. Blood work was monitored daily, and although there was a mild elevation in inflammatory markers, they gradually normalized without signs of infection.

The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively, with no significant changes from his baseline. He was placed on a restricted fluid intake to ensure optimal hydration and prevent volume overload.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day with appropriate discharge instructions. He was instructed to continue his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, as well as aspirin and clopidogrel for dual antiplatelet therapy. The patient was advised to follow up with his cardiologist and undergo cardiac rehabilitation to enhance his recovery and improve his exercise tolerance.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any major complications postoperatively. There were no signs of wound infection, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, or respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis. Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery.
