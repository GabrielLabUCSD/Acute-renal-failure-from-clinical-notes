Patient X had a preoperative evaluation that included a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. His laboratory results were within normal limits. 

During the postoperative course, Patient X had an uneventful recovery. He was closely monitored for any signs of surgical site infection, and all wound dressings were clean and intact. 

Patient X received appropriate pain control following surgery and was given prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any postoperative infection. His vital signs remained stable throughout the hospital stay, with no significant fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate. 

Physiotherapy was initiated to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and atelectasis. Patient X actively participated in the physiotherapy sessions, following the instructions of the therapist.
