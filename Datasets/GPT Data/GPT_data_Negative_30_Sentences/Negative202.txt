The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has been managed with medication for his hypertension and glucose control for his diabetes, with his most recent HbA1c level being 7.2%.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy at the age of 20 and a tonsillectomy as a child. He has no known allergies or adverse reactions to anesthesia. His preoperative laboratory investigations include a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation profile, and an electrocardiogram (ECG), all of which were within normal limits.

He has been stable on his current antihypertensive medication, lisinopril, which is continued throughout the perioperative period. As for his diabetes management, he is on metformin, which was temporarily held on the day of surgery due to fasting requirements. His blood glucose levels have been monitored preoperatively and were well-controlled with no significant fluctuations noted.

The patient was seen by the anesthesiologist prior to surgery. His physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities, and he was assessed to be at an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of II (mild systemic disease). He was informed about the risks, benefits, and alternative options of anesthesia and provided with informed consent.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia without any complications. His vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure. The surgery went well, with repair of the hernia achieved successfully without any intraoperative complications noted.

The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring. His blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory status were closely monitored, and he was provided with appropriate pain management. Initially, he experienced some postoperative pain, which was managed with intravenous opioids.

In the PACU, the patient's blood glucose levels remained stable, and his vital signs gradually returned to baseline. He was able to tolerate oral intake and ambulated with assistance. His pain was controlled with oral analgesics, and he was discharged home on postoperative day one with a prescription for oral pain medication.

The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and surgeon for routine postoperative care. He was educated on potential signs of surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, and symptoms of complications that should prompt immediate medical attention.

During the postoperative period, the patient's recovery was uneventful. He reported minimal pain, and his incision site appeared clean and healing well. His blood pressure and glucose levels remained within normal limits. He resumed his regular antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications.

The patient attended his follow-up appointments as scheduled, and his surgical site was documented to be healing without signs of infection. He reported no postoperative complications, such as bleeding, fever, or difficulty with bowel movements. The surgeon advised him to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for a few weeks, gradually resuming his normal routine as tolerated.

In summary, this 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes underwent a successful hernia repair surgery without any intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. His recovery has been uncomplicated, and he is gradually returning to his regular activities with no evidence of surgical site infection or other complications.
