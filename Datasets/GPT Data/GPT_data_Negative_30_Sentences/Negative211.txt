The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. The patient has been taking medication for these conditions and has been compliant. He does not have a history of diabetes or kidney disease. His surgical history is noncontributory. The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.

On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. His blood pressure is well controlled, but he is overweight with a BMI of 32. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs appreciated. Lung examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Laboratory studies show normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. His renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 100 mL/min/1.73mÂ². Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes. Chest X-ray is unremarkable, showing clear lung fields and normal cardiac silhouette.

The patient has been cleared for surgery and is scheduled for a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. The patient is educated about the risks and benefits of the surgery and provides informed consent. Preoperative measures are taken to prevent surgical site infections, including perioperative antibiotics and skin preparation.

The surgery is performed without any complications. The patient is extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). In the PACU, the patient's vital signs remain stable, and he is monitored closely for any signs of postoperative complications. He is able to tolerate a clear liquid diet and ambulate within a few hours.

The patient is then transferred to the surgical ward for further postoperative management. Pain is managed with intravenous opioids initially and then transitioned to oral pain medication as the patient tolerates. He is encouraged to practice deep breathing exercises and ambulate to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

During his hospital stay, the patient's postoperative course is uneventful. He is gradually advanced to a regular diet and experienced normal bowel movements. Wound healing is progressing well, without any signs of infection. The patient is actively engaged in his care and follows instructions provided by the healthcare team.

On postoperative day three, the patient is discharged home with appropriate pain medication and wound care instructions. He is advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine follow-up and removal of sutures. The patient is educated about signs and symptoms of complications and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if any arise.

In the postoperative period, the patient does not experience any significant complications, such as surgical site infections, wound dehiscence, or pulmonary complications. His recovery is deemed successful, and he continues his regular medications for his chronic medical conditions.

It is important to note that the patient did not develop acute renal failure or any other renal complications during the perioperative period. Close monitoring of renal function was done, and the patient's renal parameters remained within normal limits throughout his hospital stay.

In conclusion, the patient, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, underwent a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. His postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications observed. Renal function was maintained within normal limits, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day three. He will continue to follow up with his primary care physician for routine care.
