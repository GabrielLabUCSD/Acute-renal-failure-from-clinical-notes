In terms of his medication regimen, the patient also takes a daily aspirin as a cardiovascular prophylaxis. He has been on this regimen for the past two years without any major bleeding incidents or adverse effects. The surgical team plans to continue the aspirin perioperatively without interruption.

His preoperative laboratory results are within normal limits, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. He is not anemic, and his liver and kidney functions are within the normal range.

Regarding his preoperative imaging studies, the patient underwent a chest X-ray which showed no acute abnormalities. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant changes. Additionally, his echocardiogram demonstrated preserved left ventricular systolic function and no valvular abnormalities.

The surgical procedure the patient is scheduled to undergo is an elective hernia repair. The surgeon explained the procedure in detail, including the potential risks and benefits. The patient understands the procedure and has provided informed consent.

The patient is scheduled to have the surgery under general anesthesia. The anesthesiology team reviewed his medical history and determined him to be at average risk for anesthesia-related complications. They plan to administer general anesthesia using a balanced technique, closely monitoring his vital signs throughout the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring. Pain control will be achieved with intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics as needed.
