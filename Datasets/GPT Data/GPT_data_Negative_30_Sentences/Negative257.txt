The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. The patient has a history of smoking for the past 20 years and is currently on antihypertensive medications and oral hypoglycemic agents for diabetes management. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 34, indicating severe obesity.

The patient's pre-operative evaluation reveals controlled blood pressure with a current reading of 130/80 mmHg. His fasting blood glucose level is within target range at 120 mg/dL. His renal function tests show a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, indicating normal kidney function. However, his HbA1c level is elevated at 8.5%, suggesting poor long-term blood glucose control.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals no acute abnormalities, and his electrocardiogram is normal. However, he reports occasional shortness of breath with exertion. Pulmonary function tests show mild restrictive lung disease, likely related to his obesity. The cardiovascular examination reveals an irregular heart rhythm but without any significant murmurs or other abnormalities.

In terms of surgical risk, the patient's age, obesity, smoking history, and comorbid conditions increase his overall perioperative risks. Arrangements have been made for an anesthesiologist to assess the patient, ensuring optimal management during the surgery. The patient has been instructed to stop smoking and follow a strict diabetic diet in preparation for the procedure.

Following surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was monitored closely for pain control, wound healing, and signs of infection. He was started on incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis. The patient was discharged on the third day post-surgery with appropriate postoperative instructions.

During the follow-up visits, the patient demonstrated good wound healing with no signs of infection. His pain was well-controlled with prescribed analgesics. He was advised to adhere to his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications and to quit smoking completely. The patient was also referred to a nutritionist to help with weight management and dietary modifications.

Although the patient did not experience any immediate complications, his long-term outcomes may be affected by his comorbid conditions, especially diabetes and obesity. Efforts will be made to optimize his blood glucose control and manage his hypertension to reduce the risk of future complications.

In summary, the patient with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity is planning to undergo hernia repair surgery. His pre-operative evaluation shows controlled blood pressure but poor diabetic control. The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, with good wound healing and pain management. Efforts will be made to optimize long-term outcomes by managing his comorbid conditions.
