Renal function tests are within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient has been advised to discontinue his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications temporarily before the surgery. Preoperative clearance from the cardiologist and endocrinologist has been obtained to ensure medical optimization before the surgical procedure. The patient has been calmed and reassured about the risks and benefits of the surgery, and he has provided informed consent.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). He was started on intravenous fluids and analgesics for pain management. His vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period, with no evidence of significant hemodynamic instability. The surgical wound was inspected regularly, and appropriate dressing changes were performed. He was encouraged to practice deep breathing exercises and to ambulate within his tolerance in order to prevent postoperative complications.

His pain was well-controlled with oral analgesics, and the surgical team was satisfied with his progress. On day three post-surgery, he was successfully transitioned to oral pain medications and was cleared to be discharged home with appropriate postoperative instructions.

In summary, this 55-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is planning to undergo surgery. His chronic medical conditions are well-controlled with medications, and he has been optimized preoperatively. His surgical course was uneventful, and he did not experience any major complications.
