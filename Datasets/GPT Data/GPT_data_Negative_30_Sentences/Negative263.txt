Patient X is a 60-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a lumbar disc herniation. The patient's hypertension is well controlled on a combination of metoprolol and lisinopril. His diabetes is managed with metformin and insulin, and his hemoglobin A1c levels are within the target range. Patient X had a previous myocardial infarction two years ago, which was managed conservatively and has not had any recurrent cardiac events since. He had a coronary angiogram that revealed significant coronary artery disease, but he declined further intervention at that time.

In terms of his surgical history, Patient X underwent an appendectomy twenty years ago without any complications. He had a vasectomy five years ago and experienced no difficulties during or after the procedure. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly.

During the preoperative assessment, Patient X underwent a comprehensive medical evaluation, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a chest X-ray, all of which were within normal limits. His preoperative electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave changes or evidence of ischemia.

The patient has been instructed to stop taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and any anticoagulants one week prior to surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding complications. He has been advised to continue taking his regular medications with a small sip of water on the morning of surgery.

Patient X is expected to have an uneventful surgical procedure, with adequate anesthesia and pain management. In the immediate postoperative period, he will be closely monitored for any signs of surgical site infection or bleeding. In order to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), he will receive prophylactic subcutaneous heparin injections and be encouraged to perform leg exercises and ambulation.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to be smooth, with gradual improvement in pain and functional ability. He will receive physical therapy to aid in his recovery and prevent muscle atrophy. His blood sugar levels will be closely monitored to avoid any hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic episodes. Patient X will be closely followed up by both the surgical and medical teams to address any concerns or complications that may arise.

Complications that can potentially occur postoperatively include wound infection, hematoma formation, nerve injury, or impaired wound healing. Patient X will be educated about the signs and symptoms of these complications and instructed to report any abnormalities promptly.

In terms of renal function, the patient's preoperative creatinine level was within normal limits, indicating adequate kidney function. Acute renal failure is not anticipated as a complication in this case, based on the patient's medical history and renal function assessment.

In summary, Patient X, a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease, is scheduled for lumbar disc herniation surgery. His preoperative evaluation reveals well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. His surgical and medical history suggests a low-risk profile for complications. The patient is expected to have an uneventful postoperative course, although he will be closely monitored for any signs of infection, bleeding, or other possible complications. Acute renal failure is not a concern based on the patient's normal renal function.
