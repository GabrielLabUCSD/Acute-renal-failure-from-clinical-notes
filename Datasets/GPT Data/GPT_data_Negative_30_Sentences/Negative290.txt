Patient X is a 60-year-old male who presents with a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He currently takes lisinopril and metformin for his respective conditions. The patient has been experiencing chronic knee pain for several years due to osteoarthritis and has elected to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Over the past year, Patient X has tried conservative management options such as physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections without significant relief. His knee pain severely limits his mobility and daily activities, leading to a diminished quality of life.

Preoperatively, Patient X has undergone a thorough medical evaluation including a cardiopulmonary assessment. His overall health status is stable, with no recent hospitalizations or surgeries. He is a non-smoker and denies any history of drug allergies. Lab tests show his fasting blood glucose is well-controlled, and his renal function is within normal limits.

The surgical team has discussed the procedure with Patient X, explaining the risks and benefits of total knee replacement surgery. The patient has provided informed consent, understanding the potential complications such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and postoperative pain.

On the day of surgery, Patient X is taken to the operating room and put under general anesthesia. The orthopedic surgeon performs a successful total knee replacement, removing the damaged joint surfaces and replacing them with prosthetic components. The procedure lasts approximately 2 hours, and the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.

In the PACU, Patient X is monitored closely for any signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, or respiratory distress. His vital signs remain stable, and he is provided with appropriate pain management to ensure optimal comfort. The patient is transferred to the orthopedic surgical unit later in the day for further recovery and care.

Throughout the postoperative course, the healthcare team closely monitors Patient X's vital signs, pain levels, and overall recovery. Physical therapy is initiated to help restore joint range of motion and strengthen the surrounding musculature. The patient is encouraged to ambulate with assistance using a walker, gradually increasing his weight-bearing as tolerated.

Patient X's postoperative recovery progresses well without any major complications. He demonstrates good pain control, and his surgical incision remains clean and free of signs of infection. With rehabilitation, his knee range of motion improves steadily, and he is able to perform activities of daily living independently.

During the hospital stay, Patient X received venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. His blood glucose levels are closely monitored, and his antidiabetic medications are adjusted accordingly to maintain adequate glycemic control.

After four days, Patient X is medically stable and ready for discharge. He is educated on the importance of continued physical therapy and prescribed pain management medications for use as needed. The patient is advised to follow up with his primary care physician in one week and with the orthopedic surgeon in six weeks for routine postoperative assessment.

Patient X's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any significant complications such as wound infection, thromboembolic events, or cardiac issues. He achieved his goal of reduced knee pain and improved mobility, leading to an enhanced quality of life.
