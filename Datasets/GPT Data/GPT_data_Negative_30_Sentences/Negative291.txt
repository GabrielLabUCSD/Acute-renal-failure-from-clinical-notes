The patient is a middle-aged individual with a history of chronic back pain due to degenerative disc disease. They have tried various conservative treatments, such as physical therapy and pain medications, but have not experienced significant relief. After thorough evaluation, it has been determined that the patient would benefit from surgical intervention to address their back pain.

In addition to back pain, the patient has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. They also have a family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient does not smoke and has a BMI within the normal range. Their exercise tolerance is limited due to their back pain.

Laboratory tests revealed normal renal function and coagulation parameters. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram showed no significant abnormalities, but there was evidence of mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest X-ray was unremarkable.

The patient was scheduled for a surgical procedure to address the degenerative disc disease. The procedure involved removing the affected disc and fusing the adjacent vertebrae. Preoperative counseling and informed consent were obtained, explaining the benefits, risks, and potential complications of the surgery.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived in a fasting state and was appropriately consented. They received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and were placed under general anesthesia for the duration of the procedure. The procedure was uneventful and lasted approximately two hours. Blood loss during surgery was minimal.

The patient's postoperative course started in the recovery room, where they were monitored closely. They received intravenous fluids and pain medication as needed. Postoperative analgesia was carefully managed to balance effective pain control and minimizing side effects. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and ambulate as tolerated to prevent postoperative complications.

Throughout their hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable. They had no signs of infection such as fever or elevated white blood count. The surgical wound was monitored, and there were no signs of dehiscence or discharge. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet without any gastrointestinal disturbances.

Physical therapy was initiated on the second day after surgery. The patient received guidance on proper body mechanics and was assisted in gradually increasing their activity level. They were able to tolerate the therapy well and demonstrated good compliance with the program.

Throughout their hospital stay, the patient reported acceptable pain control. The pain was effectively managed with a combination of oral and intravenous pain medications. The patient's pain levels were monitored regularly using a standardized pain scale.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was discharged home with appropriate discharge instructions. They were advised to continue taking their regular medications and to follow up with their primary care physician for wound checks and medication adjustments.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no significant complications noted. They did not experience any respiratory or cardiovascular issues. The surgical wound healed well without any signs of infection. The patient reported improved pain control and overall satisfaction with the surgical outcome.

In conclusion, the patient's history of chronic back pain, along with their medical history of hypertension, was managed well during the perioperative period. The surgical procedure was successful in addressing their underlying condition, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
