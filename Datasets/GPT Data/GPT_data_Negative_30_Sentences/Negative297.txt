The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient has been managing his hypertension with medication for the past 10 years. He is currently taking lisinopril and amlodipine to control his blood pressure. 

In addition, the patient has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years. He is on a regimen of metformin and sitagliptin to manage his blood glucose levels. 

The patient also has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which he takes atorvastatin to control his cholesterol levels. 

He has undergone a coronary angioplasty five years ago to treat a blockage in one of his coronary arteries. 

The patient's surgical procedure is planned to address a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. 

His pre-operative laboratory results show a normal blood count, liver function, and kidney function except for mildly elevated creatinine levels, which have been stable over the past year. 

The patient has been advised to discontinue his metformin 48 hours before the surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis. 

He will continue taking his other medications up until the day of surgery, with the guidance of his surgeon and anesthesiologist. 

The patient is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse. 

He has no known drug allergies or adverse reactions to medications. 

His vital signs have been stable during the pre-operative evaluation. 

The patient has provided informed consent and has a good understanding of the risks and benefits of the surgery. 

He has received pre-operative instructions regarding fasting and has been advised to avoid eating or drinking for at least 8 hours before the surgery. 

The surgery is scheduled to take place in the morning, and the patient is expected to be discharged the following day, pending a satisfactory post-operative course. 

Post-operatively, the patient is closely monitored for pain control and wound healing. 

He is started on a regimen of acetaminophen and NSAIDs for pain management. 

The patient is encouraged to engage in early mobilization and physical therapy to prevent complications such as blood clots and muscle weakness. 

His surgical wound is inspected daily for signs of infection or dehiscence. 

The patient's blood glucose levels are monitored closely during the post-operative period to ensure optimal glycemic control. 

He is provided with diabetes-specific discharge instructions, including dietary modifications and medication adjustments. 

The patient is discharged home with a prescription for physical therapy and precautions to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next few weeks. 

He is instructed to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a post-operative check-up. 

In the post-operative period, the patient experiences no complications related to the surgery. 

He has good pain control and is able to achieve adequate mobility and function. 

However, on post-operative day three, the patient develops a urinary tract infection. 

He presents with urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria. 

A urine culture confirms the diagnosis, and he is started on a course of antibiotics. 

The urinary tract infection resolves without any further complications. 

Overall, the patient's post-operative course is uneventful, except for the development of a urinary tract infection, which is promptly treated.
