The patient is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for an abdominal hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient takes medications including lisinopril for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for cholesterol management, and metformin for diabetes management. 

In terms of surgical history, the patient had a cholecystectomy 5 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. The surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient recovered well without any significant postoperative complications. The patient also had a appendectomy 10 years ago following an acute appendicitis episode. This surgery also went smoothly, and the patient experienced an uneventful recovery.

Prior to the current surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, which included laboratory workup such as complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram. These tests revealed no abnormalities or concerns that would lead to postponing or canceling surgery. The patient had a normal chest X-ray, indicating no pulmonary pathology.

On examination, the patient appeared to be in good general health. His vital signs were stable, and he had no symptoms of infection or pain in the surgical site.

The patient was informed about the risks and benefits of the surgery, and he provided informed consent. He was counseled on the importance of cessation of smoking and alcohol use prior to the procedure to minimize intraoperative and postoperative complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the postoperative recovery area. His vital signs remained stable, and he regained consciousness without any issues. The patient was closely monitored for pain, bleeding, and signs of infection.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was started on intravenous antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. He was also prescribed oral pain medications to manage postoperative pain. The patient was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent deep vein thrombosis and aid in the recovery process. The surgical wound was dressed appropriately, and the patient was instructed on wound care and signs of wound infection to monitor at home.

The patient's initial postoperative course was unremarkable, with no major complications occurring. He remained in the hospital for a recommended duration of 2 days for close monitoring and wound care.

At the one-month postoperative visit, the patient reported feeling fully recovered and able to resume his daily activities without limitations. His wound had completely healed without any complications. The patient showed no signs of hernia recurrence or any new symptoms related to the surgery.
