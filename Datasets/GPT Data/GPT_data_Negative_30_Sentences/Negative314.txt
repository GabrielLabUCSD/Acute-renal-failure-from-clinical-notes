The patient is a 60-year-old male who has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease. He has a history of smoking for 30 years and presents with shortness of breath and chest pain upon exertion. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant blockages in his coronary arteries. As a result, he is scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, for which he takes medication. He has no known allergies to medications or any other medical conditions. He has undergone a colonoscopy in the past and was found to have several benign polyps, which were removed during the procedure. His family history is significant for heart disease, with his father having had a heart attack at the age of 55.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a preoperative assessment, including a complete blood count, chemistry panel, and coagulation studies, which were all within normal limits. His cardiac function was evaluated with an echocardiogram, which showed reduced ejection fraction of 40%.

On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The surgical team performed a median sternotomy and harvested the saphenous vein from the patient's leg for use as a graft. Multiple bypass grafts were created to bypass the blocked coronary arteries. The surgery was successful, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was extubated and started on pain management. He was monitored closely for any signs of infection, bleeding, or respiratory distress. Chest X-rays were obtained to ensure proper lung expansion and to rule out any complications such as pneumothorax. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was gradually weaned off of intravenous medications.

Over the course of his hospital stay, the patient received physical therapy to promote early mobility and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He was also started on aspirin and a statin medication for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. The patient's pain was well-controlled with a combination of oral and intravenous medications.

The patient's postoperative course was largely uneventful, with no significant complications observed. His incision site remained clean and free from signs of infection. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and had regular bowel movements. The patient's cardiac function improved postoperatively, with his ejection fraction increasing to 50%.

Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient was advised to continue his medications as prescribed and to follow up with his primary care physician. He was also instructed to adhere to a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. The patient was provided with a list of warning signs of a heart attack and instructed to seek medical attention immediately if he experiences any of them.

In conclusion, the patient successfully underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery for his coronary artery disease. His postoperative course was unremarkable, with no complications observed. The patient was discharged with appropriate instructions for continued management of his cardiovascular health.
