The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for the removal of a suspected tumor on his right lung. He has a history of smoking, consuming approximately a pack per day for the past 30 years, but quit six months ago. He has a past medical history of hypertension, for which he takes medication, and has been otherwise healthy.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy 10 years ago and had no complications. His preoperative labs showed normal complete blood count, renal function, liver function, and coagulation profiles.

The patient's vital signs on admission were stable, with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds over the right lung base with dullness on percussion.

Chest x-ray revealed a mass in the right lower lobe of the lung, which was further characterized by a computed tomography (CT) scan. The CT scan showed a 4 cm mass with no evidence of metastasis. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan was negative for distant metastasis.

The patient underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the removal of the lung tumor. The procedure was uneventful, and the mass was successfully excised. Intraoperative frozen section analysis revealed a benign lesion. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.

The postoperative course was uncomplicated, with the patient being extubated in the PACU and transferred to the surgical ward the next day. The patient's pain was well controlled with intravenous opioids initially, which were transitioned to oral analgesics. Chest physiotherapy was initiated to promote lung expansion and prevent complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.

The patient was ambulating on the second postoperative day and was able to tolerate a regular diet. He was closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications, including infection, bleeding, or respiratory distress. Serial chest x-rays were obtained to ensure adequate lung re-expansion.

No complications were observed during the hospital stay, and the patient's condition continued to improve. He was discharged on the fourth postoperative day with oral pain medications, instructions for proper wound care, and a follow-up appointment with the surgeon in two weeks.

During the follow-up visit, the patient was doing well, with no signs of infection or wound complications. The surgical incisions were healing appropriately, and the patient had returned to his normal activities. The final pathology report confirmed a benign tumor, providing reassurance to the patient.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of smoking and hypertension who underwent a VATS for the removal of a benign lung tumor. The surgery was successful, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course without any complications. The patient's pain was well managed, and he was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. The pathology report confirmed the tumor's benign nature, providing further reassurance to the patient.
