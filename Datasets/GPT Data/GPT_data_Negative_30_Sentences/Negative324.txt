He has been on bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids to manage his COPD. He occasionally experiences exacerbations, especially during the winter season.

Aside from his chronic conditions, the patient reports occasional lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease. He has tried physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief. The pain is manageable with these measures.

The patient is planning to undergo surgery for a non-emergent hernia repair. He has consulted with his primary healthcare provider and surgeon, who both found him to be fit for surgery. His preoperative evaluation, including blood work, electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray, were unremarkable.

During the postoperative course, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room. He was provided with pain management through intravenous opioids initially and shifted to oral analgesics as his pain subsided. His vital signs remained stable, and no signs of infection or respiratory distress were observed.

The patient was mobilized on the first postoperative day, under the supervision of the nursing staff. He was educated on deep breathing exercises and coughing techniques to prevent any respiratory complications.

The patient's surgical wound was inspected daily for signs of infection. No redness, swelling, or discharge was noted. The wound healing progressed well, and it was found to be clean and dry.

The patient did not experience any complications during his postoperative course. His pain was well managed, allowing him to resume a regular oral diet and ambulate independently. He was discharged home on the second postoperative day with appropriate pain medications and wound care instructions.

During the follow-up visit, the patient reported no adverse events or concerns related to his surgery. His wound had healed completely without any signs of infection. His pain levels had significantly decreased.

In conclusion, the patient with multiple chronic conditions successfully underwent a non-emergent hernia repair surgery without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful and he had a smooth recovery. It is noteworthy to mention that the patient did not develop acute renal failure, which is not an uncommon complication seen after surgeries.
