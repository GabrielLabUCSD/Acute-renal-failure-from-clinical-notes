The patient is a 45-year-old male, with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.

His preoperative evaluation revealed controlled hypertension on amlodipine 5mg daily, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. His lipid panel showed a total cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL, with LDL cholesterol at 120 mg/dL. The patient has been on simvastatin 40mg nightly, resulting in good control of his hyperlipidemia.

The patient reports occasional episodes of exertional chest discomfort, but his cardiac workup, including an exercise stress test and echocardiogram, did not reveal any significant abnormalities. He is planning to continue his cardiac medications perioperatively, as recommended by his cardiologist.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy during childhood and does not have any known drug allergies. He denies smoking or alcohol use and is physically active, engaging in regular exercise for 30 minutes at least three times a week.

As part of the preoperative assessment, routine laboratory investigations were performed. His complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. Renal function tests showed a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73 m².

The anesthesiology team recognized that the patient’s hypertension and hyperlipidemia are well-controlled, with no immediate concerns regarding the anesthetic management. The patient was instructed to continue taking his medications with a sip of water on the morning of surgery.

In the operating room, the surgical team successfully repaired the patient's hernia without any intraoperative complications. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient was stable throughout the operation. Total surgical time was approximately two hours.

Following the procedure, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. He woke up without any grogginess or confusion, and his vital signs remained stable. The patient was monitored closely for any signs of pain, bleeding, or infection at the surgical site.

In terms of postoperative pain control, the patient was initially managed with intravenous opioids in the PACU. As his pain improved, he transitioned to oral acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). He tolerated oral intake without any issues and his gastrointestinal function remained intact.

The patient was discharged home on the second postoperative day following adequate pain control and stable vital signs. He was counseled on wound care, signs of infection, and the importance of following up with his primary care physician for suture removal in one week.

During the postoperative period, the patient did not exhibit any signs of wound infection or dehiscence. He experienced mild incisional pain, which gradually improved over the next two weeks. The patient reported complying with the prescribed pain medications but did not require any additional opioids beyond the first few days.

The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not develop any major complications such as postoperative bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He recovered well and returned to his usual daily activities without any limitations within two weeks of surgery.

Overall, the patient's surgery for hernia repair was successfully completed without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. His medical management, including control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, contributed to a smooth recovery process. The patient reported feeling satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and expressed gratitude for the care provided by the healthcare team.
