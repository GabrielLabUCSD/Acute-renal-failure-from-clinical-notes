This is a summary of the medical history of a patient who is planning to have surgery. The patient has a complex medical history with various conditions and prior surgeries. The aim of this summary is to provide a comprehensive overview of the patient's preoperative course, the surgical procedure itself, and the postoperative period, including any potential complications.

The patient, a 60-year-old male, has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history. Additionally, he has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery five years prior. He has been compliant with his medications, including aspirin and statin therapy.

Upon presentation, the patient complained of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough with purulent sputum, and increased wheezing. Pulmonary function tests revealed severe obstructive lung disease, with decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and decreased forced vital capacity (FVC). A high-resolution CT scan of the chest confirmed the presence of emphysematous changes.

Based on clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed with severe COPD exacerbation. He was initiated on inhaled bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics. His symptoms gradually improved over the course of two weeks.

Given the chronic and severe nature of his COPD, surgical intervention has been recommended. The patient is scheduled for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the management of his emphysematous bullae. The procedure aims to excise the bullae and improve lung function.

In preparation for surgery, he underwent an extensive preoperative evaluation. His cardiopulmonary status was assessed, including a stress echocardiogram, which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 55% without any significant ischemic changes. Pulmonary function tests were repeated, confirming the need for surgery.

The patient was started on incentive spirometry and deep-breathing exercises to optimize lung function. Additionally, smoking cessation counseling was provided to address his prior smoking history. The patient expressed understanding and commitment to quit smoking permanently.

On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The procedure was completed successfully, with excision of multiple emphysematous bullae identified in both lungs. The estimated blood loss was minimal, and no complications were noted intraoperatively. He was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.

During the postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress, oxygen saturation, and hemodynamic stability. Adequate pain management was ensured, utilizing a multimodal approach. Early ambulation was encouraged to prevent postoperative complications, such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient showed gradual improvement in his respiratory function and was weaned off supplemental oxygen by the third day postoperatively. Pulmonary toilet measures, including chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry, were continued to prevent atelectasis and promote lung expansion.

Daily chest X-rays were obtained to assess lung re-expansion and rule out any complications such as pneumothorax. The patient remained afebrile with no signs of infection. His supplemental oral intake was adequate, and he was successfully transitioned to a regular diet.

In terms of his postoperative course, the patient did not experience any significant complications such as pneumonia, wound infection, or respiratory failure. He was discharged home on postoperative day five in stable condition, with appropriate follow-up scheduled.

In conclusion, this patient with a complex medical history underwent a VATS procedure for the management of emphysematous bullae. The surgical intervention was successful without any intraoperative complications. The patient showed an uneventful postoperative course, with steady improvement in respiratory function and no complications observed.
