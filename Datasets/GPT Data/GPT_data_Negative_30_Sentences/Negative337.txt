The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with a need for surgery due to chronic knee pain and limited mobility. His preoperative evaluation reveals elevated blood pressure, well-controlled blood sugar levels, and a stable renal function. The patient's past surgeries include an appendectomy at the age of 15 and a hernia repair at the age of 30. He has a known allergy to penicillin, which is properly documented in his medical records.

In terms of medications, the patient takes metformin and lisinopril for his diabetes and hypertension, respectively. He also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain relief. His latest blood work results indicate a normal complete blood count, lipid profile, and liver function. His electrocardiogram shows no signs of cardiac abnormalities.

During the procedure, the patient receives appropriate anesthesia tailored to his medical condition. The surgery is successful and lasts approximately two hours. The patient requires postoperative pain management with a combination of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical therapy is initiated immediately after surgery to promote mobility and aid in the patient's recovery.

Within the first 24 hours post-surgery, the patient experiences mild postoperative pain and swelling around the surgical site, which is considered normal. He is monitored closely for any signs of infection, such as fever or increased inflammatory markers. The patient's vital signs remain stable, and there are no signs of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain improves significantly, and he resumes a regular diet. He is encouraged to stay hydrated and maintain a balanced nutrition to aid in the healing process. The nursing staff ensures adequate wound care, infection prevention, and patient education regarding postoperative care.

On the fourth day post-surgery, the patient develops a urinary tract infection (UTI) with typical symptoms such as increased urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria. The patient is started on an appropriate antibiotic regimen and his urine culture confirms the presence of Escherichia coli. The infection resolves after one week of treatment, and the patient's renal function remains stable throughout.

Apart from the UTI, the patient experiences an uneventful recovery after surgery, with no other major complications. He demonstrates good compliance with physical therapy and achieves satisfactory range of motion in his knee joint. The patient is discharged on the tenth day post-surgery with a follow-up appointment scheduled for two weeks later. The surgeon emphasizes the importance of continuing with prescribed medications and adherence to physical therapy exercises at home.

In conclusion, the patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and previous surgeries, including an appendectomy and hernia repair. He is allergic to penicillin. The surgical procedure is successful, and the patient experiences mild pain and swelling postoperatively. He develops a UTI on the fourth day but responds well to treatment. No acute renal failure is observed, and the patient's recovery is uneventful, achieving satisfactory outcomes in terms of pain relief and range of motion.
