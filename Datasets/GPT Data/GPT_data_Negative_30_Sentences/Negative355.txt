The patient in question is scheduled to undergo surgery and has a comprehensive medical history that needs to be considered. The individual has no known drug allergies. They are a 60-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been managed on antihypertensive medications, including lisinopril and amlodipine, to control their blood pressure. Their diabetes is well-managed with metformin, and their lipid levels have been controlled with atorvastatin.

The patient has a history of smoking for over 30 years but successfully quit five years ago. They report consuming alcohol occasionally, but not in excessive amounts. The patient also has arthritis, primarily affecting their knees, which has caused significant pain and mobility issues. They have been using over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, for pain relief.

Aside from these conditions, the patient has a positive family history of coronary artery disease, as their father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. The patient is asymptomatic for angina or any cardiovascular symptoms. The patient's preoperative workup included an ECG, which showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities, and an echocardiogram, which revealed a normal ejection fraction with no evidence of valvular abnormalities.

The patient had routine blood work done, which showed hemoglobin A1c within target range (6.9%), and normal renal and liver function tests. The patient's renal function is worth noting as there is no evidence of acute renal failure or chronic kidney disease.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has no previous surgical procedures. However, they have had multiple dental procedures, including tooth extractions and root canal treatments, without any complications. They have not experienced any excessive bleeding or clotting issues in the past.

The patient's current surgical plan involves a total knee replacement due to the progressive and debilitating nature of their arthritis. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. The patient has been instructed to stop taking their antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the day of surgery, with the exception of metformin, which will be held for 48 hours postoperatively.

Following the surgery, the patient is expected to have a postoperative course involving pain management with a combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Physical therapy will be initiated on postoperative day one to facilitate early mobilization and optimize functional outcomes. The patient will also receive deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to decrease the risk of blood clots.

Although the patient's postoperative course was uneventful initially, they experienced a wound infection five days post-surgery. The infection was treated with a course of antibiotics, and wound care measures were implemented. The patient complied with the treatment regimen, and the infection resolved without further complications. Notably, the patient did not develop any acute renal failure during their postoperative course.
