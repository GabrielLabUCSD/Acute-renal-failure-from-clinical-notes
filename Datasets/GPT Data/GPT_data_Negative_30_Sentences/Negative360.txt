Patient X has had episodes of osteoarthritis, mainly affecting his knees and hips, causing chronic pain and limited mobility.

Regarding the surgical procedure, Patient X is scheduled to undergo an elective total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in the right knee. He has met with the orthopedic surgeon, who explained the benefits, risks, and expectations of the surgery. The surgeon also discussed the importance of weight loss, smoking cessation, and optimizing glycemic control before the surgery.

Regarding the postoperative course, Patient X underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery. He experienced moderate postoperative pain, which was managed with a multimodal analgesic regimen. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles around the knee joint.
