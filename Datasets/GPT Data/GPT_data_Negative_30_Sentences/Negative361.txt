The patient is a middle-aged male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient has been on a medication regimen of lisinopril for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for lipid management, and metformin for glycemic control.

Additionally, he has a history of smoking, with a current pack-year history of 20. The patient has been advised to quit smoking due to its detrimental effects on surgical outcomes and postoperative complications.

The patient is allergic to penicillin, with a documented episode of urticarial rash in the past. Alternative antibiotics, such as cefazolin, have been prescribed to avoid a potential allergic reaction during surgery.

Lab work indicated that the patient has well-controlled blood sugar levels, with a recent hemoglobin A1c of 7.0%. His lipid panel shows well-managed cholesterol levels, with LDL within target range.

During the preoperative evaluation, it was noted that the patient is overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 31. He has been advised to lose weight before the surgery to reduce the risk of complications, particularly related to anesthesia.

The patient underwent a preoperative cardiac evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and stress test, which showed no significant abnormalities. His cardiac function was determined to be within normal limits, indicating a low risk for perioperative cardiac events.

His surgical history includes an appendectomy performed 10 years ago, with an unremarkable postoperative recovery. No other major surgeries or documented complications were noted.

The patient's baseline renal function has been stable, with normal serum creatinine levels throughout his medical history. He does not have a history of chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury.

Postoperatively, the patient was initially observed in the recovery room for hemodynamic stability and pain control. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as per institutional guidelines.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild postoperative pain, but it was adequately managed with IV analgesics. He was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues and was encouraged to ambulate on the day of surgery.

The patient was closely monitored for potential complications, such as wound infection, DVT, and pulmonary embolism. Serial physical examinations and laboratory tests were performed to assess any changes in clinical status.

Fortunately, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any significant complications. He showed good wound healing without signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient's pain gradually improved, and he was transitioned to oral pain medications. He was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day, with recommendations for appropriate postoperative care and follow-up.

The patient was advised to continue his regular medications as prescribed, along with additional pharmacological prophylaxis against DVT. He was also instructed to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, dietary modifications, and smoking cessation efforts.

No acute kidney injury or changes in renal function were noted during the postoperative period. The patient's renal function remained stable, with no signs of complications related to the kidneys.

In conclusion, the patient underwent surgery with a medical history that included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He had a history of smoking and was allergic to penicillin. Preoperative evaluation showed well-managed chronic conditions and low perioperative cardiac risk.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no significant complications observed. He had good wound healing and pain control, leading to an early discharge from the hospital. With appropriate postoperative care and lifestyle modifications, the patient is expected to have a successful recovery.
