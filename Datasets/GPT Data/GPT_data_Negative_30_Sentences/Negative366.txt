The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently on medications including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin. The patient is a non-smoker and does not have any known drug allergies.

He has been experiencing chronic joint pain in his knees for the past five years, which has been progressively worsening. Multiple conservative management approaches have been attempted, including physical therapy and steroid injections, but have provided limited relief.

The patient has elected to undergo total knee replacement surgery to alleviate his pain and improve his mobility. He has been counseled extensively about the procedure, including the risks and benefits, and has given informed consent.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy twenty years ago and an elective inguinal hernia repair five years ago. Both surgeries were uneventful, and the patient recovered well without any complications.

Before the knee replacement surgery, the patient underwent preoperative testing, which included a comprehensive blood panel, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. All of these tests came back within normal limits, indicating that he is in good overall health.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the day before the surgery for further preparation. He received intravenous antibiotics as per protocol to prevent any infections during the surgical procedure.

The knee replacement surgery was performed under general anesthesia by an orthopedic surgeon. During the procedure, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, and there were no intraoperative complications reported.

The postoperative course was largely uneventful. The patient was monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit, and his vital signs remained stable. He was started on pain control medications, including opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, to manage postoperative pain.

Physical therapy was initiated on the first day after surgery to promote early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The patient was able to bear weight on the operated knee with the assistance of a walker.

He was discharged from the hospital on the third day after surgery with a prescription for pain medications and a home physical therapy program. The patient was instructed to follow up with his orthopedic surgeon in two weeks for a wound check and suture removal.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or surgical site complications. He also did not develop any signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during his hospital stay.

In the weeks following his discharge, the patient continued to make progress with his physical therapy. He gradually regained mobility in his knee, and his pain level improved significantly. He was able to transition from using a walker to a cane for support.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful, and he did not experience any major complications. He expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and reported improved quality of life due to pain relief and increased mobility in his knee.
