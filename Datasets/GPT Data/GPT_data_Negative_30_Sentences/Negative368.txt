His hypertension is well controlled on medication, and his diabetes is managed with diet and exercise alone. The patient has no history of prior surgeries or known drug allergies.

On physical examination, the patient is otherwise healthy and in good general condition. Laboratory studies show normal renal function, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Preoperative tests, including a complete blood count and coagulation profile, are within normal limits. The patient's electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm.

The patient has been adequately informed about the procedure, its risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options. He has provided informed consent and is mentally prepared for the surgery. He has been instructed to stop taking his antihypertensive medication on the morning of the surgery but to continue managing his diabetes as usual.

The patient is admitted to the hospital the day before the scheduled surgery. He follows all preoperative instructions, including avoiding food and drink after midnight. In the preoperative holding area, the patient receives intravenous fluids and is administered prophylactic antibiotics. Anesthesia is induced smoothly without any complications.

During the surgery, the patient is hemodynamically stable with no significant intraoperative events. The inguinal hernia repair is performed successfully without any complications. The patient is monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and subsequently transferred to the surgical ward.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is kept on a clear liquid diet to promote early bowel function recovery. His vital signs remain stable, and he is able to walk with minimal assistance. Pain control is achieved using a combination of oral analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient's glucose levels are monitored closely, and his diabetes remains well controlled.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's surgical incision shows no signs of infection or dehiscence. He is encouraged to ambulate more frequently and progress his diet to a regular meal plan as tolerated. Bowel function resumes adequately, and no signs of urinary retention are observed.

By the second postoperative day, the patient is mobilizing independently and his pain is well controlled. He is demonstrating normal voiding habits and has no complaints of discomfort. The surgical incision continues to heal well without any signs of infection. The patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, remain within normal ranges.

On the third postoperative day, the patient is discharged home with instructions on wound care and pain management. The patient is instructed to follow up with his primary care physician in one week for a routine postoperative visit. He is also advised to rest, gradually increase his activity level, and avoid heavy lifting for the next few weeks.

Throughout his postoperative course, the patient does not experience any complications related to the surgery. He does not develop surgical site infections, wound dehiscence, or hematomas. The patient's diabetes remains amenable to his usual management regimen, and his blood pressure remains stable without the need for medication adjustment. Overall, the patient's recovery process is considered uneventful, and he returns to his regular activities without any significant limitations.
