The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. He has been managed with medications including metoprolol for hypertension and metformin for diabetes. His diabetes is fairly well-controlled with a recent HbA1c of 7.2%. The patient also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy at night.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 2 years ago and an appendectomy during childhood without any complications. He reported no known drug allergies and denied any history of bleeding disorders or clotting abnormalities.

On physical examination, the patient appears well with a body mass index (BMI) of 35. His vital signs are within normal limits, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed a complete blood count within normal limits and an HbA1c of 7.2%.

Given his medical history and planned surgery, preoperative consultations were conducted with the patient's primary care physician, endocrinologist, and anesthesiologist. The primary care physician ensured the patient's blood pressure was adequately controlled and provided medical clearance for surgery. The endocrinologist recommended adjusting the patient's metformin dose prior to surgery to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. The anesthesiologist conducted a preoperative assessment to evaluate the patient's airway and discuss potential anesthesia options.

The patient underwent the planned surgery, which was an elective laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. The procedure lasted approximately 1 hour, and general anesthesia was utilized. There were no intraoperative complications reported, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room for postoperative monitoring.

In the postoperative course, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he reported minimal pain at the surgical site, which was managed with appropriate analgesics. He was kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for a few hours to allow for recovery from anesthesia. The patient was able to tolerate clear liquids without any signs of nausea or vomiting. On postoperative day 1, he passed gas and had a bowel movement. His surgical wound appeared clean, dry, and intact without any signs of infection. The patient was able to ambulate with assistance and was instructed on deep breathing exercises and early mobilization to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

During the hospital stay, the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were monitored regularly, and medications were adjusted as needed. There were no complications reported, such as wound infections, surgical site bleeding, or adverse reactions to medications. The patient's pain remained well-controlled throughout his hospitalization, and he was discharged on postoperative day 3 with appropriate discharge instructions and prescriptions for pain medication.

In summary, the 45-year-old male patient with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity underwent an uneventful laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. His preoperative and postoperative courses were uncomplicated, and he was discharged on postoperative day 3 in stable condition.
