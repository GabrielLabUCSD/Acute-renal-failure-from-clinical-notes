Patient X is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is scheduled for surgery due to progressive osteoarthritis in his left knee. The patient's preoperative evaluation indicates good overall health, with stable blood pressure and cholesterol levels. His diabetes is well-managed with medication, and he has no active infections or respiratory conditions.

In the past, Patient X has undergone cholecystectomy for gallstones and appendectomy for acute appendicitis. He experienced an uneventful recovery from both surgeries. His medication list includes lisinopril for hypertension, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and metformin for diabetes. The patient does not report any known drug allergies or adverse reactions.

During the preoperative period, Patient X has been advised to cease anticoagulant therapy with aspirin one week before surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding. Additionally, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative workup that included laboratory tests, chest x-ray, and an electrocardiogram -- all of which yielded normal results.

Patient X's surgery is planned as an elective procedure with the orthopedic surgery team. The surgeon will perform a total knee arthroplasty to alleviate the patient's chronic knee pain and improve joint function. Rehabilitation post-surgery will involve physical therapy and a gradual return to weight-bearing activities.

Following the surgery, Patient X was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit. He had an unremarkable postoperative course, with stable vital signs and adequate pain management. The patient's incision site showed no signs of infection, and he was consistently able to perform range-of-motion exercises in his knee.

Over the next few days, Patient X remained in the hospital for close observation and further rehabilitation. He received proper wound care and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. Physical therapy sessions were initiated to promote mobility and regain strength in his knee.

The patient's recovery progressed remarkably well, and he was able to achieve full weight-bearing status within a week. Patient X's pain was effectively managed with a combination of non-opioid analgesics and physical therapy modalities. The patient also received counseling on pain management techniques and adherence to the prescribed rehabilitation program.

Throughout his hospital stay, Patient X did not experience any notable complications. His vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or wound infection. His blood glucose levels were consistently within the target range, indicating well-controlled diabetes during the postoperative period.

Patient X was discharged with appropriate pain medications, wound care instructions, and a referral to outpatient physical therapy for continued rehabilitation. He was also advised to follow up with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon at specified intervals to monitor his progress and address any concerns.

In conclusion, Patient X, a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, underwent an uncomplicated elective total knee arthroplasty due to progressive osteoarthritis. He had a favorable postoperative course with adequate pain management, wound healing, and mobility recovery. No complications such as acute renal failure were observed during his hospital stay.
