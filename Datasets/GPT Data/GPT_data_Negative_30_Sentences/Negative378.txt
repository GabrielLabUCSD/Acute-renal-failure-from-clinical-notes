The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has previously undergone an elective cholecystectomy and hernia repair surgeries without any complications. 

He is now scheduled to have an elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in his right knee. The patient has been experiencing progressive pain, difficulty walking, and decreased range of motion in the affected knee. 

During the preoperative evaluation, it was noted that the patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels were well-controlled with medications. His lipid profile was within normal limits. 

The patient has a history of smoking but has quit three years ago. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. 

He underwent routine laboratory tests including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and liver function tests, all of which were within normal limits. His serum creatinine level was 0.9 mg/dL, indicating normal kidney function. 

The patient had a consultation with the anesthesiologist who determined that he is an appropriate candidate for general anesthesia. His airway exam and cardiac evaluation were unremarkable. 

The patient was advised to discontinue his non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) one week prior to surgery to minimize the risk of excessive bleeding. He was also instructed on the importance of deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent complications of immobility.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital and was deemed medically stable for the procedure. He was taken to the operating room, where the surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications. The surgical team reported no issues with the procedure and the patient tolerated it well. 

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room where he was closely monitored for pain, vital signs, and potential postoperative complications. His pain was effectively managed with intravenous pain medications.

Within a few hours, the patient was able to tolerate oral intake and ambulate with assistance. He followed the physical therapy regimen and remained compliant with all the postoperative instructions. 

He received prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively to prevent infection and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent blood clots. Sequential compression devices were applied to his lower extremities to promote blood circulation.

The patient's postoperative course remained uneventful, with no signs of infection, wound dehiscence, or pulmonary complications. He experienced minimal swelling and bruising around the surgical site, which resolved gradually over time.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day four with a prescription for oral pain medications and instructions for home physical therapy. He was advised to follow up with the orthopedic surgeon in two weeks to assess wound healing and discuss the initiation of outpatient physical therapy. 

At the two-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and mobility. His wound was healing well without any signs of infection. The range of motion in his right knee had improved, and he was able to perform most activities of daily living independently. 

He continued his postoperative physical therapy, focusing on strengthening exercises and gait training. The patient was encouraged to gradually increase his activity level while avoiding high-impact exercises and heavy lifting.

During subsequent follow-up visits, the patient continued to show progress in his recovery. He regained near-normal range of motion in his right knee and had minimal pain with weight-bearing activities. His surgical incision was well-healed and showed no signs of infection or other complications.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, with no significant complications. He achieved the desired outcome of improved knee function and pain relief following the total knee replacement surgery.
