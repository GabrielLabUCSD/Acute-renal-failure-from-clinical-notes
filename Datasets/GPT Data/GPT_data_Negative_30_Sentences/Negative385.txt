The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a significant medical history. He has a prior diagnosis of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. Additionally, he has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is also managed with oral medication. The patient has been stable on his current treatment regimen for the past two years.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy 10 years ago and had an uneventful recovery. He has no known drug allergies and does not smoke or consume alcohol.

The patient's current condition has led him to require surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. The hernia has been causing increasing discomfort and interference with his daily activities. The surgical team has determined that surgery is the best course of action to alleviate his symptoms.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation. Routine blood work was done, which revealed normal complete blood count, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and electrolyte levels. His baseline renal function was within normal limits.

The patient was also assessed by an anesthesiologist, who deemed him suitable for general anesthesia. His airway examination and lung function tests were normal. The anesthesiologist's evaluation did not identify any contraindications or increased risks for surgery.

The surgical procedure is planned as an open hernia repair with the use of mesh. The surgeon explained the potential risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient, who provided informed consent.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital in fasting status, as per the provided preoperative instructions. The procedure was completed without any complications, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room.

Postoperatively, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was closely monitored for any signs of pain, infection, or bleeding. The nursing staff administered analgesic medication as needed to manage his pain, which was well-controlled throughout his hospital stay.

The patient was started on a liquid diet shortly after the surgery and gradually progressed to a soft diet as tolerated. His bowel function returned to normal within 48 hours, and he did not experience any postoperative nausea or vomiting.

The surgical wound healing was unremarkable, and there were no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient followed the provided instructions for wound care and kept the area clean and dry.

The patient was observed for any signs of complication, particularly acute renal failure. However, there were no abnormalities noted in his renal function throughout his hospital stay. His urine output remained within normal limits, and there were no signs of fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day with appropriate pain medications and wound care instructions. He was advised to gradually increase his activity level and resume normal daily activities as tolerated. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks later to assess his surgical wound and overall recovery.

In summary, this patient has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both of which are well-controlled. He underwent an appendectomy in the past without complications. He is now scheduled for an inguinal hernia repair. The surgery was completed without any notable issues, and his postoperative course has been uneventful. He did not experience complications, including acute renal failure, and was discharged home with appropriate instructions for recovery.
