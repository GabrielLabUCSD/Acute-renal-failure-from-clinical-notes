His hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin receptor blocker. His diabetes is managed with metformin and lifestyle modifications, with good glycemic control. He has no history of diabetic complications and his HbA1c level is within target range.

Upon physical examination, the patient is obese with a waist circumference of 40 inches. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, heart rate is 75 bpm, and other vital signs are within normal limits. He has no signs of organomegaly, and his cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological systems appear normal.

His kidney function is normal with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and calculated eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m2.

The patient is scheduled for elective surgery to treat his chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis. He has undergone conservative management including physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, all of which provided only temporary relief. The surgery will involve a total knee replacement, and the patient has been thoroughly informed about the procedure, potential risks, and expected benefits.

In the preoperative period, the patient is advised to stop smoking completely to reduce the risk of postoperative complications. He is referred to the smoking cessation program, and nicotine replacement therapy is initiated to aid in smoking cessation. The patient is also educated about the importance of maintaining good glycemic control perioperatively and is instructed to continue taking his antidiabetic medications as prescribed.

The surgery is performed without any complications, and the patient is monitored closely in the immediate postoperative period. He is given appropriate pain management, including a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics. Physical therapy is initiated on the day of the surgery to promote early mobilization and prevent deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with gradual improvement in pain and mobility. He is able to bear weight on the operated leg with the help of crutches. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is continued with low molecular weight heparin for a total of 4 weeks.

The patient is discharged on the fourth postoperative day with appropriate pain medications and a referral for outpatient physical therapy. He is advised to continue his antidiabetic medications and undergo regular follow-up visits to monitor his glycemic control.

During the outpatient follow-up visits, the patient's wound healing is monitored, and the incision site shows no signs of infection. The patient adheres well to his postoperative rehabilitation program and continues to experience improvement in pain and mobility. He remains compliant with his antidiabetic medications, and his glycemic control remains stable.

At the three-month postoperative mark, the patient reports complete resolution of knee pain and significant improvements in his mobility. He is now able to walk without any assistance and resume his daily activities. Repeat laboratory tests reveal no significant changes in his kidney function or glycemic control.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was favorable, with no complications encountered. He made significant progress in his recovery, achieving pain relief and restored function. The patient's commitment to smoking cessation, glycemic control, and adherence to postoperative management contributed to his successful outcome.
