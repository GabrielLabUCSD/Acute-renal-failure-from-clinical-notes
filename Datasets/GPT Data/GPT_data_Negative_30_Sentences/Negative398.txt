The patient met with an anesthesiologist prior to surgery to discuss his anesthesia plan. Due to his medical history of hypertension and diabetes, the anesthesiologist recommended close intraoperative blood pressure monitoring and maintenance of euglycemia during the surgery. The patient was provided with instructions to continue his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the day of surgery with a sip of water.

The surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was extubated at the end of the procedure.
