The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with chronic lower back pain and underwent extensive conservative management that failed to provide relief. He was eventually diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation and was counseled regarding surgical intervention. 

His medical history is significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled on medication, and he has no known allergies. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, indicating obesity. He has been a smoker for the past 20 years, with a 10 pack-year history. 

Preoperative laboratory investigations were within normal limits. His renal function, as indicated by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, was within normal range. 

The patient was scheduled for a microdiscectomy procedure under general anesthesia. The surgical team discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure, including the possibility of complications such as infection, bleeding, nerve injury, and persistence or recurrence of symptoms. The patient understood and provided informed consent.

During the surgery, the patient's vitals remained stable, and intraoperative blood loss was minimal. The surgical team successfully performed the microdiscectomy, removing the herniated disc material and decompressing the affected nerve root.

Upon recovery from anesthesia, the patient was monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit. He reported mild pain at the surgical site, which was effectively managed with analgesics. He was encouraged to start ambulation on the same day of surgery to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and atelectasis.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He was started on a course of physical therapy to aid in his recovery and to prevent recurrent disc herniation. The surgical wound showed no signs of infection, and he had no neurological deficits or wound complications.

During the hospital stay, the patient continued to receive appropriate pain management and was transitioned from intravenous to oral analgesics. His vital signs remained stable, with no signs of postoperative delirium or respiratory complications.

Upon discharge, the patient was provided with instructions for wound care, pain management, and recommended follow-up appointments. He was counseled to quit smoking due to its negative impact on healing and recovery.

During the postoperative follow-up appointments, the patient reported a significant reduction in pain and improvement in his ability to perform daily activities. His surgical wound continued to heal well without any signs of infection or dehiscence.

At the one-month follow-up visit, the patient exhibited complete resolution of his preoperative symptoms. He expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and attributed the success to the surgical intervention and adherence to postoperative instructions.

In summary, a 45-year-old male underwent a microdiscectomy procedure for lumbar disc herniation. His medical history included hypertension, obesity, and a history of smoking. The surgery was successful, with no intraoperative complications. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, experiencing mild pain effectively managed with analgesics. His surgical wound healed without complications, and he reported significant improvement in his symptoms during the follow-up visits. He was satisfied with the surgical outcome and expressed willingness to quit smoking.
