The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. His medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past five years. He has been well-controlled on antihypertensive medications and metformin for diabetes. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse. He has no known allergies to medications or any previous surgeries.

Upon physical examination, the patient appears to be in good general health. His vital signs are within normal limits, and his cardiac and respiratory examinations are unremarkable. The hernia is evident upon inspection and palpation, with no signs of strangulation or infection. The rest of the physical examination is within normal limits.

Laboratory results reveal a fasting blood glucose of 120 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%, and a normal lipid profile. His complete blood count, renal function tests, and liver function tests are all within normal limits. An electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities.

The patient has been advised to continue taking his antihypertensive medications and metformin up until the day of surgery. He has been instructed to stop eating or drinking anything after midnight the night before the procedure. The surgical team has discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient, including potential complications such as infection, bleeding, and recurrence.

On the day of surgery, the patient is brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The surgical team successfully repairs the hernia using a mesh, and the procedure lasts approximately one hour. Intraoperative findings indicate no complications or unexpected findings.

Following surgery, the patient is transferred to the recovery room. He is closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications, such as bleeding, infection, or respiratory distress. Vital signs remain stable throughout the postoperative period, with no signs of fever or wound infection.

The patient is started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. He is encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and blood clots. The surgical site is kept clean and dry, and the patient is educated on proper wound care and signs of infection.

During the postoperative course, the patient experiences mild incisional pain, which is effectively managed with oral analgesics. He is discharged home on postoperative day two with appropriate pain medications and wound care instructions. The surgical team schedules a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess wound healing and monitor for any signs of recurrence or complications.

The patient's postoperative course is otherwise uneventful, with no significant complications noted. He reports a gradual improvement in pain and function over the next few weeks. At the follow-up appointment, the wound is healing well, with no signs of infection or hernia recurrence. The patient is advised to continue his antihypertensive medications and metformin, with regular follow-up visits to his primary care physician to monitor his chronic conditions.

In summary, the 45-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes underwent a successful hernia repair surgery. He had an uneventful postoperative course with no complications noted. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day two and will continue to follow up with his primary care physician for the management of his chronic conditions.
