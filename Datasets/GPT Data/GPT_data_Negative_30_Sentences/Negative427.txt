The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. 

He has a 10-year history of uncontrolled hypertension, currently managed with a combination of medications. The patient also has a 5-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, with average glucose levels ranging from 180 to 220 mg/dL. He is compliant with his oral hypoglycemic medications but struggles with lifestyle modifications. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of obesity and has a body mass index (BMI) of 32. His weight has remained stable over the past year. He reports occasional back pain and occasional shortness of breath with exertion. 

The patient had a pre-operative evaluation and was found to have well-controlled blood pressure and stable glycemic control. His baseline renal function is within normal limits, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 ml/min/1.73m². No signs of acute renal failure were noted. 

He underwent surgery without any complications, and there were no difficulties with anesthesia induction or maintenance. The surgical procedure went smoothly and was completed within the expected time frame. 

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where he remained stable. Vital signs were monitored regularly, and pain control was achieved with a combination of oral analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 

The patient's wound was inspected and found to have appropriate healing with no signs of infection. He was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated and received instructions on deep breathing exercises and coughing to prevent respiratory complications.

On the second postoperative day, the patient had a transient fever, peaking at 101.2°F. Blood cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated empirically. No growth was noted in the cultures, and the fever resolved spontaneously. The antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient remained afebrile thereafter.

During his hospital stay, the patient's glycemic control was closely monitored. His blood glucose remained within acceptable limits, with an average range of 120 to 160 mg/dL. No episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia were noted.

The patient was encouraged to follow a well-balanced diet and to increase his physical activity postoperatively. He received counseling on lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, smoking cessation, and regular exercise.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed a mild wound infection, characterized by erythema, pain, and purulent discharge. Wound cultures were obtained, and appropriate antibiotics were initiated. The infection responded well to treatment, and the wound healed without further complications.

The patient was discharged home on the sixth postoperative day with oral antibiotics for the wound infection. He was referred to the primary care physician for further management of his chronic medical conditions. 

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the wound was healing well, with no signs of infection. The patient reported resolution of his back pain and improved tolerance to physical activity. His blood pressure remained controlled, and his glycemic control showed slight improvement.

In conclusion, the patient had a successful hernia repair surgery without any complications related to acute renal failure. He experienced a transient fever, which resolved spontaneously, and a mild wound infection, which responded well to treatment. The postoperative course was otherwise uneventful, and the patient's chronic medical conditions were managed appropriately.
