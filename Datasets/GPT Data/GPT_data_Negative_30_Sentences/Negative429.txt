The patient is a 45-year-old male who underwent surgery for a herniated disc. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. The patient takes medications for these conditions, including metoprolol, metformin, and insulin. He had a preoperative evaluation that included a physical examination, blood work, and an electrocardiogram, which revealed no major abnormalities.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and underwent a successful procedure to repair the herniated disc. The surgery lasted approximately two hours, and there were no intraoperative complications. The patient was closely monitored during the procedure, and vital signs remained stable throughout.

In terms of the postoperative course, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. He was closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications, including wound infection, bleeding, or respiratory distress. The patient received appropriate pain management with opioid analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The patient was encouraged to start mobilizing and performing deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and thromboembolism. Physical therapy was also initiated to aid in rehabilitation and prevent muscle stiffness or weakness.

Although the patient's recovery initially progressed well, he developed a surgical site infection one week after the procedure. The infection was localized and treated with oral antibiotics. The wound was analyzed for microbial cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy was initiated based on sensitivities.

The patient responded well to treatment, and the infection resolved within two weeks. He continued to receive close monitoring for any signs of recurrent infection or abscess formation. Daily wound care was performed, and the patient was educated on proper hygiene practices to prevent future infections.

In terms of complications, besides the surgical site infection, the patient did not experience any other major postoperative issues. He had satisfactory pain control with the prescribed analgesics, and his vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period.

During the postoperative follow-up visits, the patient was assessed for long-term complications, such as persistent pain, nerve damage, or recurrence of the herniated disc. Neurological examinations were performed, and imaging studies, including MRI, were obtained to evaluate the surgical outcome.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful, with the surgical site infection being the only significant complication encountered. The patient continued to follow up with his primary care physician to manage his chronic medical conditions and ensure proper wound healing.
