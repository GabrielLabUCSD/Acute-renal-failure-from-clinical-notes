The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been compliant with his medications, taking lisinopril for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for cholesterol management, and metformin for diabetes.

He has a history of smoking but quit ten years ago. The patient does not consume alcohol and denies any illicit drug use. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination revealed a hernia that was reducible. Laboratory tests showed a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c of 7%. His lipid profile indicated LDL cholesterol levels of 130 mg/dL and HDL cholesterol levels of 40 mg/dL.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and showed normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities. A chest X-ray was unremarkable, and pulmonary function tests indicated normal lung function. The patient was given preoperative instructions and consented for surgery.

Following the hernia repair surgery, the patient's postoperative period was uneventful. He was carefully monitored for any signs of infection, bleeding, or complications. The surgical wound was clean and showed no signs of erythema, discharge, or dehiscence. The patient's pain was well-controlled with oral analgesics, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues.

A postoperative follow-up appointment was scheduled for the patient after two weeks. During the follow-up visit, the surgical wound had completely healed with no signs of infection. The patient reported minimal pain and no limitations in his daily activities. He was advised on wound care and gradual resumption of physical activities, with no heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for at least four weeks.

At this time, his blood pressure was in the normal range at 120/80 mmHg, and his fasting blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL, indicating improved glycemic control. His lipid profile showed a reduction in LDL cholesterol to 100 mg/dL and an increase in HDL cholesterol to 50 mg/dL, indicating the effectiveness of his medication regimen.

The patient did not experience any complications during his postoperative course, such as wound infection, hematoma formation, or incisional hernia. There were no signs of cardiovascular events, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or abnormal ECG findings. Furthermore, there were no postoperative complications related to his diabetes, such as poor glycemic control or delayed wound healing.

In summary, the patient with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent successful hernia repair surgery without any postoperative complications. His recovery was unremarkable, and his blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid profile improved after the surgery. The patient's commitment to lifestyle modifications and medication adherence played a crucial role in his favorable postoperative course.
