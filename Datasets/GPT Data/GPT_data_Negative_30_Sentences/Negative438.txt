The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with chronic back pain. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been experiencing severe lower back pain for the past two years and has failed conservative management including physical therapy and medications. He is seeking surgical intervention to improve his quality of life.

Upon evaluation, the patient's physical examination revealed tenderness over the lumbar spine with limited range of motion. Radiographic imaging, including X-rays and MRI, showed degenerative disc disease with disc herniation at the L4-L5 level. As a result, the patient was diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation.

Given the patient's significant symptoms and failure of conservative management, the surgical option of a discectomy was discussed. The procedure involves removing the herniated portion of the intervertebral disc to relieve nerve compression. The patient understood the risks and benefits of the surgery and provided informed consent.

Before surgery, the patient underwent routine preoperative evaluations, including blood tests, ECG, and chest X-ray. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels were controlled within acceptable limits. The patient's medications, including antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemics, and statins, were continued during the perioperative period. He was counseled regarding fasting requirements and given instructions for bowel preparation.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated it well. Intraoperatively, a standard discectomy procedure was carried out, and the herniated disc material was successfully removed. There were no immediate complications during the procedure, and the estimated blood loss was minimal.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring and recovery. He was able to ambulate with assistance shortly after awakening from anesthesia. Pain control was achieved through a multimodal approach, including the use of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Rehabilitation services were initiated the day after surgery to promote early mobilization and strengthening exercises.

The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful. He did not develop any wound infections or deep vein thrombosis. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable, and he did not experience any perioperative cardiac events. The patient's pain gradually improved, and he was able to wean off opioid medications within a week.

On the third postoperative day, the patient complained of constipation, which was managed conservatively with stool softeners and adequate hydration. He resumed regular bowel movements shortly after intervention. The patient showed good progress during physical therapy sessions, demonstrating improved range of motion and reduced pain.

In the weeks following surgery, the patient was scheduled for periodic follow-up visits. He continued his home exercises as directed, with gradual increase in intensity. The patient reported a significant reduction in his back pain and improvement in his overall quality of life.

In conclusion, the 55-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia underwent a successful discectomy for lumbar disc herniation. The surgery was uneventful, without immediate complications. The patient had a smooth postoperative course, achieving pain control and early mobilization. He experienced a transient episode of constipation but responded well to conservative management. Overall, the patient showed significant improvement in his back pain and quality of life following surgery.
