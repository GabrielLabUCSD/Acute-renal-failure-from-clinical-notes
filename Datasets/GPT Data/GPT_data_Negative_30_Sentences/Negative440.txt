The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a significant medical history leading up to his upcoming surgery. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery five years ago and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. He also has a history of peripheral artery disease and has undergone angioplasty in the past.

Additionally, the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a former smoker. Pulmonary function tests in the past revealed moderate airflow limitation. He occasionally uses an albuterol inhaler for symptomatic relief. The patient has experienced episodes of pneumonia in the past, which were successfully treated with antibiotics.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy performed in his childhood and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. He had an uneventful recovery in both instances. A recent abdominal CT scan revealed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5 centimeters. Due to concerns for rupture, the decision was made to proceed with elective endovascular repair of the aneurysm.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent an extensive workup, including cardiac stress testing, which revealed mild myocardial ischemia, for which his antianginal medications were optimized. He also underwent a complete blood count, which showed a mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL. Iron studies were ordered, and the patient was found to have iron deficiency anemia. He was started on oral iron supplements to correct the deficiency.

The patient had a preoperative consultation with the anesthesiologist, who reviewed the patient's medical history and planned anesthetic management. During the discussion, the patient mentioned some concerns about postoperative pain management and a history of adverse reactions to opioids. The anesthesiologist reassured the patient that a multimodal analgesic approach would be used, including non-opioid medications and regional anesthesia techniques.

The patient underwent the elective endovascular repair procedure under general anesthesia. The surgery was uneventful. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure, and blood loss was minimal. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for close monitoring.

In the SICU, the patient received analgesic medications, including non-opioids such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, along with intermittent doses of opioids as needed. His pain was adequately controlled, and he did not report any adverse reactions to the medications. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course was smooth, and he did not experience any significant complications. He was successfully weaned off the ventilator within a few hours after the surgery, and his respiratory function remained stable. The patient's incision site was monitored for signs of infection, but no redness, swelling, or discharge was observed.

The patient's laboratory parameters were closely monitored postoperatively. His hemoglobin level remained stable, with no evidence of ongoing bleeding or anemia. Additionally, his renal function was within normal limits, and he did not develop acute renal failure. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet and his preoperative medications, which were resumed shortly after the surgery.

Physical therapy was initiated to assist the patient in regaining mobility and strength. The patient's vital signs and oxygen saturation were regularly monitored, and he was gradually weaned off supplemental oxygen. He showed good progress in ambulation and was able to achieve the required milestones for discharge from the hospital.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 in a stable condition. He was provided with detailed postoperative instructions, including wound care and medication management. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further monitoring and management of his chronic medical conditions.

To summarize, a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, peripheral artery disease, and COPD underwent elective endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His surgery and postoperative course were uneventful, with adequate pain control and no significant complications. The patient's laboratory parameters and vital signs remained stable, and he was discharged home in a stable condition.
