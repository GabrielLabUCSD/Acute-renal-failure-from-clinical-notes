The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years and takes oral hypoglycemic agents to manage his diabetes.

He presents to the hospital for a planned surgery to remove a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. The patient has been experiencing severe back pain and radiating leg pain for the past six months, which has not improved with conservative management.

His preoperative labs show well-controlled blood glucose levels with a HbA1c of 6.3%. His kidney function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. Chest X-ray and EKG are also normal, indicating good cardiac and pulmonary function.

During the surgery, general anesthesia is administered without any complications. The procedure involves a posterior approach for discectomy and decompression of the affected nerve root.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with no excessive bleeding or infection at the surgical site. He is able to walk with minimal assistance on the first postoperative day and reports a significant reduction in his back and leg pain.

He is started on a multimodal pain management regimen, including opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and gabapentinoids, to help control his postoperative pain. The patient also receives regular physical therapy to aid in his recovery.

Throughout his hospital stay, his blood glucose levels are closely monitored, and his oral hypoglycemic agents are adjusted accordingly to maintain optimal glycemic control.

The patient is discharged home on the third postoperative day with clear instructions for wound care and pain management. He is advised to gradually increase his activity level and avoid heavy lifting for the next few weeks to ensure proper healing.

At his six-week follow-up visit, the patient reports continued improvement in his back and leg pain. He has transitioned from opioids to NSAIDs for pain relief and has successfully weaned off gabapentinoids. No complications, such as wound infection or persistent neurological deficits, are noted.

The patient is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and expresses gratitude for the improvement in his quality of life. He continues his regular follow-up visits with his primary care physician to monitor his hypertension and diabetes, both of which remain well-controlled.

In summary, the patient with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 underwent a successful surgery for herniated disc removal. His postoperative course was unremarkable, experiencing no complications. His pain was effectively managed, and he achieved significant pain relief. The patient's glycemic control was closely monitored during his hospital stay, and he was discharged home with appropriate instructions for wound care and further recovery. At the six-week follow-up, he demonstrated continued improvement and no signs of complications.
