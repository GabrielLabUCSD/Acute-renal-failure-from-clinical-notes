The patient is a 52-year-old male who has a significant medical history. He has a past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The patient is a smoker and has a 15 pack-year smoking history. He has had a previous myocardial infarction two years ago for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis that has hindered his mobility and quality of life. He has undergone conservative management including physical therapy and analgesics, but the symptoms have progressively worsened.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation to assess his surgical risk. He had an electrocardiogram, which showed no acute changes, and a transthoracic echocardiogram, which demonstrated normal left ventricular function and no valvular abnormalities. His lipid panel showed well-controlled dyslipidemia, and his fasting blood glucose levels were within the target range with current diabetic medications.

The patient was started on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy one week prior to surgery to prevent stent thrombosis. He was advised to discontinue his nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and was prescribed low-dose opioids for pain control during the perioperative period.

The surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and general anesthesia. The surgical team reported good visualization and correction of the knee deformity. The procedure lasted approximately three hours, and the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).

In the PACU, the patient was monitored closely, and his vital signs remained stable. He was started on oral pain medications and encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia. The patient was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet and passed urine without any difficulty.

The patient was transferred to the orthopedic ward on the first postoperative day. He continued to receive appropriate pain control and physical therapy for early mobilization. The surgical wound was inspected regularly and showed signs of healing without any signs of infection or dehiscence.

Throughout the postoperative course, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and there were no concerning laboratory abnormalities. He was monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but none were detected. The patient experienced no signs of excessive pain, wound complications, or signs of infection.

On the third postoperative day, the patient was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist using a walker. He was discharged home with appropriate postoperative instructions, including wound care, pain management, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments. The patient was advised to continue with his smoking cessation efforts and to follow up with his primary care physician for ongoing management of his chronic medical conditions.

In summary, this 52-year-old male underwent an elective total knee replacement for severe osteoarthritis. The surgery was performed without intraoperative complications, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He experienced no significant complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient was discharged home with appropriate instructions and was recommended to continue with his medical management.
