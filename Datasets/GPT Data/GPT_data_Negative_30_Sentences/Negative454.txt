Patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery five years ago.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with a combination of antihypertensive medications, including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. His blood pressure readings have been consistently within the normal range over the past year.

Regarding diabetes, the patient is on metformin and gliclazide for glycemic control. His HbA1c levels have been stable at around 7%. He monitors his blood glucose regularly and reports no episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

Hyperlipidemia is managed with atorvastatin, and the patient's lipid profile has shown significant improvement. His LDL cholesterol levels are within the target range, which has reduced his risk of cardiovascular events.

In addition to these chronic conditions, the patient has a history of osteoarthritis in both knees, causing significant joint pain and limitation of mobility. He has been managing the symptoms with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy.

The patient is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol consumption. He denies any significant allergies to medications or food.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent routine investigations including blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest X-ray. All results were within the normal range, indicating good overall health and suitability for surgery.

The surgical procedure planned for the patient is a total knee replacement. This decision was made due to the significant symptoms caused by his osteoarthritis, which have not improved with conservative management.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely for pain, infection, and complications related to surgery. He received intravenous morphine for pain control immediately after the procedure and transitioned to oral analgesics within 24 hours. The patient reported adequate pain relief and was able to mobilize with the assistance of physical therapy.

To prevent complications, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery. There were no signs of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence, and the incision site healed well.

The patient's postoperative course was favorable, and he showed improvement in knee range of motion and reduction in pain. Physical therapy played a crucial role in his recovery, and he was compliant with the recommended exercises and stretching routines.

To prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the patient received prophylactic anticoagulation therapy, including low molecular weight heparin and compression stockings. No thromboembolic events were reported during the postoperative period.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth day after surgery. He was provided with post-discharge instructions, including wound care, pain management, exercises, and follow-up appointments.

During follow-up visits, the patient reported continued improvement in pain and functional abilities. He adhered to the prescribed physical therapy plan and gradually regained his mobility.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any major postoperative issues. There were no signs of wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Additionally, there were no cardiac events or complications related to diabetes control.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he achieved his desired outcome of improved knee function and reduced pain. He expressed satisfaction with the surgery and the overall care received.
