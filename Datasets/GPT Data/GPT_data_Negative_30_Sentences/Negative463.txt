The patient is a 50-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on medications including lisinopril for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for cholesterol management, and metformin for diabetes.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed three years ago for symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient had a smooth recovery without any postoperative complications.

He has a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Due to this familial risk, the patient underwent a stress test last year, which revealed no significant abnormalities.

His preoperative workup involved routine laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation studies, and a urinalysis. All results were within normal limits except for a slightly elevated fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, consistent with his known diabetes.

The patient's vital signs were stable during his preoperative assessment, with blood pressure ranging around 130/80 mmHg, heart rate averaging 75 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Regarding allergies, the patient denied any known drug allergies or adverse reactions to anesthesia in the past. He also provided a thorough medication history, and there were no concerns or contraindications related to his preoperative medications.

General physical examination showed a well-nourished individual with no signs of acute distress. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and abdominal examination revealed a reducible inguinal hernia in the right inguinal region.

In terms of social history, the patient is a non-smoker and denies any significant alcohol or drug use. He is married, lives with his spouse, and has a supportive family.

The patient was counseled about the surgery, including the risks and benefits, potential complications, and the expected postoperative course. He expressed understanding and consented to the procedure.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived in the preoperative holding area where appropriate measures were taken to ensure his safety and compliance with the surgical protocol. His diabetes was managed by adjusting the timing and dosage of his preoperative medications to maintain glycemic control.

The surgical procedure, an open hernia repair with mesh placement, was performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia, and there were no significant hemodynamic or respiratory changes reported during surgery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery area where he was closely monitored for pain control, vital signs, and any signs of surgical site infection. He received appropriate postoperative analgesia through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with adequate pain control achieved within the first 24 hours post-surgery. He was able to tolerate a regular diet without nausea or vomiting, and his bowel function returned to normal in the early postoperative period.

The surgical team closely followed the patient's wound healing progression and monitored for any signs of infection, such as erythema, warmth, or purulent drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered perioperatively to minimize the risk of infection.

The patient was ambulated on the first postoperative day, and he demonstrated good mobility without assistance. Nursing staff reinforced deep breathing exercises and provided instructions on mobilization and wound care.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of wound complications, surgical site infection, or deep vein thrombosis. He was discharged home on postoperative day two with appropriate pain management instructions and a follow-up appointment scheduled in the surgical clinic.

During the postoperative period, the patient complied with all prescribed medications and demonstrated good adherence to self-care instructions. The follow-up visit confirmed adequate wound healing, and the patient reported minimal pain at the incision site.

Overall, the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course without any major complications. His surgical repair was successful, and he achieved a full recovery within the expected timeframe.
