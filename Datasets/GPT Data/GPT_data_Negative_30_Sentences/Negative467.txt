The patient is a 45-year-old male with a significant medical history as he prepares for surgery. He has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. The patient also has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a history of hyperlipidemia as well, which is controlled with a statin medication. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Additionally, the patient has a history of smoking for the past 10 years, but has recently quit 6 months ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use. The patient has a sedentary lifestyle and does not partake in regular exercise or physical activity.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has no previous surgeries. However, he did have a cholecystectomy three years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient had a smooth recovery postoperatively. He did not experience any complications.

The patient's family history is significant for ischemic heart disease, with his father experiencing a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. His mother has a history of hypertension and his brother has type 2 diabetes.

During preoperative evaluation, laboratory results revealed normal complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and liver function tests. Renal function tests indicated mild chronic kidney disease stage 2, with a mildly elevated serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. The patient had a normal chest X-ray and electrocardiogram, ruling out any significant cardiac or pulmonary issues.

The patient was advised to continue taking his antihypertensive medication preoperatively, while holding his oral hypoglycemic agent the morning of surgery. He was instructed to consume a light meal the night before surgery and to avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight.

Following surgery, the patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He experienced some mild pain at the surgical site, which was managed with analgesics. The patient was ambulating well and had good urine output. He was started on a clear liquid diet on the day of surgery and then advanced to a regular diet the following day.

The patient's vital signs remained stable, with blood pressure ranging from 120/80 to 130/90 mmHg. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored and remained within normal limits. No signs of infection or wound complications were noted during postoperative assessments.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications like infections, bleeding, or excessive pain. However, in the following week, he reported a decrease in urine output and increased fatigue. A urine analysis revealed proteinuria and hematuria. Subsequent investigations revealed worsening renal function, with a serum creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL and a decline in glomerular filtration rate.

Renal ultrasound and CT scan were performed, which showed bilateral hydronephrosis. The patient was diagnosed with obstructive uropathy secondary to ureteral stricture formation, likely due to intraoperative manipulation during surgery. He was referred to a urologist for further evaluation and management.

Overall, while the patient initially had an uneventful postoperative course, he later developed a complication related to his kidneys. The ureteral stricture resulted in obstructive uropathy, leading to bilateral hydronephrosis and a decline in renal function. This complication required further intervention by a urologist to manage.
