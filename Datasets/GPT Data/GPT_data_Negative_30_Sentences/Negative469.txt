The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] who is planning to undergo surgery. Their medical history is significant for [list of medical conditions]. They have a history of [list of surgeries or procedures]. The patient's medications include [list of medications], which will need to be continued or adjusted during the perioperative period. Additionally, they have allergies to [list of allergies], which should be communicated to the surgical team.

In terms of their surgical history, the patient has previously had [list of previous surgeries]. They have experienced [list of postoperative complications] in the past, but acute renal failure has not been documented. However, some of these complications might require particular attention during the current surgery to avoid recurrence.

The preoperative evaluation revealed [list of pertinent findings from physical examination and diagnostic tests]. Of note, their baseline renal function is [normal/impaired] with a creatinine level of [value] and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of [value]. This baseline renal function should be kept in mind during the perioperative period and may guide fluid management and medication choices to prevent any further decline.

The patient's surgery is scheduled for [date], and the surgical procedure planned is [surgery type]. Preoperative counseling about the surgery, including expected benefits, potential risks, and complications, has been provided. The patient understands the procedure and consents to its performance.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient will be monitored closely in the recovery area. Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, will be monitored regularly. Pain management will be optimized to ensure the patient's comfort and early mobilization. The surgical incision site will be observed for signs of infection or delayed wound healing.

The patient's postoperative care will involve close monitoring of their renal function. Serial measurements of serum creatinine and urine output will be obtained to assess renal function and identify any potential complications like acute renal injury. Adequate hydration will be maintained, balancing fluid intake and output to support renal perfusion and prevent dehydration or overhydration.

To prevent postsurgical complications, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis measures will be implemented, including early ambulation, sequential compression devices, and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, if indicated. Proper respiratory care, including incentive spirometry and early mobilization, will also be initiated to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia.

The patient's transition from the hospital to home will be well-coordinated. Appropriate discharge planning, including medication reconciliation, provision of written and verbal instructions about wound care, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments, will be ensured. Home health care services or outpatient rehabilitation may be recommended based on the patient's individual needs and recovery progress.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful overall, and they did not experience any acute renal failure. Their vital signs remained stable, and they were able to tolerate oral intake without any complications. The surgical incision is healing well without signs of infection. The patient reported minimal pain and was able to mobilize with assistance on the day of surgery. They followed up with the surgical team for a postoperative visit, during which their wound was inspected, and any remaining concerns were addressed.

In summary, the patient with a history of [medical conditions] is scheduled to undergo [surgery type]. Their preoperative evaluation revealed [relevant findings]. The surgical procedure was performed on [date], and the patient's perioperative care involved close monitoring of renal function, pain management, and measures to prevent complications. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and they did not experience any complications, including acute renal failure. They will continue to be monitored during the recovery period to ensure optimal healing and a successful outcome.
