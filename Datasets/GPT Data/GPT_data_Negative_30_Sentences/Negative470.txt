The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a pertinent medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been taking anti-hypertensive medications for the past five years to control his blood pressure, including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. His diabetes was diagnosed ten years ago and is managed with metformin and regular exercise.

The patient presents today with a chief complaint of persistent knee pain that has not improved with conservative treatment. He has tried physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections without substantial relief. After a thorough evaluation, it is determined that he would benefit from knee arthroscopy surgery.

On physical examination, the patient demonstrates tenderness and swelling around the affected knee joint. Range of motion is limited, and crepitus can be heard with movement. X-rays confirm osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing and the presence of osteophytes. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count and coagulation studies, are within normal limits.

In anticipation of surgery, the patient has been instructed to stop taking aspirin or any other antiplatelet medications for at least one week. His blood glucose levels have been stable with an HbA1c of 6.7%. Preoperative chest X-ray and electrocardiogram are performed, both indicating no significant abnormalities.

The patient is scheduled for knee arthroscopy under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the surgeon identifies and removes loose bodies and smoothens the articular surfaces. The procedure goes smoothly, and the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient receives adequate pain management through a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics. Physiotherapy is initiated to promote early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is closely monitored for any signs of infection or excessive bleeding.

The patient is advised to remain non-weight bearing on the affected knee for the next six weeks to allow adequate healing. Home healthcare services are arranged for wound care, physical therapy, and medication management. He is discharged home two days after the surgery with clear instructions for activity modifications and follow-up appointments.

During the postoperative course, the patient experiences the anticipated postoperative pain and swelling, which gradually improves with time. He is compliant with his medications, including his antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs. No signs of wound infection or delayed healing are noted during the follow-up visits.

The patient diligently attends all the prescribed physical therapy sessions and demonstrates gradual improvement in knee range of motion and strength. At the six-week mark, he is cleared to start partial weight-bearing exercises and gradually progresses towards full weight-bearing.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course has been uneventful, and he has had no complications. His hypertension and diabetes are well-controlled, further minimizing the risk of perioperative adverse events. The patient is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery, reporting significant reduction in knee pain and improved functional ability.
