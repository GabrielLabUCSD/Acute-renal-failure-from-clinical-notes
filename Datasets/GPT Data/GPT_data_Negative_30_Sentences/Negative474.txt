The patient is a 55-year-old male, Mr. Smith, who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are well-controlled with medications. Mr. Smith has been on lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin for several years.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, Mr. Smith has a history of smoking for 20 years but recently quit smoking 6 months ago. He does not have any known drug allergies. His physical examination is unremarkable except for the hernia.

Mr. Smith's preoperative laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and coagulation profile, are within normal limits. His chest x-ray reveals clear lung fields, and an electrocardiogram shows a regular sinus rhythm.

He is classified as an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class II. Preoperative education has been provided to Mr. Smith regarding the surgery, including anesthesia risks, wound care, and expected postoperative recovery.

On the day of surgery, Mr. Smith is brought to the operating room where general anesthesia is induced without any complications. The surgical procedure to repair the hernia is performed laparoscopically, and the surgeon notes no intraoperative complications.

Postoperatively, Mr. Smith is monitored in the recovery room for a few hours until he is stable. He is then transferred to the surgical ward for further observation and pain management. Non-opioid analgesics are initially used for pain control, and Mr. Smith rates his pain as mild to moderate.

His postoperative course is uneventful, with no signs of wound infection or dehiscence. He has normal bowel function, and there is no evidence of postoperative paralytic ileus. Mr. Smith's vital signs remain stable, and he is able to ambulate without assistance.

On the second postoperative day, Mr. Smith's pain decreases further, and he is transitioned to oral analgesics as needed. His incisions are healing well, showing no signs of erythema or drainage. The surgical team continues to monitor his vital signs and provide appropriate wound care.

During his hospital stay, Mr. Smith's blood glucose levels are closely monitored, and his diabetes medications are adjusted accordingly. He maintains good glycemic control without any episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

Mr. Smith is discharged home on the third postoperative day with instructions for wound care, activity restrictions, and precautions regarding lifting heavy objects. He is advised to follow up with his primary care physician in one week for a postoperative check-up.

In his follow-up visit, Mr. Smith reports feeling well and having minimal pain at his incision sites. His wounds are healing nicely without any signs of infection, and his blood pressure and blood glucose levels are well-controlled. His primary care physician is pleased with his progress.

In summary, Mr. Smith, a 55-year-old male, underwent laparoscopic hernia repair surgery. His preoperative course and surgical procedure were uneventful. Postoperatively, he had a smooth recovery without complications, including wound infection, dehiscence, or ileus. His pain was well-controlled, and his chronic medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, were managed appropriately. He was discharged home on the third postoperative day and followed up with his primary care physician, who noted a satisfactory postoperative course.
