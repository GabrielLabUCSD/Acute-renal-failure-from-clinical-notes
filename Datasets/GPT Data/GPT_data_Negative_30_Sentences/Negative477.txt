The patient is a previously healthy 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. His past medical history is unremarkable, and he has no known allergies. He has been taking over-the-counter pain medication as needed for occasional headaches.

During the preoperative assessment, it was noted that the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate. His lung sounds were clear, and his abdomen was soft and non-tender. Laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, were within normal limits. His renal function was intact, with a serum creatinine level of 0.87 mg/dL.

The patient was asked to stop taking any medications that could increase the risk of bleeding, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prior to surgery. He was instructed to fast for at least 6 hours before the procedure and was provided with detailed instructions regarding preoperative preparations.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital in good spirits. He was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was administered. The surgical team successfully repaired the inguinal hernia using a tension-free mesh technique. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient tolerated the surgery well.

Following surgery, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery area for a few hours. He was given pain medication to manage postoperative discomfort, and his vital signs remained stable. He was able to tolerate oral fluids without any issues and was gradually started on a regular diet.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient's pain continued to improve, and his mobility increased. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia. The surgical site was inspected regularly for signs of infection, and appropriate dressing changes were performed.

The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated. He did not experience any significant bleeding or wound complications. He followed all the postoperative instructions, including regular wound care and the avoidance of heavy lifting or strenuous activities. He reported minimal pain and was able to return to his regular activities within a week.

Routine follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and evaluate the surgical site. During these visits, the wound was inspected for signs of healing, and the patient's overall recovery was assessed. The patient continued to do well, with no signs of infection or other complications.

In summary, the patient, a 45-year-old male, underwent an uneventful inguinal hernia repair surgery. His preoperative assessment was normal, and he had no significant medical history or allergies. The surgery was successful, and the patient had a smooth postoperative course without any complications. He followed all postoperative instructions and achieved a satisfactory recovery.
