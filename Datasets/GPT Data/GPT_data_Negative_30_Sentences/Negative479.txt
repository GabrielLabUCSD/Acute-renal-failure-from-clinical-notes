The patient is a 45-year-old female who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. She is planning to undergo surgery for gallbladder removal due to recurrent episodes of biliary colic.
Her hypertension is well-controlled with medications, and her diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. However, her current body mass index (BMI) of 35 indicates morbid obesity.
She has a history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and mild hepatomegaly but has not had any significant liver dysfunction. Her liver function tests are within the normal range.
The patient has been on a low-fat diet to manage her gallbladder symptoms and has experienced temporary relief. However, surgical intervention is warranted to prevent further complications.
She does not have a known history of bleeding disorders or abnormal clotting parameters. Thus, her risk of excessive bleeding during surgery is considered low.
The patient had a preoperative assessment by the anesthesiologist and it was noted that her airway is predicted to be difficult to intubate due to her obesity. A plan was formulated for intubation using a video laryngoscope.
She was advised to stop taking any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anticoagulant medications prior to the surgery to minimize bleeding risk.
The patient has no history of allergies to medications or previous adverse reactions to anesthesia. Her vital signs are stable, with blood pressure consistently around 130/80 mmHg and heart rate approximately 70 beats per minute.
Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and coagulation profile were within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated fasting blood glucose level.
The patient was consented for surgery, and the surgical team discussed the potential risks and benefits of the procedure, including the risk of infection, bleeding, bile duct injury, or recurrence of symptoms.
On the day of surgery, the patient was fasted and received prophylactic antibiotics. An epidural catheter was placed preoperatively for postoperative pain management.
During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and was intubated using a video laryngoscope without any difficulties. Her intraoperative course was uneventful, and the gallbladder was successfully removed laparoscopically.
The postoperative course was relatively smooth, with the patient recovering well in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). She was monitored closely for pain control, wound healing, and gastrointestinal function.
She was started on oral intake gradually, initially receiving clear liquids and advancing to a regular diet as tolerated. She did not report any postoperative nausea or vomiting.
The patient's pain was managed using a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. She required minimal opioid medications and was transitioned to non-opioid pain management on the first day after surgery.
Her vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period, and she did not develop any signs of infection such as fever, redness, or pus discharge from the surgical site.
The patient was ambulating well and was encouraged to move around to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis. She received prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin injections.
There were no significant postoperative laboratory abnormalities, and her renal function remained stable throughout her hospital stay. She did not develop acute renal failure.
On the third postoperative day, the patient was evaluated by the surgeon and deemed fit for discharge. She was educated about wound care, signs of potential complications, and the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
The patient was discharged home on the fourth postoperative day after having a discussion with the surgeon regarding her successful surgery. She was provided with a prescription for oral pain medications, as needed.
During the follow-up visit after two weeks, the patient reported minimal pain and no signs of wound infection. Her recovery was uneventful, and she was satisfied with the surgical outcome.
Overall, the patient's surgery for gallbladder removal went smoothly, with no complications noted in her postoperative course.
