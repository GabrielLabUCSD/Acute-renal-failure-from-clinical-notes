The patient is a 45-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is scheduled to undergo surgery for a non-healing wound on her foot, which has been present for the past three months. The patient has tried various conservative measures, but the wound has not improved. She has a history of poor wound healing in the past, which required surgical intervention. She is currently on antihypertensive medications and oral hypoglycemic agents for her chronic conditions.

During the preoperative assessment, it was noted that the patient had a baseline hemoglobin A1c of 7.5%, indicating good glycemic control. She has been compliant with her medications and regularly checks her blood sugar levels at home. The patient's blood pressure readings have also been within target range, and she has not experienced any recent episodes of orthostatic hypotension.

The patient's surgical team has recommended a comprehensive preoperative assessment to ensure optimal management of her chronic conditions during the perioperative period. This includes obtaining an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and basic laboratory tests. The patient's cardiac evaluation revealed no significant abnormalities, and her chest X-ray was unremarkable.

Upon reviewing her medical history, it was noted that the patient has had previous surgical procedures under general anesthesia without any complications. She tolerated anesthesia well and had no known allergies to any medications. The patient does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs, which reduces perioperative risks.

The surgical team has decided to perform the surgery under general anesthesia in a controlled environment. The patient was educated on the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery. The potential risks discussed included infection, bleeding, poor wound healing, and the need for further surgical interventions. The patient acknowledged and understood these potential complications.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored for any signs of infection, such as fever, redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical wound. She will receive prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. DVT prophylaxis will also be implemented to prevent deep vein thrombosis, as the patient will have limited mobility post-surgery.

The surgical wound will be assessed regularly for signs of healing, and appropriate dressing changes will be performed as necessary. The patient will follow up with a wound care specialist for close monitoring and management of her non-healing wound. She will be educated on proper wound care techniques and provided with a detailed plan for dressing changes and self-monitoring.

To optimize wound healing, the patient will be advised to maintain good glycemic control and ensure adequate nutrition. The surgical team will work closely with the patient's primary care physician and endocrinologist to adjust her medications as necessary and maintain her blood sugar levels within target range.

In terms of pain management, the patient will be given analgesics as needed to ensure her comfort and facilitate mobility. She will be encouraged to ambulate as tolerated and participate in physical therapy to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and muscle atrophy.

Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess the progress of wound healing and the patient's overall recovery. Any concerns or complications that arise will be addressed promptly to ensure optimal outcomes. The patient will be educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications and advised to seek immediate medical attention if any arise.

In summary, the 45-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 is scheduled for surgery due to a non-healing foot wound. She has a past medical history of poor wound healing, which required previous surgical intervention. The patient's preoperative assessment revealed good glycemic control and satisfactory blood pressure readings. She has had previous surgeries without complications and has no known allergies. The surgical team has recommended performing the surgery under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored for infection and wound healing. DVT prophylaxis and appropriate wound care techniques will be implemented. The patient will receive analgesics for pain management and participate in physical therapy to prevent complications. Regular follow-up appointments are planned to assess progress and address any potential complications. No specific complications were mentioned in the given information.
