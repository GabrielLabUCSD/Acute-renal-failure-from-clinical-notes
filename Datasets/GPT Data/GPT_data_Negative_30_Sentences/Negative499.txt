The patient, a 45-year-old male, has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35. His blood pressure is well-controlled on a combination of angiotensin receptor blocker and diuretic, and his diabetes is managed with diet and exercise.

The patient presents with symptoms of severe knee arthritis, which significantly affects his mobility and quality of life. Despite conservative measures, including physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and intra-articular steroid injections, his symptoms persist.

Given the unrelenting pain and functional impairment, the patient has decided to undergo a total knee replacement surgery. Preoperative assessments have revealed satisfactory lung and cardiac functions, making him a suitable candidate for surgery.

During the preoperative evaluation, his HbA1c was 7.2%, indicating acceptable long-term glycemic control. His lipid profile only showed a mild elevation in LDL cholesterol, managed with a statin medication.

The anesthesiologist has reviewed the patientâ€™s previous anesthesia records and did not find any concerns or complications. The patient has been instructed to discontinue his anti-hypertensive medication the night before surgery, with plans to resume it postoperatively.

On the day of surgery, his vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 76 beats per minute. After the administration of anesthesia, the patient undergoes an uneventful surgery lasting approximately two hours.

In the postoperative period, the patient is closely monitored in the recovery room. His vital signs remain stable, with a blood pressure ranging between 120/70 and 130/80 mmHg. He complains of mild-to-moderate incisional pain, which is promptly managed with patient-controlled analgesia and oral narcotic medications.

The patient is mobilized out of bed on the first postoperative day, with the assistance of a physical therapist. He is encouraged to perform range-of-motion exercises and is instructed on the importance of deep breathing and coughing to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's incision site remains clean and there are no signs of infection or wound complications. His hematocrit level, obtained on the second postoperative day, is 36%, indicating minimal blood loss during surgery.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's blood glucose levels remain within target range, and he continues his preoperative diabetic medications. There are no documentation of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episodes.

On the third postoperative day, the patient's pain is well-controlled with oral pain medications, and he demonstrates good functional improvement. Physical therapy continues, focusing on gait training and strengthening exercises.

The patient is discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day with a prescription for oral pain medications and clear instructions on wound care and activity restrictions. A follow-up appointment is scheduled to assess his progress in two weeks.

During the postoperative period, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or surgical site hematoma. His recovery is smooth and uneventful.

In the subsequent weeks, the patient adheres to his rehabilitation regimen and attends physical therapy sessions as recommended. His knee function improves steadily, enabling him to resume daily activities with minimal pain and improved mobility.

At the two-week follow-up appointment, the patient reports overall satisfaction with the surgery and its outcomes. His incision has healed well, and his knee range of motion has significantly improved compared to preoperative status.

In summary, the patient, a middle-aged male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, successfully underwent a total knee replacement surgery to manage severe knee arthritis. His perioperative course was unremarkable, and he experienced no complications during the postoperative period. The patient diligently followed the prescribed rehabilitation program and achieved satisfactory functional outcomes, leading to improved quality of life.
