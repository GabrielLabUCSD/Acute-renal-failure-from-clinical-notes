The patient is a 55-year-old female who presents with a significant medical history and is planning to undergo surgery. She has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. She has been on a stable dose of lisinopril for the past four years. Additionally, the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is managed through diet and exercise. Her blood glucose levels have been within target range for the past three years.

The patient has a known allergy to penicillin and is advised to avoid any medications or products containing penicillin. Aside from this allergy, there are no other known drug allergies reported.

She has had past surgical interventions, including a cholecystectomy performed ten years ago for symptomatic gallstones. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had an uneventful postoperative course. She has also undergone a hysterectomy for benign uterine fibroids five years ago. A microscopic examination of the removed uterus confirmed the diagnosis. Postoperatively, she experienced mild pain which was effectively managed with over-the-counter pain relievers.

In terms of her cardiovascular history, the patient had an incident of chest pain two years ago. An electrocardiogram was performed, which showed evidence of an old myocardial infarction. Subsequent coronary angiography revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, for which she underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention. She currently takes dual antiplatelet therapy comprising aspirin and clopidogrel.

The patient also has a history of osteoarthritis, primarily affecting her knees. She manages her symptoms with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed, most commonly ibuprofen.

Additionally, she has a family history of breast cancer, with her mother being diagnosed at the age of 60. The patient underwent regular mammograms, the most recent of which showed no evidence of malignancy.

Lab results show that the patient's complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests are all within normal limits. Her last hemoglobin A1c level was 6.2%, indicating good glycemic control.

As for the planned surgery, the patient is scheduled for an elective total knee replacement due to worsening knee pain and functional limitations caused by osteoarthritis. Preoperative imaging confirms severe degenerative changes in her knee joint.

During the postoperative period, the patient had an uneventful recovery. She reported manageable pain at the surgical site, which was successfully treated with a combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated early on, and the patient made gradual progress in regaining range of motion and strength in her knee.

The patient did not experience any complications postoperatively. She did, however, require a short-term course of prophylactic antibiotics due to her history of total knee replacement. The antibiotics were well-tolerated, and she completed the full course without any adverse effects.

Overall, the patient's surgical procedure was successful, and she demonstrated a satisfactory postoperative course with no acute complications.
