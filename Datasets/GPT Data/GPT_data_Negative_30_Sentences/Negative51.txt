The patient is a 60-year-old female who has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is planning to have elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. 

Her hypertension is well-controlled with medications, and her blood pressure readings have been within the normal range during her recent visits. She takes lisinopril daily to manage her blood pressure.

She also takes atorvastatin to control her hyperlipidemia, and recent lipid panels have shown improvement in her cholesterol levels.

Her diabetes is managed with metformin, and her blood glucose levels have been stable within the target range. She has been monitoring her blood sugar regularly and has not reported any issues.

Aside from her chronic conditions, the patient reports occasional knee pain, stiffness, and difficulty walking. She has tried conservative treatments such as physical therapy and pain medications but has not found significant relief.

She has undergone preoperative evaluations, including blood tests, chest X-ray, and an EKG, which have all shown no abnormalities. Her renal function is normal, with no signs of acute renal failure.

The patient has provided informed consent for the surgery and has been thoroughly educated about the procedure, expected outcomes, and potential complications.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and the total knee replacement was successfully performed without any intraoperative complications.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room and received appropriate pain management. She was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient was transferred to the surgical ward, where she continued to receive pain medication and physical therapy. Her vital signs remained stable, and she did not experience any immediate postoperative complications.

Over the next few days, the patient showed gradual improvement in her pain levels and mobility. Physical therapy sessions were conducted to aid her in regaining strength and range of motion in her knee.

The patient's incision site was well-healed, with no signs of infection or wound complications. She was taught proper wound care techniques and encouraged to keep the area clean and dry.

The patient was discharged home after five days in the hospital. She was given a prescription for oral pain medication and was advised to continue physical therapy on an outpatient basis.

During her post-discharge follow-up visits, the patient's wound continued to heal well, and her pain levels decreased further. She reported improvement in her ability to perform daily activities such as walking and stair climbing.

No complications, such as surgical site infection or wound dehiscence, were observed during her follow-up appointments.

The patient continued her regular medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes as before surgery. Her blood pressure remained within target ranges, and her blood glucose levels were stable.

She was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to optimize her overall health and aid in the recovery process.

At the six-week postoperative mark, the patient reported significant improvement in her knee pain and function. She no longer required pain medication and was able to resume activities she previously had difficulty with.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no major complications observed. She achieved successful rehabilitation following her knee replacement surgery and regained satisfactory function in her knee joint.
