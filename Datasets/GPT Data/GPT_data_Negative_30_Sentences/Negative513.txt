The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years. He takes amlodipine 10 mg daily and lisinopril 20 mg daily to manage his blood pressure. His blood pressure is well controlled with these medications. He also takes atorvastatin 40 mg daily for his hyperlipidemia. His cholesterol levels have been within normal limits while on this medication. His diabetes is managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. His hemoglobin A1c level has been consistently around 7% over the past year, indicating good glycemic control.

The patient does not have a significant surgical history but has undergone dental procedures in the past. He is not allergic to any medications and has no known drug intolerances. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease, with both parents having a history of heart attacks.

During the pre-operative evaluation, his laboratory investigations were within normal limits, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and lipid profile. His kidney function tests were also normal, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ². He does not have any signs or symptoms of renal dysfunction.

The patient's surgery is scheduled to be a hip replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. The surgical team has reviewed his medications and instructed him to continue taking them as prescribed, except for metformin, which should be held on the day of the surgery. Metformin can increase the risk of lactic acidosis in patients undergoing procedures with a potential for renal insufficiency.

Following the surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He received appropriate analgesia and antibiotics as per the surgical team's protocol. He was carefully monitored for any signs of infection, such as fever or wound drainage. The surgical wound healed well without any signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient was mobilized on the first postoperative day with the assistance of physical therapy. He was educated on the importance of deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. His pain was adequately controlled with oral analgesics.

He experienced no major complications during his hospital stay. The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout the postoperative period. His diabetes was managed with sliding-scale insulin while holding metformin temporarily. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and his glycemic control was maintained within the target range.

The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day in a stable condition. He was provided with a prescription for pain medication and instructions to continue his regular medications. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks to monitor wound healing and adjust his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications if needed.

During his follow-up visit, the patient reported no concerns or complications. His surgical wound had healed well, with no signs of infection or abnormal drainage. His blood pressure was within normal limits, and his glycemic control remained stable. He was advised to continue with his regular medications and follow a healthy lifestyle to manage his chronic conditions effectively.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, who underwent a hip replacement surgery. He had no complications during his postoperative course and was discharged home on the third day. His surgical wound healed well, and his blood pressure and glycemic control remained stable. He will continue to follow up with his primary care physician to ensure optimal management of his chronic conditions.
