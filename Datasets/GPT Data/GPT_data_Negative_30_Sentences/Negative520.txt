Patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history that includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His hypertension has been well controlled with medication, and he has had no recent cardiovascular events. He has been on a statin for the management of dyslipidemia and his lipid levels have been within target range. His diabetes mellitus has been managed with diet and exercise, and he has not required any insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications.

The patient has a history of tobacco use but quit smoking 10 years ago. He denies any recent respiratory symptoms and has not required any hospitalizations for respiratory issues. His lung function tests have been within normal limits. He does have a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction in his 60s.

Upon physical examination, the patient appears to be in good overall health. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, and his heart rate is regular at 70 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops on cardiac auscultation, and his lung fields are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Laboratory investigations reveal a normal complete blood count and coagulation profile. His renal function tests show a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, indicating normal kidney function. His liver function tests and electrolyte levels are within normal limits as well.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemic changes or arrhythmias. A chest X-ray reveals no acute abnormalities, and his lung fields appear clear.

The patient has been scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. The surgical procedure planned is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He has been instructed to fast for at least 8 hours prior to the surgery. He will be given prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure to prevent surgical site infections.

Postoperatively, the patient is monitored closely in the recovery room. He is initially tachycardic with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute but stabilizes within a few hours. His blood pressure remains within normal limits. He does not require any supplemental oxygen and his oxygen saturation remains above 95%. He is able to tolerate oral fluids and has no signs of postoperative nausea or vomiting.

The patient's pain is managed with a multimodal approach, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics as needed. He is encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis. His incisions are assessed regularly for signs of infection, but none are noted.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, and he is discharged home on the second postoperative day. He is advised to continue his regular medications and follow-up with his primary care provider in 2 weeks. He is also given instructions regarding postoperative wound care and signs of infection to watch for.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery with no major postoperative complications. He recovers well and experiences no acute renal failure or any other significant adverse events. The surgery achieved the intended goal of removing the gallbladder, and the patient is expected to have resolution of his preoperative symptoms. He will be followed up in the outpatient setting for long-term management of his chronic medical conditions.
