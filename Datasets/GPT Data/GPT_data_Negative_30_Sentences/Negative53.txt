The patient, a 45-year-old male, has a medical history significant for hypertension which is well-controlled on medications. He presents to the clinic with a need for surgery due to a suspected tumor in his gastrointestinal tract. The patient has never had surgery before, and therefore requires a detailed preoperative evaluation. His physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for some mild tenderness in the abdominal area.

In terms of his past medical history, the patient's only notable illness is hypertension, for which he has been taking an angiotensin receptor blocker. He denies any previous episodes of acute renal failure or kidney disease. All his recent labs indicate normal renal function, with no evidence of proteinuria or hematuria.

Regarding his surgical history, the patient has never undergone any surgical interventions previously. He has no known allergies to medications, and his vital signs are stable. His preoperative laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, are all within the normal range.

The patient is scheduled to undergo an exploratory laparotomy to confirm the presence of the suspected tumor and subsequently, if necessary, its surgical excision. The surgical oncology team, general surgeon, and anesthesiology team have been informed of the patient's medical history, and proper precautions will be taken during anesthesia and surgery to ensure excellent outcomes.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He initially showed signs of postoperative pain and was provided with appropriate analgesia. The surgical incision site was examined regularly for any signs of infection, but none were found. The patient was ambulating within 24 hours and resumed an oral diet with no issues.

Over the course of his recovery, the patient's renal function remained stable, and he remained normotensive without any medication adjustments. Follow-up laboratory tests consistently showed normal renal profiles, ruling out any acute renal failure. There were no signs of urinary retention or incontinence, and the patient's bowel function gradually returned to normal.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications such as wound dehiscence, hemorrhage, or surgical site infection. He was discharged on postoperative day 5 with written instructions for wound care, diet modifications, and follow-up appointments with both the surgical oncologist and his primary care provider.

In summary, this 45-year-old male with a history of well-controlled hypertension underwent an exploratory laparotomy for a suspected gastrointestinal tumor. He had no significant perioperative complications and his renal function remained stable throughout his hospital stay. The surgical site healed well, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 with an excellent prognosis.
