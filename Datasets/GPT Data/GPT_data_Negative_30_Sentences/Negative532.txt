The patient is a 57-year-old male who has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and is considering undergoing surgical intervention. His medical history reveals a previous myocardial infarction five years ago, which was successfully managed with percutaneous coronary intervention. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated multi-vessel coronary artery disease with significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery. Additionally, the patient has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with antihypertensive medications. He is a nonsmoker and denies any respiratory symptoms or previous lung disease. 

Furthermore, the patient's medication history includes aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. He denies any known drug allergies. His physical examination reveals stable vital signs, no murmurs, a regular rhythm, clear lung fields, and no peripheral edema. Echocardiography highlights a preserved left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%. Laboratory data demonstrate no significant abnormalities, with a normal complete blood count, renal function, and electrolyte levels.

To further assess the patient's condition, a stress test was performed, revealing moderate exercise-induced ischemia. Given the severity of his coronary artery disease, the patient is now planning to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He has been informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with the procedure, including the risk of bleeding, infection, anesthesia complications, and the need for a prolonged recovery period.

After undergoing CABG surgery, the patient's immediate postoperative course was uneventful. He was closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where his vital signs remained stable and his pain was adequately managed with analgesics. A pulmonary artery catheter was placed to ensure optimal cardiac output and fluid balance. Chest X-ray showed no signs of pulmonary edema or atelectasis.

The patient's postoperative recovery progressed smoothly with effective pain control. He was mobilized early and encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis. The surgical wound remained clean and dry, with no signs of infection. As per protocol, prophylactic antibiotics were administered perioperatively.

During his hospital stay, the patient attended cardiac rehabilitation sessions, which included exercise training, dietary counseling, and education on lifestyle modification. This comprehensive approach aimed to enhance the patient's recovery and minimize the risk of future cardiovascular events. Discharge planning began from the early postoperative period, ensuring an appropriate transition to a cardiac rehabilitation program and regular follow-up appointments with his cardiologist.

No major complications were encountered throughout the patient's postoperative course. There were no signs of myocardial infarction, stroke, or respiratory distress. Additionally, the patient did not develop any wound infections or require any interventions for bleeding or thromboembolic events. His renal function remained stable, and he did not experience acute renal failure or require renal replacement therapy. Further follow-up will be scheduled to assess the long-term outcomes of the patient's CABG surgery.
