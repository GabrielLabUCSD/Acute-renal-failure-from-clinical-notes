The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been on antihypertensive medication for the past five years and has his blood pressure well-controlled. He has been managing his diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents and monitoring his blood sugar regularly.

The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. The patient is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. His exercise tolerance is limited due to his uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, with his low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol persistently elevated despite statin therapy.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy 10 years ago without any complications. He has never had any major surgical procedures or hospitalizations since then. The patient has never had any anesthesia-related complications or adverse reactions to medications.

His preoperative workup reveals a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function. His echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function and no evidence of valvular disease. The patient's chest X-ray is unremarkable, with clear lung fields and no signs of cardiac enlargement.

The patient will be undergoing surgery for a left inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia. The risk of recurrent hernia is low based on the nature and size of the hernia. He will receive prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively to reduce the risk of surgical site infection. The anesthetic plan includes a balanced general anesthesia technique with endotracheal intubation.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored for any signs of infection, bleeding, or adverse reactions to anesthesia. He will be started on a liquid diet initially and gradually transitioned to a normal diet as tolerated. Pain management will be provided through a combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics. The patient will be encouraged to ambulate as early as possible to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Complications associated with surgery include infection, wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, seroma formation, urinary retention, and ileus. The patient's risk for these complications is relatively low considering his overall good health and the nature of the surgery.

Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled for the patient to monitor wound healing, ensure proper pain control, and evaluate for any signs of complications. The patient will be instructed to report any fever, worsening pain, redness or swelling of the surgical site, or difficulty urinating.

In summary, the 45-year-old male patient with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia is planning to have surgery for a left inguinal hernia repair. His preoperative workup is unremarkable, and he has no significant surgical history or anesthesia-related complications. The patient's postoperative course is expected to be uneventful, with a low risk of complications. Close monitoring and appropriate pain management will be provided to ensure optimal recovery.
