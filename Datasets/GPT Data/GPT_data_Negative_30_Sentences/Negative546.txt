He has a family history of myocardial infarction in his father at the age of 60. 

The patient is currently taking metoprolol for his hypertension and coronary artery disease, metformin for his diabetes, and atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia. He has been instructed to continue taking his medications until the day of surgery, with the exception of metformin, which will be temporarily held prior to surgery. 

He has been instructed to shower the night before and the morning of surgery with a special antibacterial soap. He has been advised to refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight the night before surgery, except for necessary medications as instructed by his healthcare provider. 

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. 

His physical examination was unremarkable, with no significant findings. 

Routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, were all within normal limits. 

The patient was seen by an anesthesiologist who confirmed that he is a suitable candidate for surgery. 

The patient is at a low risk for surgical complications based on his overall good health and well-controlled medical conditions. 

The surgery is expected to be performed under general anesthesia. 

The patient is anticipated to have an uneventful intraoperative course. 

The surgical procedure is estimated to take approximately two hours. 

The patient will be closely monitored during and after surgery to ensure his safety and stability. 

Postoperatively, the patient will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring and recovery. 

He will receive appropriate pain management as needed to ensure his comfort. 

The patient will be encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and blood clots. 

He will be started on prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infections.

He will be closely monitored for any signs of complications such as infection, bleeding, or delayed wound healing. 

The patient's family will be provided with necessary instructions and contact numbers in case of any concerns or emergencies during the postoperative period. 

Initial laboratory investigations postoperatively will include complete blood count, metabolic panel, and coagulation studies to ensure the patient's stability. 

The patient is expected to have a smooth postoperative course without any major complications. 

However, the risk of minor complications such as pain, nausea, or constipation may arise, which can be managed effectively. 

Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and address any ongoing concerns.
