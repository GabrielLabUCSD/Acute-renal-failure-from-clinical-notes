The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has been taking medications for these conditions for the past 10 years. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily but denies any illicit drug use. His family history is notable for diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy at the age of 20 and a cholecystectomy at the age of 40. He had an uneventful recovery from both surgeries. There are no known drug allergies, and his health maintenance is up to date, including vaccinations.

The patient reports occasional chest pain, which is relieved with rest. He does not experience dyspnea on exertion or palpitations. Upon further questioning, the patient states that his chest pain has been occurring for the past year. He denies any history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.

On physical examination, the patient's blood pressure is 145/92 mmHg, heart rate is 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. His body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. The cardiovascular system examination reveals normal heart sounds with regular rhythm. The lung examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory investigations show a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 160 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 180 mg/dL. The HbA1c level is 7.5%, and the renal function is within normal limits.

An electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes. An exercise stress test shows mild ST segment depression that is reversible on stress. The patient is referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Echocardiography reveals mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function and no significant valvular abnormalities. Based on these findings, the patient is diagnosed with stable angina.

The patient is advised to continue taking his antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antidiabetic medications. He is also counseled on smoking cessation and encouraged to make lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and a healthy diet.

The surgical team determines that the patient requires surgery due to symptomatic relief and to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events. The patient is scheduled for surgery in two weeks, and he is instructed to stop smoking and manage his diabetes strictly until the day of the operation.

On the day of surgery, the patient is admitted. His vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, are stable. Preoperative labs are within normal limits. The patient receives a beta blocker and aspirin before surgery as per protocol.

The surgery is performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient is closely monitored in the postoperative period. He is encouraged to deep breathe and ambulate early to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis. Pain management is addressed adequately.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experiences normal wound healing without signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's vital signs remain stable, without any signs of hypotension or tachycardia. His urinary output is within normal limits.

The patient recovers well and is discharged home after three days. He is provided with postoperative instructions, including wound care, activity restrictions, and medication management. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with his primary care physician and cardiologist in two weeks.

During the postoperative period, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or organ dysfunction. However, he continues to struggle with smoking cessation and diabetes management. Close monitoring and encouragement are provided to support his ongoing efforts in adopting a healthier lifestyle.
