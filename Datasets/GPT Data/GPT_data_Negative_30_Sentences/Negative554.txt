The surgical wound was clean and healing well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the postoperative course, with no episodes of hypotension or tachycardia noted.

Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was initiated postoperatively to prevent deep vein thrombosis, as per routine protocol. The patient was also encouraged to perform regular leg exercises and mobilize early to minimize the risk of postoperative complications.

This patient's successful outcome can be attributed to careful preoperative assessment, appropriate surgical technique, diligent postoperative care, and the absence of any significant comorbidities.
