He is a non-smoker and he does not have any known drug allergies. His surgical history includes an appendectomy 10 years ago without any complications.

In terms of his current medications, he is taking lisinopril for his hypertension and metformin for his diabetes.

The patient has no family history of any significant medical conditions and he does not report any known genetic disorders. His social history reveals that he works as an office manager and leads a sedentary lifestyle. He does not engage in regular exercise but does not have any mobility issues.

During the pre-operative assessment, the patient's physical examination revealed a well-healed surgical scar from his previous appendectomy. His vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate, were within normal limits. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, were within normal ranges.

The patient's surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The hernia repair was successful, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He was admitted to the surgical ward postoperatively for monitoring and pain management.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was kept on intravenous pain medications and a patient-controlled analgesia pump. He was also started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any surgical site infections. The wound was assessed regularly for signs of infection or dehiscence, but there were no abnormal findings.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with stable vital signs and minimal pain. He was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated and provided with appropriate pain management strategies, including medication and non-pharmacological interventions. The patient remained compliant with the prescribed pain medications and his pain was well-controlled throughout his hospital stay.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with instructions for wound care and pain management. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine postoperative check-up and removal of sutures in two weeks. He was also instructed to gradually increase his activity level and avoid lifting heavy objects for six weeks.

During his postoperative follow-up visit, the patient had an uncomplicated wound healing process, with no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. His sutures were removed without difficulty, and he reported minimal discomfort at the incision site. His blood pressure and blood sugar levels remained stable, reflecting good control of his chronic medical conditions.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery for hernia repair with an uneventful postoperative course. He did not experience any complications such as surgical site infection, wound dehiscence, or adverse reactions to medications. He was able to resume his normal activities gradually and his medical conditions remained well-controlled during the entire perioperative period.
