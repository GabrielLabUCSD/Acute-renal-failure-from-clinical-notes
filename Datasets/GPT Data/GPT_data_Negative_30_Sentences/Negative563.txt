The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. The patient has a BMI of 32 and is a smoker. He has been compliant with his antihypertensive medications but reports occasional difficulty controlling his blood sugar levels despite being on oral hypoglycemic agents. His lipid levels are well-managed on statin therapy.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient had a appendectomy 20 years ago without any complications. He has no known drug allergies or adverse reactions to any medications. The patient reports using over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs occasionally for joint pain, but is not currently taking any.

Upon physical examination, the patient is found to have well-controlled blood pressure, with no evidence of end-organ damage. His cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Laboratory tests reveal a normal complete blood count and coagulation profile.

The patient's preoperative workup includes an electrocardiogram, which shows normal sinus rhythm, and a chest X-ray, which is normal. An abdominal ultrasound confirms the presence of gallstones and their association with symptomatic cholecystitis.

The patient meets with the anesthesiologist prior to surgery and is deemed to be at an average risk for anesthesia-related complications. The surgical team plans to use general anesthesia for the procedure, and the patient is counseled on the potential risks and benefits.

During the surgery, the patient is positioned supine and undergoes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure is uneventful and lasting approximately one hour. The surgeon notes the presence of multiple gallstones and dilated bile ducts. There are no complications observed during the surgery, and the patient is transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

In the postoperative period, the patient is monitored closely for any signs of pain, infection, or postoperative complications. He is started on a clear liquid diet initially and subsequently advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. The patient's pain is well-controlled with oral analgesics.

During his hospital stay, the patient receives appropriate deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and is encouraged to perform active range of motion exercises to prevent postoperative complications. He receives education on wound care and signs of infection.

The patient's postoperative course is unremarkable, and he is able to tolerate a regular diet without any gastrointestinal symptoms. He does not require any further intravenous pain medication and is transitioned to oral pain medications for discharge.

In terms of complications, the patient does not exhibit any signs of wound infection, surgical site bleeding, or bile duct injury. He does not experience any major postoperative complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or thromboembolic events.

During the follow-up visit, the patient is healing well, and his surgical incisions are clean and dry. He reports minimal pain and is advised to continue his regular medications. The patient is counseled on smoking cessation and the importance of achieving better blood sugar control.

Overall, the patient's surgery goes smoothly, and he has a favorable postoperative course without complications.
