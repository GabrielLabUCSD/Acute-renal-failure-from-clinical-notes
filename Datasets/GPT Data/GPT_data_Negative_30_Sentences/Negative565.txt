The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He presents with severe joint pain and functional limitations in his right knee. After discussion with his orthopedic surgeon, he has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's blood pressure is well controlled on a combination of antihypertensive medications, including lisinopril and amlodipine. He has a previous history of myocardial infarction but has made a full recovery and has been on aspirin and atorvastatin for secondary prevention.

The preoperative workup includes a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, coagulation profile, and an electrocardiogram, all of which were within normal limits. The patient's preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular function with no significant valvular abnormalities.

He is preoperatively optimized by discontinuing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and initiating physical therapy to improve strength and range of motion around the knee joint. The patient has been educated about the surgical procedure, risks, and expected outcomes.

The surgery is performed uneventfully under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. The surgeon reports no significant intraoperative complications, and the prosthetic knee is successfully implanted.

Postoperatively, the patient is managed in the orthopedic ward. He is closely monitored for pain control, wound healing, and signs of infection. Physical therapy is initiated soon after surgery to aid in ambulation and restore joint range of motion.

The patient's wound heals well without any signs of infection. He is started on oral analgesics for pain management and is able to bear weight on the operated leg with the assistance of a walker on the first postoperative day.

His postoperative course is unremarkable, with regular assessments conducted to monitor his progress. The physical therapist works with the patient on a daily basis to enhance his mobility and strengthen his knee.

Complications, however, occur on the fourth postoperative day when the patient develops a superficial surgical site infection. The infection is promptly identified, and appropriate measures are taken, including wound care, antibiotic therapy, and close monitoring. The patient shows a good response to treatment, with the infection resolving within a week.

Following resolution of the infection, the patient's postoperative course continues smoothly. He demonstrates significant improvement in his knee function, with reduced pain and increased range of motion. The patient is discharged home on postoperative day 10 with a plan for outpatient physical therapy and a follow-up appointment in two weeks.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, with the infection being the only noteworthy complication encountered and appropriately managed. With proper rehabilitation and ongoing care, the patient is expected to continue experiencing long-term benefits from the total knee replacement surgery.
