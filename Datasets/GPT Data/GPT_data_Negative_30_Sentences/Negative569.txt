The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been managing his conditions with medications, including aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and insulin. 

The patient is planning to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. He has had chronic knee pain and limited mobility for the past two years despite conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medications. Preoperative imaging showed significant joint degeneration and bone-on-bone contact. 

His preoperative assessment reveals well-controlled blood pressure, stable glycemic control, and no signs of acute renal failure. His laboratory values, including renal function, are within normal limits. The patient does not have any known drug allergies or previous adverse reactions to anesthesia.

He currently smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and has a 20-year smoking history. The patient acknowledges the harmful effects of smoking and expresses a desire to quit but has been unsuccessful in his attempts. The surgeon and anesthesia team provide him with smoking cessation resources and strongly advise him to quit smoking prior to surgery.

During the patient's hospitalization for the surgery, he is likely to benefit from cardiac monitoring due to his history of coronary artery disease. An anesthesiologist will be involved in managing his medications and ensuring safe induction and maintenance of anesthesia.

Postoperatively, the patient will be managed in the surgical ward, where he will receive analgesics for pain control and undergo physical therapy to regain knee joint range of motion and strength. His glucose levels will be closely monitored to maintain stable glycemic control.

The patient is at risk for postsurgical complications due to his comorbidities. Surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pneumonia are potential risks. To mitigate these risks, perioperative prophylactic antibiotics, sequential compression devices, and early mobility will be implemented. Incentive spirometry will be used to encourage deep breathing and prevent respiratory complications.

He is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the surgeon two weeks after the surgery to assess the incision site, discuss pain management, and evaluate progress in physical therapy. Further outpatient follow-up appointments will be scheduled as needed based on his recovery.

The patient's postoperative course will be closely monitored for any signs of complications. Early mobilization and ongoing physical therapy are essential for a successful recovery. The healthcare team will provide education on wound care, signs of infection, and the importance of adherence to prescribed medications.

Complications can include wound dehiscence, delayed wound healing, persistent pain, limited range of motion, and residual joint stiffness. If any complications arise, appropriate interventions will be implemented promptly to address them.

It is crucial for the patient to adhere to the recommended postoperative care plan, including medication regimen, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation and maintaining glycemic control. This will optimize his recovery and long-term outcomes following the knee replacement surgery.
