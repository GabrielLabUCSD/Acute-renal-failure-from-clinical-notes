The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications for the past five years. There is no evidence of end-organ damage related to his hypertension. His blood pressure has been consistently well controlled on pharmacotherapy.

His hyperlipidemia has been managed with lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and exercise. He has not required lipid-lowering medications thus far. The patient has undergone routine lipid profile testing every six months, and his levels have remained within normal range.

In terms of his social history, the patient is a non-smoker and reports minimal alcohol intake. He engages in regular exercise and maintains a healthy weight. There are no known drug allergies.

The surgical procedure that the patient is planning to undergo is an elective cholecystectomy due to the presence of symptomatic gallstones. The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of right upper quadrant pain for the past six months. The pain is usually provoked by high-fat meals and is associated with mild nausea. Ultrasonographic examination revealed multiple gallstones, and the patient opted for surgical intervention due to the recurrent nature of his symptoms.

The patient underwent preoperative evaluation, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and electrocardiogram. All laboratory results were within normal range, and his electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities. A baseline echocardiogram was also obtained, which demonstrated normal left ventricular function with no valvular abnormalities.

An anesthesiology consult was sought to evaluate the patient's suitability for surgery. The anesthesiologist reviewed the patient's medical history, including his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient was deemed medically optimized for surgery, and general anesthesia was planned.

The patient underwent an uneventful cholecystectomy. Intraoperative findings confirmed the presence of multiple gallstones without evidence of complications such as gangrene or perforation. The procedure was carried out laparoscopically, and there were no intraoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uncomplicated. He received routine postoperative pain management and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. The patient ambulated on the same day of surgery and was discharged home on postoperative day one after meeting all discharge criteria.

He was advised to continue his antihypertensive medications and to follow up with his primary care physician for blood pressure monitoring. Additionally, he was counseled on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent further cardiovascular complications.

During the follow-up period, the patient reported no complications such as wound infection, bile leak, or bile duct injury. He had a routine postoperative visit with the surgeon two weeks after surgery, where he reported resolution of his preoperative symptoms and expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome.

In terms of postoperative complications, the patient developed a minor surgical site infection that resolved with oral antibiotics. The infection was characterized by mild redness and localized swelling over the incision site. No signs of systemic infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, were present.

Despite this minor complication, the patient's overall postoperative course was considered successful. He achieved symptom resolution and had an uneventful recovery.

It is important to note that the patient did not experience acute renal failure as a complication during his surgical journey.
