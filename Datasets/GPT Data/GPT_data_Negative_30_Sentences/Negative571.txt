The patient's preoperative electrocardiogram is unremarkable, showing sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemic changes or arrhythmias. Chest x-ray reveals no acute abnormalities, and pulmonary function test results are normal.

Cardiology consultation was obtained due to the patient's comorbidities. An exercise stress test was conducted, which showed a negative result for inducible ischemia. No significant cardiac abnormalities were identified, and the patient was deemed low risk for surgery.
