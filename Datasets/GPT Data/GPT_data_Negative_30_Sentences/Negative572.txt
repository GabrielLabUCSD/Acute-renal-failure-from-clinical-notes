The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. He presents to the hospital for preoperative assessment as he is planning to have surgery for the removal of a gallbladder stone. The patient's gallstone symptoms include intermittent right upper quadrant pain, which has been occurring for the past six months. His pain is exacerbated by fatty meals and is associated with nausea and vomiting. In addition, the patient has experienced significant weight loss of 10 kilograms over the past six months. 

The patient's blood pressure is well controlled on antihypertensive medication, with an average reading of 130/80 mmHg. His blood glucose levels are elevated, with an HbA1c level of 8.5%. He is currently on metformin for glycemic control. His body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2, indicating obesity. The patient has a smoking history of 10 pack-years but quit five years ago.

Laboratory investigations reveal a mildly elevated liver enzyme level but are otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound confirms the presence of a single 2 cm gallstone within the gallbladder. The patient has been educated about the surgical procedure, risks, and benefits, and has consented to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

During the postoperative period, the patient recovers well from anesthesia and is transferred to the surgical ward for further monitoring. He is started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to regular meals over the next 24 hours. The patient is encouraged to ambulate frequently to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with minimal pain controlled by oral analgesics. He has normal bowel movements, no evidence of fever, and regular wound inspection reveals intact sutures. The patient's blood glucose levels are monitored closely, and adjustments are made to his antidiabetic medication to maintain glycemic control.

On the second postoperative day, the patient is found to be afebrile and displays satisfactory wound healing. He is discharged home with appropriate postoperative care instructions, including wound care, medication management, and activity restrictions. 

Follow-up appointments are scheduled for one week postoperatively to assess wound healing and discuss any concerns. The patient is advised to contact his healthcare provider immediately if he experiences worsening pain, persistent fever, or any signs of infection.

The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he did not experience any major complications such as surgical site infection, bleeding, or bile leakage. He was able to resume his regular activities and reported resolution of his preoperative symptoms. The patient's weight loss and smoking cessation were considered positive factors contributing to his overall recovery.

In summary, this 45-year-old male patient with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity presented with symptomatic gallstones. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any significant perioperative complications. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home with appropriate instructions for wound care and follow-up.
