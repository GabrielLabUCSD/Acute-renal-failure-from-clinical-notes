The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been taking lisinopril and simvastatin for the management of these conditions. He is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

After a thorough evaluation, it was determined that the patient requires surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. He has been experiencing increasing groin pain and discomfort for the past few months, which have begun to limit his daily activities. Given the severity of his symptoms, surgical intervention is deemed necessary.

Preoperative investigations, including blood tests, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram, were all within normal limits. The patient's vital signs were stable, and he exhibited no signs of acute illness on physical examination.

On the day of surgery, the patient was given a general anesthetic and taken to the operating room. The surgical team performed an open tension-free mesh repair of the inguinal hernia. The procedure was completed without any intraoperative complications, and the patient tolerated the surgery well.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. He received appropriate pain management, including intravenous opioids, to keep his pain well controlled. His vital signs remained stable, and he exhibited no signs of infection or bleeding at the surgical site.

The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and blood clots. He was provided with clear instructions on wound care and advised to contact his surgeon immediately in case of any concerns.

Over the next few days, the patient reported a gradual improvement in his pain and overall mobility. He was discharged home on the second postoperative day with oral pain medication and detailed instructions for wound care and activity restrictions.

During the follow-up appointment one week later, the patient's surgical wound appeared to be healing well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. He reported minimal pain and was able to resume his daily activities without limitations.

In terms of complications, the patient experienced no significant adverse events during his postoperative course. His recovery followed a typical trajectory, and he did not require any additional medical interventions.

To prevent any future recurrent hernias, the patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting and to maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise and a balanced diet. He was scheduled for routine follow-up appointments with his surgeon to ensure ongoing monitoring of his surgical site and overall well-being.

In summary, the patient's surgery for an inguinal hernia repair was successful without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. He experienced a smooth recovery and is expected to have an excellent long-term outcome following the surgical intervention.
