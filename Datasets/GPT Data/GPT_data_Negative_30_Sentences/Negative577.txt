The patient is a 55-year-old female who presented with chronic lower back pain and was diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation. She has been experiencing persistent pain for the past six months and conservative treatments, such as physical therapy, have been unsuccessful in providing significant relief.

Her medical history includes hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. She had a myocardial infarction five years ago but has since made a full recovery. The patient also has a history of mild asthma, which is managed with an inhaler as needed.

The decision to proceed with surgery was made after a thorough evaluation by a spine specialist, who recommended a discectomy procedure. Preoperative imaging, which included an MRI of the lumbar spine, confirmed the presence of a herniated disc at the L4-L5 level.

The patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia. The discectomy was performed utilizing a microsurgical technique, allowing for minimal tissue disruption and a smaller incision. Intraoperative findings were consistent with the preoperative imaging, and the surgeon successfully removed the herniated disc material, decompressing the affected nerve root.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of complications. She experienced mild postoperative pain, which was effectively managed with oral analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization and rehabilitation.

Within the first week after surgery, the patient's pain significantly improved and she regained strength and sensation in her lower extremities. There were no signs of infection or wound complications at the incision site, which was healing well. The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day with instructions for activity modification and a gradual return to daily activities.

During the first postoperative month, the patient experienced a few episodes of low-grade fever, which resolved spontaneously within 24 hours without any other associated symptoms. She also reported occasional mild muscle spasms in the lower back, which were managed conservatively with muscle relaxants.

At the six-week postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reported complete resolution of her preoperative symptoms and was very satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. The incision site had completely healed, and there were no signs of infection or inflammation. The patient was encouraged to continue with physical therapy to further strengthen her back muscles and reduce the risk of future disc herniation.

In conclusion, the patient underwent a successful lumbar discectomy for a herniated disc at the L4-L5 level. Her postoperative course was uneventful, with minimal pain and no complications. With appropriate rehabilitation and continued management of her chronic conditions, the patient is expected to have a good long-term prognosis.
