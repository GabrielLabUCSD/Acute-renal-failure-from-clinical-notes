He was closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of complications, including bleeding, infection, or respiratory distress. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any immediate adverse reactions to anesthesia.

Routine postoperative laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count and coagulation profile, were performed and revealed no abnormalities. Mr. Smith's incision site was inspected, and there were no signs of infection or delayed wound healing.

Postoperatively, Mr. Smith was started on oral analgesics, including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, to manage his pain. He tolerated these medications well and did not require additional opioids for pain control during his hospital stay.

Physical therapy was initiated on the second postoperative day to facilitate early mobilization and rehabilitation. Mr. Smith actively participated in his physical therapy sessions and demonstrated steady progress in regaining his range of motion and ambulation.

No complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism were noted during his hospital stay. His vital signs remained stable, with no evidence of tachycardia or hypotension.

Overall, Mr. Smith had a successful surgical procedure and an uneventful postoperative course. He responded well to pain management strategies and achieved his targeted mobility goals. His family was actively involved in his care and provided significant support throughout his recovery process.
