The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for the treatment of a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed with diet and exercise. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient's preoperative evaluation includes a complete physical examination, blood work, and imaging studies. Preoperative laboratory results revealed normal values for complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and coagulation profile. Imaging studies indicated a single-level herniated disc at L4-L5 on the lumbar spine MRI.

In terms of the patient's surgical history, he has not had any prior spinal surgeries. However, he has undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease five years ago without any complications.

During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia, and a laminectomy was performed at the L4-L5 level to decompress the nerve roots. The procedure was successfully completed without any intraoperative complications.

In the postoperative period, the patient initially experienced pain at the incision site, which was managed with opioid analgesics. He was also started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to aid in his recovery and improve mobility.

The patient had a smooth postoperative course with gradual improvement in his pain and functional abilities. He was monitored closely for signs of infection, such as fever or increased pain, but none were observed. The wound healed well without signs of dehiscence or erythema.

No postoperative complications, such as wound infections, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism, were reported. The patient's blood glucose levels remained stable throughout the hospital stay, and he did not require any additional diabetes management. His blood pressure was also well-controlled with antihypertensive medication.

On the third postoperative day, the patient was able to tolerate a regular diet and was cleared for discharge. He was provided with instructions for wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments. The patient was advised to gradually increase his physical activity, avoid heavy lifting, and refrain from driving for a few weeks.

During the follow-up visit one month after surgery, the patient reported significant improvement in his back pain and resolution of his preoperative symptoms. He had regained his baseline functional abilities and was no longer experiencing any limitations in his daily activities.

Overall, this patient with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent a successful surgery for a herniated lumbar disc, without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. The surgery and subsequent recovery led to improved pain control, functional abilities, and quality of life for the patient.
