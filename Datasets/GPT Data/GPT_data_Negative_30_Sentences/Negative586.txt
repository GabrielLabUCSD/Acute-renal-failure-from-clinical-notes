During his hospital stay, the patient was seen regularly by a physical therapist who provided education on proper body mechanics and exercises to improve his back strength. He was also started on a regimen of oral pain medication to be continued at home. 

The patient's surgical incision was monitored for signs of infection, and he was instructed to keep the area clean and dry. He was discharged home on the fourth postoperative day with instructions for wound care and activity restrictions. 

In the outpatient setting, the patient had regular follow-up appointments with the surgeon to monitor his progress. He continued to make improvements in his pain level and functionality. He was advised to continue with physical therapy and to gradually increase his activity level.
