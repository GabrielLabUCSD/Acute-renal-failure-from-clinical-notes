The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, controlled with medication. The patient also has a past surgical history of appendectomy and hernia repair. He does not have any known drug allergies.

His primary care physician noted that the patient's blood pressure readings have been within normal limits for the past year. The patient reports occasional chest discomfort, which was investigated with an exercise stress test, which came back negative for ischemic changes. He smokes 10 cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally.

The patient's laboratory tests reveal a normal complete blood count with no signs of anemia or infection. His blood chemistry shows normal liver and kidney function. The patient's fasting blood glucose levels are within the normal range, ruling out diabetes.

Upon reviewing the patient's imaging studies, the radiologist noted mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine but no signs of nerve compression. A recent chest X-ray was unremarkable, with clear lung fields and normal heart size.

During the preoperative evaluation, the anesthesiologist assessed the patient's physical condition and determined him to be of average surgical risk. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. His respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were also within normal limits.

The patient was advised to discontinue smoking at least two weeks before the surgery to reduce the risk of complications. He was instructed on deep breathing exercises and coughing techniques to prevent postoperative respiratory complications. The patient expressed understanding and agreed to comply with the recommendations.

On the day of surgery, the patient was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was induced. The surgery lasted approximately two hours and was completed without any complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

During the postoperative course, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was able to maintain adequate respiratory function without the need for supplemental oxygen. The patient was closely monitored for pain control, and he received analgesic medications as needed. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform incentive spirometry to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia.

The patient's surgical incision was inspected daily for signs of infection. The wound appeared clean, with no signs of erythema, induration, or discharge. The patient had good oral intake and passed gas regularly, indicating normal bowel function.

As the patient continued to recover, he was gradually weaned off pain medications. His ambulation distance increased each day, and he was able to perform activities of daily living independently. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day four with oral pain medication and specific instructions for wound care.

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reported minimal pain and no signs of wound infection. The surgical wound was well-healed without any complications. The patient was advised to continue the prescribed pain medication as needed and to gradually resume normal physical activities.

In conclusion, the patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and a past surgical history of appendectomy and hernia repair, underwent surgery without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, with stable vital signs, adequate pain control, and normal wound healing. The patient followed all postoperative instructions and had a successful recovery.
