The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient takes medications for these conditions, including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had a cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. He had an uneventful postoperative course with no complications related to the surgery.

The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having suffered from a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. He has been advised to undergo regular cardiac screenings and has undergone stress testing in the past, which has been normal.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient was found to have well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. His most recent HbA1c level was 6.7%, indicating fair glycemic control. He was advised to continue his regular medications leading up to the surgery.

In terms of lifestyle factors, the patient is a current smoker with a 30 pack-year history. He has expressed interest in quitting smoking and has been referred to smoking cessation programs.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent routine preoperative laboratory testing, which revealed normal complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and liver function tests. However, an elevated serum creatinine level was noted, but this was attributed to his underlying chronic kidney disease, which has been stable.

The patient was also seen by an anesthesiologist who determined that he is a good candidate for general anesthesia. The patient was advised to avoid food and drink after midnight on the day of surgery and to take his regular medications with a sip of water on the morning of the procedure.

The patient's surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications. The surgical team reported that the procedure went smoothly and as planned. The patient was monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and did not experience any significant postoperative pain or nausea.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels were closely monitored.

The patient's renal function was also monitored postoperatively, and no significant changes were noted. His serum creatinine remained stable, consistent with his baseline chronic kidney disease.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient received regular visits from physical therapy to assist with ambulation and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to promote lung expansion.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with appropriate wound care instructions. He was prescribed postoperative pain medication and was advised to continue his regular medications.

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reported minimal incisional pain and had no signs of infection. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels were within target range, indicating good postoperative management of his chronic conditions.

The patient did not experience any complications related to the surgery, such as wound dehiscence, infection, or bleeding. He was referred to cardiac rehabilitation to address his cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking cessation.

In summary, this 55-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent surgery without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. His chronic kidney disease remained stable, and his postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged home in a stable condition, and appropriate follow-up plans were made to address his cardiovascular risk factors.
