During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia, and the cholecystectomy was performed laparoscopically. The procedure went smoothly and without any complications. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the recovery room postoperatively.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely for pain control, vital signs stability, and wound healing. He was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. His bowels resumed normal function on the second postoperative day.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as atelectasis and thromboembolism. He received prophylactic subcutaneous heparin injections to prevent venous thromboembolism.

The patient's vital signs remained stable, with no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. His pain was well-managed with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He was discharged on postoperative day three in stable condition.

During the first follow-up appointment, the patient reported a significant improvement in his symptoms related to gallstone disease. His surgical incisions were healing well without signs of infection or dehiscence. He was instructed to gradually resume his regular activities and to avoid heavy lifting for a few weeks.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and he did not experience any complications related to the cholecystectomy. He remained normotensive and had well-controlled blood sugar levels throughout the recovery period and beyond.

Overall, the patient had a successful cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease, with an uneventful postoperative course. He experienced a resolution of symptoms and had no complications related to the surgery. It is essential for him to continue managing his hypertension and diabetes medications to maintain optimal control of these conditions. Long-term follow-up will be arranged to ensure his ongoing well-being and monitor for any potential late complications.
