The patient is a 52-year-old male with a significant medical history. He has a history of hypertension, which is well controlled with medications. He also has type 2 diabetes, which is managed with diet and exercise. The patient has a history of smoking but quit five years ago.

The patient is scheduled to have surgery for a hernia repair. It is important to note that the patient has previously undergone two abdominal surgeries for appendicitis and cholecystectomy. Both procedures were uncomplicated, and the patient had a smooth recovery.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation, including blood work, chest x-ray, and an EKG. All results were within normal limits, and the patient was cleared for surgery. The patient was also advised to stop smoking for at least two weeks before the procedure to reduce the risk of complications.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Intraoperatively, the surgeon noted a small incisional hernia and repaired it successfully. There were no intraoperative complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. He experienced mild pain at the incision site, which was managed with intravenous pain medications. He was transitioned to oral pain medications as tolerated. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and take deep breaths to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

The patient's incision site was assessed daily for signs of infection. Regular dressing changes were performed, and there were no signs of wound dehiscence or infection. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period.

On the third postoperative day, the patient's bowel movements resumed, indicating normal gastrointestinal function. He was started on a regular diet and tolerated it well. The patient's pain continued to improve, and he was able to mobilize without difficulty.

At the one-week follow-up appointment, the patient's surgical incision was healing well, with no signs of infection or complications. The patient reported minimal pain and was gradually tapering off the pain medications. He was advised to continue taking antibiotics, as prescribed, to reduce the risk of infection.

At the four-week follow-up visit, the patient's incision site was fully healed, and he reported no pain or discomfort. The patient was cleared to resume all normal activities and instructed to follow up as needed if any concerns arise.

In conclusion, the patient's hernia repair surgery was successful, and he had an uneventful postoperative course. He did not experience any complications related to the surgery. The patient's prior history of hypertension and diabetes was well-managed, and no issues were noted during the perioperative period. It is important to note that the patient did not develop acute renal failure as a complication.
