The patient is a 60-year-old male who has a significant medical history prior to his planned surgery. He has a history of hypertension, which has been well-controlled on medication. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is managed with oral antidiabetic medications. Additionally, he has a history of hyperlipidemia. His cholesterol levels have been well-managed with a statin medication.

The patient has a past surgical history that includes a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. He has had no complications related to this procedure. He has never undergone any other major surgeries but has had minor procedures such as dental extractions.

His current medications include lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He reports good medication compliance and has not experienced any adverse effects from these medications.

The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. He has been advised to undergo surgical intervention due to a newly diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5 cm in diameter. The aneurysm has been closely monitored with regular ultrasound imaging, and surgical intervention is now warranted to prevent rupture.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a complete cardiovascular workup, which included an ECG, stress test, and echocardiogram. The results showed no evidence of significant cardiac abnormalities, and his left ventricular function was within normal limits.

Lab results prior to surgery revealed normal kidney function with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 ml/min/1.73m². His liver function tests and coagulation profile were also within normal limits.

The patient underwent successful open repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm. The surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient received adequate anesthesia and tolerated the surgery well.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). He was extubated on postoperative day 1 and his respiratory status was stable throughout his hospital stay. He received appropriate pain management and his vital signs remained stable.

The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. He was encouraged to ambulate early and was able to tolerate walking with assistance. His bowel function returned within the expected timeframe, and he did not experience any complications such as ileus.

During his hospital stay, the patient was closely monitored for any signs of infection or wound complications. No evidence of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence was noted. His incision site was clean and well-approximated.

The patient’s postoperative labs, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, remained stable. His serum creatinine and eGFR were within normal limits.

There were no signs of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure during the patient’s hospital stay. His cardiac rhythm remained regular, and he did not experience any respiratory distress or signs of pulmonary embolism.

The patient received appropriate deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and did not develop any thromboembolic complications.

He was discharged on postoperative day 5 with appropriate wound care and pain management instructions. His mobility improved, and he was able to navigate stairs without difficulties. The patient was advised to follow up for routine postoperative visits with his surgeon and primary care physician.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgical intervention for his abdominal aortic aneurysm. His postoperative course was uneventful with no major complications noted. The patient will continue to be monitored closely for any signs of aneurysm recurrence or development of new cardiovascular issues in the future.
