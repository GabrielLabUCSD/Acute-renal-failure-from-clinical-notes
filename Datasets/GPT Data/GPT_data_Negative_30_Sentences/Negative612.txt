The patient had a preoperative chest x-ray, which showed no abnormalities. An electrocardiogram was also obtained, demonstrating normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of arrhythmias or ischemic changes. 

During the procedure, the patient was placed under general anesthesia, and an incision was made to access the inguinal area. The hernia was visualized and repaired using a tension-free mesh technique. The procedure was completed without any intraoperative complications.

Following surgery, the patient was monitored in the recovery room for a brief period. He tolerated the surgery well and displayed stable vital signs throughout the postoperative period. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet and advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.

Over the next few weeks, the patient had regular follow-up appointments with his surgeon to monitor the healing process and ensure there were no complications. At each visit, the surgical site was examined for signs of infection or recurrence. 

The patient exhibited a satisfactory postoperative recovery, devoid of any complications such as wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, or seroma formation. He reported a gradual improvement in pain and mobility, enabling him to resume his regular activities after three weeks.
