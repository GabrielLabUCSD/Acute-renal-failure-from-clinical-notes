The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. He has been experiencing increasing joint pain and limited mobility in his right knee. After multiple consultations with orthopedic surgeons, he has opted for a total knee replacement surgery to alleviate his symptoms.

His blood pressure has been well controlled with medications, and he denies any previous cardiac issues. Furthermore, he has not undergone any major surgeries in the past and has had no prior complications with anesthesia. 

During the preoperative evaluation, routine blood work, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, was performed. His results were within normal limits. The patient also underwent an electrocardiogram, which showed sinus rhythm and no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia. Chest X-ray revealed clear lung fields and no significant abnormalities.

In preparation for surgery, the patient has been advised to discontinue anticoagulant medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs one week before the procedure. He received patient education regarding postoperative pain management, wound care, and physical therapy to promote a speedy recovery. He understands the importance of adhering to these guidelines.

The patient was admitted to the hospital on the morning of the surgery. Anesthesia was induced using general anesthesia, and an endotracheal tube was inserted for airway management. The surgical procedure lasted approximately two and a half hours, during which a total knee replacement was performed successfully by the orthopedic surgeon.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of complications. He was prescribed intravenous pain medication initially, which was later transitioned to oral analgesics as tolerated. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization and prevent stiffness and muscle atrophy.

The patient tolerated the surgery well and did not experience any immediate postoperative complications. His vital signs remained stable throughout the hospital stay, with no signs of infection or wound-related issues. The surgical wound was clean, dry, and intact without any signs of redness, swelling, or drainage.

He continued to receive physical therapy and was able to bear weight on the affected leg with the assistance of a walker. The patient was also instructed on performing range-of-motion exercises to improve joint flexibility. He demonstrated good compliance and quick progress in his mobility.

During the hospital stay, he received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin injections and was ordered sequential compression devices to prevent venous thromboembolism. The patient was educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications and the importance of seeking medical attention promptly.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day three with a prescription for oral pain medication and performed follow-up scheduled visits with the orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist. The surgeon was pleased with his progress and instructed him to gradually increase weight-bearing and range-of-motion exercises over time.

In summary, the patient with a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery without any immediate postoperative complications. He received appropriate postoperative pain management and physical therapy interventions, allowing for early mobilization. The patient was discharged with instructions for continued rehabilitation and close follow-up care.
