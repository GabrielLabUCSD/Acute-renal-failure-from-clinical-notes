The patient is scheduled to have surgery and their medical history includes a number of relevant factors. Firstly, they have a history of asthma, which has been well-managed with inhalers and has not required any recent hospitalizations. Additionally, the patient has a history of hypertension, which is controlled with regular medication and has remained stable over time.

The patient is a non-smoker and has never had any previous surgeries. They have no known allergies to any medications or anesthetic agents. Current medications include a daily aspirin for cardiovascular protection, which they have been taking for several years without any issues.

In terms of past medical conditions, the patient had a bout of pneumonia two years ago, which was successfully treated with antibiotics and did not result in any complications or further respiratory issues. They also had a minor ankle fracture ten years ago, which healed without any complications or long-term impairment.

On examination, the patient appears to be in good overall health, with no current complaints or symptoms related to their medical history. Blood pressure is well-controlled, and there are no signs of respiratory distress or abnormal lung sounds. Preoperative blood work indicates normal renal function, liver function, and electrolyte levels.

In terms of the planned surgery, it is a routine procedure with a low risk of complications. The surgical team has taken into account the patient's medical history and made appropriate preparations. The patient has been adequately informed about the nature of the procedure, potential risks, and benefits, and has provided informed consent.

Postoperatively, the patient's recovery has been uneventful. They were closely monitored in the post-anesthesia recovery unit and experienced no immediate complications such as excessive bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to medications. Vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period, and the patient reported minimal pain or discomfort.

Within the first 24 hours following surgery, the patient was able to resume a regular diet and mobilize without difficulty. They were provided with appropriate pain management and wound care instructions. The surgical site was well-approximated and showed no signs of infection or dehiscence.

In the days following surgery, the patient continued to recover well. Their pain gradually subsided with the prescribed pain medication, and they were able to gradually increase their activity level as tolerated. The patient was instructed to monitor for signs of infection at the surgical site, such as redness, swelling, or drainage, and to promptly report any concerns to their healthcare provider.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and they did not experience any complications during their recovery period. They were discharged home within the expected timeframe, with follow-up appointments scheduled to monitor their progress and ensure proper healing.

It is important to note that although the patient did not develop any acute renal failure as a complication, their renal function was continually monitored throughout the surgical process, and appropriate measures were taken to ensure the health and safety of the patient's kidneys.
