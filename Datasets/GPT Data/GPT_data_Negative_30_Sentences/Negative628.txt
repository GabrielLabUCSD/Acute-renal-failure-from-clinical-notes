The patient is a 50-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The patient takes medications including lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin on a daily basis. He has a past surgical history of a coronary artery bypass graft performed five years ago. The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father passing away from a heart attack at the age of 60.

Upon physical examination, the patient is found to have well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. His cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs or extra sounds. The patient's carotid and peripheral pulses are intact, and there are no signs of lower extremity edema. Laboratory tests indicate normal renal and liver function, with no pre-existing renal impairment.

In terms of preoperative evaluations, the patient has undergone a comprehensive assessment including a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. The chest X-ray is unremarkable, showing clear lungs and a normal cardiac silhouette. The electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm and no signs of acute ischemia or arrhythmias. The echocardiogram demonstrates preserved left ventricular function and no significant valvular abnormalities.

Given the patient's medical history and risk factors, a multidisciplinary team has been involved in the decision-making process. The patient has undergone a thorough discussion regarding the benefits and risks of the planned surgery, including the potential for postoperative complications. He has provided informed consent and understands the need for perioperative monitoring.

Following the surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was closely monitored in the surgical intensive care unit for the first 24 hours to assess for any immediate complications. In terms of pain management, a multimodal approach was used, combining intravenous opioids with non-opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period, with no significant fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate. His surgical incision was examined regularly for signs of infection or dehiscence, and proper wound care was implemented. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin was initiated to prevent the occurrence of blood clots.

The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet within 24 hours post-surgery without experiencing any gastrointestinal complications. His urine output remained within normal limits, and there were no signs of urinary retention or urinary tract infection. Adequate hydration was maintained throughout the postoperative period to prevent any electrolyte imbalances.

In terms of mobility, the patient was encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. Physical therapy sessions were scheduled to aid in his recovery and improve functional mobility.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day three. He was educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications such as wound infection, fever, and shortness of breath. Instructions for medication management, diet modifications, and follow-up appointments were provided.

No significant postoperative complications were observed in the patient's case. His surgical incision healed well without any signs of infection or wound dehiscence. He did not experience any acute renal failure during his hospital stay. Overall, the patient had a successful surgery and an uncomplicated postoperative course.
