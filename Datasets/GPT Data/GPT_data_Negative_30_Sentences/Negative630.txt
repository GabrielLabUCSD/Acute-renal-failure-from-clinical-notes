Postoperatively, the patient received appropriate anesthesia and was closely monitored throughout the surgical procedure. The surgeon performed the hernia repair using a mesh reinforcement technique. The surgery went smoothly without any unexpected events. 

Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where he tolerated the anesthesia well. His vital signs remained stable, and he reported minimal pain. The patient was encouraged to ambulate the day after surgery to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.
