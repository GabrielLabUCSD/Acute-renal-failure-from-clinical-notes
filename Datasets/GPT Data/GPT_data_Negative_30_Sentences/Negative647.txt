The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
He has a BMI of 30, indicating mild obesity.
He presents with symptoms of chronic knee pain and difficulty walking, which have progressively worsened over the past year.
Conservative management with physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been unsuccessful.
Considering these factors, the decision has been made for the patient to undergo total knee replacement surgery.
The patient is otherwise in good overall health, with no other significant medical conditions.
He does not smoke and has no history of alcohol or drug abuse.
Preoperatively, routine laboratory tests were conducted, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, all of which were within normal limits.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, demonstrating normal sinus rhythm with no signs of ischemia.
He underwent a thorough pre-anesthetic evaluation and was deemed suitable for surgery without any concerns.
The patient was provided with appropriate instructions regarding fasting before the surgery and discontinued the use of anticoagulant medications in consultation with his primary care physician.
He arrived at the hospital on the scheduled day of surgery and was admitted to the preoperative holding area.
An anesthesiologist then administered general anesthesia, and the patient was brought to the operating room.
The surgical procedure for total knee replacement was carried out successfully with no intraoperative complications.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient received appropriate analgesics to manage pain and was closely monitored for any signs of bleeding or infection.
Vital signs were stable, and his pain was adequately controlled.
He underwent physical therapy sessions to initiate early mobilization and strengthen the new joint.
The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence.
He gradually regained his ambulatory function and was able to perform activities of daily living independently.
Routine postoperative radiographs showed proper alignment and positioning of the prosthesis.
The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with instructions for wound care, pain management, and rehabilitation exercises.
He was advised to follow up with his orthopedic surgeon for a wound check and suture removal in two weeks.
During the first follow-up visit, the wound was healing satisfactorily, and the patient reported minimal pain.
He was encouraged to continue physical therapy and instructed to avoid high-impact activities or excessive weight-bearing.
At subsequent visits, the patient continued to improve, demonstrating increased range of motion and decreased pain.
There were no signs of implant loosening or infection during the follow-up period.
In summary, a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent successful total knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. He had an uneventful recovery, with no wound-related issues or signs of infection. The patient gradually regained function and was discharged home on postoperative day three. He continued to improve during the follow-up period, showing no signs of implant failure or infection.
