The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. His medical history includes hypertension, high cholesterol, and a history of myocardial infarction four years ago. He has been on medications for these conditions, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a statin.

There is no history of any renal problems or kidney disease. He has a normal baseline renal function with a glomerular filtration rate of 80 mL/min/1.73m2. A recent complete blood count and liver function tests were also within normal limits.

Regarding his surgical history, he has had a cholecystectomy ten years ago due to gallstone disease. The surgery was uneventful, and he recovered well.

He had a thorough preoperative evaluation, including an echocardiogram, which showed normal left ventricular function without any valvular abnormalities. His cardiac enzymes were negative, and he had no evidence of ongoing myocardial ischemia.

The patient had a preoperative consultation with an anesthesiologist, who deemed him to be at low risk for any perioperative complications. His airway examination was normal, and he had good exercise tolerance.

In terms of his postoperative course, no major complications were noted. The patient was monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit and was transferred to the surgical ward the following day.

He was started on prophylactic antibiotics, which were continued for 48 hours. His pain was adequately managed with the use of a patient-controlled analgesia pump. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and ambulation to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay. His cardiac enzymes were monitored to rule out any perioperative myocardial infarction, and they remained within normal limits.

No signs of wound infection or surgical site complications were observed. The surgical incision healed well without any signs of dehiscence or drainage.

The patient's renal function was monitored closely, and his serum creatinine remained stable postoperatively. He was encouraged to maintain adequate hydration to prevent any potential renal complications.

He required a short-term course of low molecular weight heparin for venous thrombosis prophylaxis, which was well-tolerated.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day four with appropriate discharge instructions. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his chronic conditions and to remove staples or sutures if required.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any major complications during his postoperative course. His recovery was uneventful, and he did not show any signs of infection, thromboembolism, or cardiac complications.

Although acute renal failure was not observed, routine renal function tests indicated that his kidney function was unaffected postoperatively. Moreover, no other complications related to his previous medical history or surgical intervention were observed.
