The patient, who is planning to undergo surgery, has an extensive medical history that needs to be taken into account. They have a history of hypertension, which has been moderately controlled with medication. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2, which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents.

The patient has a past surgical history that includes a cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease and a bilateral knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis. Following the knee replacement, the patient experienced a surgical site infection, which was treated with antibiotics.

Other notable medical conditions in the patient's history include hyperlipidemia, for which they are taking statins, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), managed with proton pump inhibitors. They also have a history of chronic back pain due to degenerative disc disease and receive regular physical therapy for pain management.

In terms of allergies, the patient has a documented allergy to penicillin, which is crucial for the surgical team to be aware of while selecting appropriate antibiotics for perioperative prophylaxis.

On examination, the patient is found to be overweight with a BMI of 32. They have normal cardiovascular and respiratory examinations but display limited range of motion and pain in both knees on physical examination.

As part of the preoperative workup, the patient undergoes routine blood tests, including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation studies. The results reveal mild anemia with hemoglobin levels of 11.5 g/dL, normal electrolyte levels, and a slightly prolonged prothrombin time.

The patient is also scheduled for a preoperative chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram, both of which yield normal results. To further evaluate their cardiac health, the patient undergoes a stress test, which shows no significant abnormalities.

Due to the patient's moderate hypertension and diabetes, a consult with their primary care physician is recommended to optimize their control of these conditions prior to surgery. The patient's primary care physician adjusts their antihypertensive and hypoglycemic medications accordingly.

In terms of the surgical procedure, it is essential to note that all precautions are taken to prevent any potential postoperative complications. The patient is intubated under general anesthesia, and the surgical team follows strict aseptic techniques to reduce the risk of surgical site infections.

During the operation, the patient receives appropriate perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with a non-penicillin-based antibiotic. The surgery itself proceeds without any complications, and the patient is transferred to the recovery room for postoperative monitoring.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experiences mild pain, which is effectively managed with analgesic medications. They are encouraged to mobilize as soon as possible to prevent the formation of blood clots in their lower extremities.

The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are closely monitored for any signs of infection or other complications. The surgical site is examined regularly for signs of swelling, redness, or discharge.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain decreases, and their functional ability improves. Physical therapy is initiated to aid in their recovery, with a focus on regaining strength and range of motion in their affected joints.

During the postoperative course, the patient develops a urinary tract infection, which is promptly identified through routine monitoring of urine tests. They are commenced on appropriate antibiotics, and their symptoms resolve without further complications.

In the weeks following the surgery, the patient continues to progress well, with rehabilitation efforts targeting their specific needs. Physical therapy sessions are increased in frequency to optimize their recovery.

After a month, the patient demonstrates significant improvement in pain relief, mobility, and functional independence. They are discharged from the hospital with instructions to continue outpatient physical therapy and to follow up with their primary care physician.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was generally smooth, except for the development of a urinary tract infection, which was treated promptly and resolved without further complications.
