The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been taking medications to manage both conditions for the past 10 years. The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled on his current regimen of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. His diabetes has been managed with metformin and diet modifications, and his recent A1C was 6.5%.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of mild osteoarthritis in both knees, which has caused some pain and limited mobility. He has been managing this with physical therapy and over-the-counter pain medications. However, due to the worsening pain and functional limitations, the patient has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's preoperative workup included an EKG, chest X-ray, and complete blood count. All of these tests were within normal limits. His renal function was assessed through serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, which were both within normal ranges, indicating no signs of acute renal failure.

The patient underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia without any immediate intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he was started on intravenous antibiotics and pain medications to manage his pain. Physical therapy was also initiated on the day of surgery to help with movement and to prevent blood clots.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not develop any signs of infection or wound complications. His pain was well controlled with the prescribed analgesics, and the incision site was monitored for any signs of redness, swelling, or discharge. He was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker as tolerated and started experiencing gradual improvement in knee function.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was discharged home with a prescription for oral pain medications and a referral for outpatient physical therapy. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for wound evaluation and suture removal.

During the postoperative course, the patient did not experience any complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He diligently attended his outpatient physical therapy sessions and reported gradual improvement in knee mobility and decreased pain.

At the follow-up appointment, the patient's wound was healing well, and the sutures were removed without any issues. He was encouraged to continue with physical therapy and maintain a healthy lifestyle to optimize his recovery.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course after total knee replacement surgery with no complications other than acute renal failure. The patient's hypertension and diabetes were well managed during the perioperative period, and his renal function remained normal throughout the process. He continues to make steady progress in his recovery and is expected to regain full mobility and function in his knee with time and ongoing therapy.
