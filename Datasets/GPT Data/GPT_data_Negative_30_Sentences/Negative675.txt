Patient X, a 60-year-old male, with a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis, is scheduled for surgery. He has a history of smoking for 40 years but quit 10 years ago. His current medications include lisinopril for hypertension and atorvastatin for dyslipidemia.

The patient underwent an extensive preoperative evaluation, including a chest X-ray, EKG, and laboratory tests. The chest X-ray revealed clear lung fields, while the EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. Laboratory results were within normal limits, including a normal complete blood count, metabolic panel, and coagulation profile.

During his preoperative evaluation, the patient was found to have well-controlled hypertension, with a blood pressure consistently below 130/80 mmHg. He had no other significant cardiac history or symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease. His lipid profile was also well-controlled, with LDL cholesterol levels consistently below 100 mg/dL.

However, the patient did express concerns about his osteoarthritis impacting his mobility and recovery post-surgery. He had previously undergone conservative management for osteoarthritis, including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The patient was informed about the surgical procedure, including possible complications such as infection, bleeding, or wound complications. He was also counseled about the importance of smoking cessation, which he agreed to continue despite having quit a decade ago.

Following surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was monitored closely for any signs of infection or complications, such as fever, wound drainage, or increased pain. He received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and was encouraged to ambulate early to prevent postoperative complications like deep vein thrombosis.

The patient experienced mild postoperative pain, which was managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. He was also referred to physical therapy to help address his osteoarthritis symptoms and improve mobility.

During the postoperative follow-up visits, the patient's surgical incision was noted to be healing well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. His pain gradually improved, and he had full range of motion in the affected joint.

In terms of the surgical outcome, the patient achieved the intended goals of the surgery, leading to improved joint function and reduced pain. However, he did develop a superficial wound infection at the surgical site, which was managed with wound care and a short course of oral antibiotics.

The patient remained compliant with his postoperative care instructions, including regular physical therapy sessions and continued smoking cessation. He also attended follow-up visits as scheduled, allowing for close monitoring of his progress and prompt management of any concerns.

Overall, despite the transient wound infection, the patient's postoperative course was successful, with a favorable outcome in terms of the surgical goals of pain relief and improved joint function. It is recommended that the patient continues his regular follow-up visits to ensure long-term success and address any ongoing concerns related to osteoarthritis management.
