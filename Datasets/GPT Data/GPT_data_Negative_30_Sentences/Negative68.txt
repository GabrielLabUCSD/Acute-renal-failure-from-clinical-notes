The patient is a 62-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He is overweight with a body mass index of 31.3 and has a history of smoking for 20 years.

His hypertension is currently well controlled on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. His diabetes is managed with metformin, and his most recent glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 6.5%. He takes a statin for his hyperlipidemia, and his lipid profile is within normal limits.

The patient's coronary artery disease is managed with aspirin and atorvastatin. He had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 10 years ago and has been asymptomatic since then. His last stress test, performed 1 year ago, showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. He is also taking clopidogrel for one year following drug-eluting stent placement in his right coronary artery.

His surgical history includes a cholecystectomy 5 years ago due to cholelithiasis. He recovered uneventfully from the surgery and has had no complications related to it.

The patient is currently not on any medications that need to be discontinued prior to surgery. He does not have any known allergies to medications or latex.

He denies any symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema. His exercise tolerance is fair, as he is able to walk about 3 miles without experiencing any symptoms.

The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, with a hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 42%, platelet count of 200,000/µL, and a white blood cell count of 8,000/µL. His serum electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and renal function tests are all normal.

His preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) shows normal sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave abnormalities. There are no Q waves or signs of myocardial infarction.

The patient has been advised to continue taking his home medications up until the day of surgery with a sip of water.

The patient has been counseled on the importance of smoking cessation and has expressed a desire to quit smoking prior to surgery.

He has been referred to a nutritionist for counseling on weight loss, as he would benefit from losing weight prior to surgery to reduce surgical risks.

The patient has undergone a preoperative assessment by an anesthesiologist, who has reviewed his medical history and noted no contraindications to anesthesia. The anesthesiologist has recommended general anesthesia for the surgery.

Following surgery, the patient will be closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for any complications. Pain management will be provided using a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.

He will be started on prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively to prevent surgical site infections.

The patient will be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible after surgery to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, will be regularly monitored in the PACU and postoperative period.

The patient will receive deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with sequential compression devices on both lower extremities during the surgery and throughout his hospital stay.

He will be started on a clear liquid diet on the day of surgery and advanced to regular diet as tolerated.

The patient's surgical wound will be inspected for signs of infection and proper healing during his hospitalization.

It is important for the patient to continue taking his home medications, including antiplatelet therapy, after surgery to prevent complications.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications noted.

He recovered well from surgery and was able to ambulate without difficulty.

The patient's pain was effectively managed with the PCA pump, and he experienced no adverse reactions to the medications.

There were no signs of surgical site infections or wound dehiscence.

The patient's laboratory values remained within normal limits throughout his hospital stay.

He was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with instructions for wound care, medications, and follow-up appointments.
