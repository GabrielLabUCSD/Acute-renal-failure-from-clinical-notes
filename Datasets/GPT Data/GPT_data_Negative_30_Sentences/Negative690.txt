The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He is planning to undergo elective surgery for gallbladder removal due to the presence of multiple gallstones. His preoperative workup included a complete blood count, liver function tests, and an abdominal ultrasound to assess the stone burden. Echocardiogram and stress test were also performed, showing no significant cardiac abnormalities.

The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled on lisinopril 20 mg daily, and his blood glucose levels are managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He has previously had a successful cholecystectomy and hernia repair without complications. He denies any known drug allergies.

During the surgical procedure, general anesthesia was administered, and intraoperative findings revealed a moderately distended gallbladder with multiple gallstones. The surgery was completed laparoscopically without any complications, and a cholecystectomy was successfully performed.

In the postoperative period, the patient experienced mild pain at the surgical site, which was effectively managed with oral analgesics. He was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. The patient's vital signs remained stable, with no noticeable postoperative bleeding or signs of infection.

Within the first 48 hours, the patient was ambulating well and felt comfortable. He was able to pass flatus, and bowel movements resumed. The surgical incisions were healing satisfactorily without any signs of wound infection or dehiscence. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day with instructions for wound care and a follow-up visit in two weeks.

During the follow-up visit, the patient reported feeling much better since his surgery. The surgical wounds were fully healed with no signs of infection. His postoperative pain had resolved completely, and he had returned to his normal activities of daily living. The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained well controlled.

There were no identified complications during the patient's postoperative course. He did not experience any significant bleeding, wound infections, or respiratory difficulties. The patient's renal function remained stable without any signs of acute renal failure.

Overall, the patient had a smooth postoperative course following his cholecystectomy. The surgery successfully addressed his gallbladder pathology, and he experienced a quick recovery without complications. The patient's hypertension and diabetes were effectively managed throughout the perioperative period, contributing to his favorable outcome.
