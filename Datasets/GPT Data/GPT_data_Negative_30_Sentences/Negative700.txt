The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an undisclosed condition. His medical history includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which are well-controlled with medications. He has a history of smoking for 15 years but quit five years ago and has not had any respiratory symptoms since then.

In terms of surgeries, the patient had an appendectomy in his teenage years and an elective orthopedic procedure on his knee five years ago, which was uneventful. He has a history of allergies to penicillin and has been labeled as penicillin-allergic in his medical records. The rest of his surgical history is unremarkable.

The patient's preoperative evaluation includes routine blood tests, which revealed normal kidney function, liver function, and hematological parameters. His electrocardiogram showed no signs of underlying cardiac abnormalities. Chest X-ray was also clear, ruling out any overt lung pathology. Pulmonary function tests were not performed due to the patient's prior history of smoking but as he remains asymptomatic, it was deemed unnecessary.

During the perioperative period, the patient will be under general anesthesia, and his blood pressure and heart rate will be continuously monitored. Antibiotic prophylaxis will be tailored according to his penicillin-allergic status. Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis will also be implemented using low molecular weight heparin injections.

Postoperatively, the patient will be monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, or respiratory compromise. Pain management will be achieved using a multimodal approach, including intravenous opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if not contraindicated. Physical therapy will be started early to aid in mobilization.

Complications can arise after any surgery, but the patient is generally low-risk given his well-controlled medical conditions and good overall health. However, potential postoperative complications may include wound infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or deep vein thrombosis. The patient will be educated on the signs and symptoms of these complications and encouraged to report any concerns promptly to his healthcare team.

As for acute renal failure, the patient has no known underlying renal dysfunction or risk factors for renal complications. Therefore, the risk of developing acute renal failure specifically is considered minimal.

In conclusion, this 45-year-old male patient with controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is scheduled for surgery with an unremarkable surgical history. Preoperatively, his laboratory results and cardiac evaluations are within normal limits. Postoperatively, he will be closely monitored for potential complications such as infection, bleeding, or respiratory compromise. The patient's risk for acute renal failure specifically is low.
