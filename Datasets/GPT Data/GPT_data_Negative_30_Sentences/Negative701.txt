The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years and is a current smoker. The patient reports occasional dyspnea on exertion, but denies any chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. He has a sedentary lifestyle and his exercise tolerance is limited due to his smoking habit.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient previously underwent a cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis 10 years ago without any complications. He has no known allergies to medications or latex. Laboratory investigations revealed a fasting blood sugar level of 170 mg/dL, total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein of 150 mg/dL, and a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg.

The patient was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and cardiologist. Preoperative testing included an electrocardiogram, which showed no acute changes, and a transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed preserved left ventricular systolic function with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. His estimated glomerular filtration rate was 65 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating mild impairment.

Given the patient's medical history and risk factors, a preoperative smoking cessation counseling was initiated. He was instructed to quit smoking at least 4 weeks prior to surgery to reduce perioperative complications. The patient was started on a beta-blocker and statin therapy to optimize his cardiovascular status. In addition, his glycemic control was addressed through a modification in his antidiabetic medications.

On the day of surgery, the patient was administered perioperative antibiotics to minimize the risk of surgical site infection. A comprehensive intraoperative and postoperative pain management plan was established to ensure adequate pain control. The procedure itself (type not specified) was performed without any intraoperative complications, and the patient's vital signs remained stable throughout.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room and received intravenous fluids and analgesics as required. He was started on deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, and early ambulation to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications. The patient tolerated a regular diet without any gastrointestinal issues, and his postoperative labs showed no significant abnormalities.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain gradually improved with oral pain medication, and he reported better overall comfort. Wound healing progressed without any signs of infection or dehiscence. Daily physiotherapy sessions were initiated to help regain strength and mobility. A multidisciplinary team continued to monitor the patient's recovery progress, managing and documenting his pain levels, medication administration, wound care, and respiratory function.

During his hospital stay, the patient did not experience any significant adverse events or complications such as surgical site infections, cardiac events, or deep vein thrombosis. His blood glucose levels were well-controlled with sliding-scale insulin. The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively, with no signs of acute kidney injury.

As the patient was recovering well and meeting the established discharge criteria, he was discharged on postoperative day 4. Detailed discharge instructions were provided, including wound care, medication regimen, and recommendations for follow-up care with his primary care provider. The patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and was advised to continue smoking cessation efforts to optimize his long-term health.
