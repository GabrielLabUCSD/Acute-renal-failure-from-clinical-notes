The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. His blood pressure is well controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. He takes metformin for his diabetes and atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia. The patient denies any previous surgeries.

His surgical procedure is to be performed under general anesthesia, and he was advised to stop taking his metformin 24 hours prior to surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis. His preoperative laboratory results show a fasting glucose level of 120 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 7%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 110 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. He was counseled extensively on the detrimental effects of smoking on wound healing and postoperative complications, and he expressed a strong desire to quit smoking. He has been referred to a smoking cessation program for further guidance and support.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient was found to have mild obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m². He underwent a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, which revealed no significant abnormalities. His cardiac function was normal, with an ejection fraction of 60%.

The patient was evaluated by an anesthesiologist who deemed him fit for surgery. He was instructed to stop eating and drinking at least 8 hours before the scheduled procedure to minimize the risk of aspiration. He was also advised to refrain from any strenuous activities or heavy lifting during the postoperative recovery period.

Following the surgery, the patient had an uneventful immediate postoperative course. He was monitored in the recovery room for several hours, during which his vital signs remained stable. He was prescribed opioid analgesics for pain control, and his pain was well managed throughout the postoperative period.

The patient’s postoperative laboratory results showed a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 12,000/μL, which was believed to be a normal response to the surgical stress and inflammation. His electrolyte levels, including calcium, potassium, and magnesium, were within normal limits.

He remained on intravenous fluids for the first 24 hours after the surgery to maintain fluid balance and prevent dehydration. His urine output was monitored closely, which remained within normal limits throughout his hospital stay. The patient was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

On postoperative day 2, the patient complained of mild surgical site pain and was started on oral analgesics. His incision appeared to be healing well, with no signs of erythema, swelling, or drainage. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet and there were no issues with bowel movements or gastrointestinal function.

The patient’s blood glucose levels were monitored regularly, and oral hypoglycemic medications were adjusted as necessary to maintain glycemic control. His fasting glucose levels ranged from 100 to 140 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin A1c remained stable around 7%.

The patient received appropriate prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis with subcutaneous heparin injections and sequential compression devices on both lower extremities. He was also placed on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections, which were continued for 24 hours after surgery.

Overall, the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 3. He was instructed to continue his regular medications, including lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and atorvastatin. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further evaluation and management of his chronic conditions.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any significant postoperative complications such as wound infection, respiratory compromise, or cardiovascular events. However, it is important to note that acute renal failure was not observed during the postoperative period.

The patient was encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, smoking cessation, and adherence to a nutritious diet to optimize his long-term health outcomes. He was educated on the importance of regular follow-up visits and compliance with his medication regimen to prevent disease progression and future surgical interventions.
