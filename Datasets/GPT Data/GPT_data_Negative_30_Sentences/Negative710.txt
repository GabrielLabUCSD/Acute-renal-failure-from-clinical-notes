The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has been on medications to control both conditions for the past five years.

His blood pressure has been well-controlled on a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. His HbA1c levels have also been within the target range with oral hypoglycemic agents.

He had an episode of myocardial infarction five years ago and subsequently underwent coronary angioplasty with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. He has been asymptomatic since then and exercises regularly without any limitations.

A recent echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular function with no evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities. His electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T changes.

Apart from his cardiovascular history, he has a past surgical history of cholecystectomy performed ten years ago due to acute cholecystitis. The surgery was uncomplicated, and he had an uneventful recovery.

His pre-operative laboratory investigations are within normal limits. His complete blood count, liver function tests, renal profile, and coagulation profile are all within normal ranges.

He denies any history of tobacco, alcohol, or substance abuse. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally in moderation. He has no known drug allergies.

In terms of family history, his parents had hypertension, but no other significant cardiac or metabolic conditions. He has three siblings, all of whom are healthy.

The patient has been counseled about the surgical procedure, and the risks and benefits have been explained to him in detail. He understands the need for surgery and has provided informed consent.

He will be undergoing an elective surgery under general anesthesia. Pre-operative instructions have been given, including fasting for six hours prior to the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for potential complications such as bleeding, infection, or respiratory compromise. Pain management will be provided as per protocol.

Early ambulation and deep breathing exercises will be encouraged to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis.

His blood pressure and blood glucose levels will be closely monitored in the postoperative period. His regular antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications will be resumed as soon as feasible.

The patient will be discharged once he is stable, afebrile, able to tolerate oral intake, and his pain is well-controlled. He will be provided with appropriate discharge instructions and prescriptions for postoperative pain control.

In terms of complications, it is important to note that acute renal failure is not expected based on his medical history and preoperative investigations. However, as with any surgical procedure, there is always a risk of general complications such as infection, bleeding, or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

Based on the provided information, no specific mention of postoperative complications is noted in the patient's history. However, the potential for complications always exists and will be closely monitored and managed postoperatively to ensure timely intervention if required.

Overall, the patient has a well-controlled medical history with appropriate management of hypertension and diabetes. He has a stable cardiovascular status and has successfully undergone a previous surgery without complications. With proper preoperative preparation and close postoperative monitoring, the patient is expected to have a smooth recovery.
