The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with worsening right hip pain and stiffness. He has a past medical history significant for osteoarthritis and obesity. The patient has tried conservative measures such as physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications but to no avail. After discussing his options, he has decided to undergo total hip replacement surgery to alleviate his symptoms. 

His preoperative workup included a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, which were all within normal limits. Additionally, an electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were obtained and showed no significant abnormalities. The patient was cleared for surgery by both the orthopedic surgeon and the anesthesiologist.

During the surgical procedure, the patient was placed under general anesthesia. A posterior approach was utilized, and a cementless hip prosthesis was successfully implanted. The surgery was uncomplicated, with an estimated blood loss of 250 mL. The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for signs of infection, thrombosis, or other complications. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics and received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with mechanical compression devices. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization.

The patient's pain was managed with a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He was also provided with patient-controlled analgesia for self-administration of pain medication. The patient reported good pain control throughout his hospital stay.

His postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any immediate complications such as wound infection or surgical site bleeding. X-rays taken prior to discharge showed proper prosthetic alignment. The patient was instructed on hip precautions and given a list of activities to avoid during the recovery period.

On discharge, the patient was prescribed oral analgesics, including a short course of opioids for breakthrough pain. He was advised to continue physical therapy on an outpatient basis to facilitate rehabilitation. The patient was also instructed to be vigilant for signs of infection, such as increasing pain, redness, or drainage, and to follow up with his orthopedic surgeon in two weeks for a wound check.

Overall, the patient tolerated the surgery well and had an excellent postoperative course. His pain was adequately controlled, and he did not experience any complications related to the surgery. The patient's physical therapy and rehabilitation were progressing as expected, and he showed signs of improvement in his hip function. With appropriate follow-up and adherence to rehabilitation plans, the patient is expected to have a successful recovery and improved quality of life.
