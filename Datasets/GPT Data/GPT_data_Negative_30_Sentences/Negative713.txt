The patient is a 62-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a gallbladder removal. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with Lisinopril, and he takes Atorvastatin for his cholesterol and Metformin for his diabetes.

He has no known drug allergies and is a non-smoker. The patient has had a previous cholecystectomy about 10 years ago and has had no issues since then. His last general medical check-up was six months ago and all his routine blood work, including liver and kidney function tests, were within normal limits.

The patient reports occasional mild abdominal discomfort and bloating, which has prompted this surgery. His primary care physician referred him to a surgeon who recommended the procedure as a potential improvement in his symptoms.

He has been informed about the potential risks and benefits of the surgery, including bleeding, infection, and injury to surrounding organs. The patient does not have any known risk factors that would increase his likelihood of complications.

The patient is currently on a regular diet and does not take any over-the-counter medications regularly. He walks for exercise three times a week but does not participate in any other strenuous physical activities. He lives alone but has family nearby to assist him during his recovery period.

The patient has been instructed to stop taking any aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a week prior to surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding. He has also been advised to fast starting at midnight the night before the procedure.

The surgical team has requested pre-operative investigations including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and liver function tests. An electrocardiogram and chest X-ray have also been ordered, since the patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

During surgery, the patient will be placed under general anesthesia, and the procedure is expected to last around 1 hour. The surgeon will use laparoscopic techniques to remove the gallbladder. Post-operatively, the patient will be monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of bleeding or infection.

He will be given pain medication to manage any discomfort and will be encouraged to start ambulating as soon as possible. The patient will also receive detailed instructions on wound care and how to recognize any signs of surgical site infection.

The patient is expected to have a short hospital stay of about one to two days, and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled for one week after discharge. During the follow-up visit, the surgeon will assess the incision site and make sure that the patient's recovery is progressing well.

Complications specific to the surgery include bleeding, infection, and injury to surrounding organs, but the patient has been deemed to have a low risk based on his medical history. There are no indications that his postoperative course will be complicated, and he is encouraged to contact his surgeon if he experiences any unexpected symptoms or concerns during his recovery.
