The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with chronic pain in his right knee, which has significantly affected his ability to walk and perform daily activities. His medical history is significant for osteoarthritis of the knee, which was diagnosed five years ago, and he has been managing the pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy.

Despite conservative management, the patient's knee pain has progressively worsened, prompting the decision to undergo surgery. Prior to surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, including laboratory tests, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray, which all revealed no significant abnormalities. He has no history of cardiovascular disease or significant comorbidities that would increase the surgical risk.

The patient's surgical procedure will involve a total knee arthroplasty to replace the damaged joint with an artificial one. This procedure is commonly performed to alleviate pain and improve knee function in patients with severe osteoarthritis. The patient was thoroughly educated about the surgical procedure, risks, benefits, and the expected postoperative recovery period. He provided informed consent for the surgery.

Following the successful surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He was closely monitored in the recovery room and subsequently transferred to the orthopedic ward. Pain management was addressed with a multimodal approach, including intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and scheduled non-opioid medications. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to maximize joint mobilization and early ambulation.

To prevent complications, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was administered, consisting of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression devices. Antibiotic prophylaxis was also provided to prevent surgical site infections. Wound care was regularly assessed, and there were no signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient made steady progress in his physical therapy, achieving adequate active range of motion and ambulation with the assistive device by the third postoperative day. He was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day in a stable condition. He was prescribed oral analgesics and advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient.

During the follow-up visit at two weeks after surgery, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and functional mobility. His surgical incision was well healed with no signs of infection. Range of motion had further improved, and he was able to walk longer distances without aids. He was advised to continue physical therapy and gradually progress to more demanding activities.

At the six-week follow-up appointment, the patient's rehabilitation progress was satisfactory. His knee function continued to improve, and he was able to return to light work duties. The surgical incision was barely visible and no longer tender. X-rays were obtained to confirm proper positioning and stability of the implanted device, which appeared satisfactory, indicating successful knee replacement surgery.

Overall, the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course, making significant improvements in pain relief and functional ability following total knee arthroplasty. The surgery effectively addressed his longstanding knee osteoarthritis, restoring his quality of life and enabling him to resume daily activities with minimal restrictions.
