The patient is a 58-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery. He has a complex medical history including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease and had a myocardial infarction two years ago.

He had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting surgery at that time. The patient currently takes multiple medications including metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin to manage his medical conditions.

In addition to his cardiovascular history, the patient has a history of osteoarthritis in his knees and has undergone arthroscopic surgery on both knees a few years ago. He regularly takes over-the-counter NSAIDs for pain relief.

The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is on tiotropium inhaler and uses albuterol inhaler as needed for symptom control. He has occasional exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, which have been tapered off recently.

Furthermore, the patient has a known allergy to penicillin and experiences a rash when taking it. He does not smoke and rarely consumes alcohol.

In terms of surgical-related complications, the patient has a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). He does not have a personal history of either condition.

During the preoperative period, the patient underwent routine preoperative testing including bloodwork, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a chest X-ray. These tests showed no significant abnormalities.

The patient was seen by the anesthesiologist, who determined that he was at moderate risk for perioperative complications based on his medical history. The patient was advised to continue taking his medications, with the exception of metformin, which was stopped 24 hours before surgery.

The surgery went smoothly, and the patient was successfully extubated in the recovery room. He was then transferred to the surgical floor for postoperative care. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was able to tolerate a regular diet within 24 hours of surgery.

Pain management was achieved with a combination of intravenous opioids and oral NSAIDs. The patient ambulated with assistance on the first postoperative day and was gradually transitioned to independent ambulation.

He experienced some mild postoperative swelling and discomfort in his knees, which was managed with ice packs and elevation. Physical therapy was initiated to help improve his mobility and strength.

The patient did not develop any signs or symptoms of DVT or PE during his hospital stay. Sequential compression devices were utilized as a preventative measure for venous thromboembolism.

On assessment, the patient had stable vital signs and appropriate wound healing. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and his diabetes was well-controlled with sliding-scale insulin.

Overall, the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day four with instructions for wound care, pain management, and glucose monitoring.

A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks after discharge to monitor the patient's progress. On follow-up, the patient reported improved knee pain and mobility.

In summary, the 58-year-old male patient with a complex medical history underwent surgery without complications. His medical history included diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and COPD. He had a previous myocardial infarction and arthroscopic knee surgery. The patient had no significant abnormal findings during preoperative testing. His postoperative course was uneventful with appropriate pain management. He did not develop any DVT or PE during his hospital stay. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with scheduled follow-up.
