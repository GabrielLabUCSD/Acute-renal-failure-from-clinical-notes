However, he does have mild dyslipidemia with a total cholesterol of 230 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 160 mg/dL. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 85 mL/min/1.73m2, suggesting normal kidney function.

The patient is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse. He maintains a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and follows a balanced diet. He has a supportive family who can provide assistance during his postoperative recovery period.

During the surgery, the patient was closely monitored and anesthetized without complications. The procedure went well, lasting approximately two hours.
