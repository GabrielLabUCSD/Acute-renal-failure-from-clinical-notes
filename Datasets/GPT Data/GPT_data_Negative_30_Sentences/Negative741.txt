The patient is a 58-year-old male with a significant medical history planning to undergo surgery. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently on medications including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin for the management of these conditions.

In addition, the patient has a known history of coronary artery disease and had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention two years ago, receiving two drug-eluting stents in the right coronary artery. He is currently asymptomatic with no active cardiac issues.

The patient also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a CPAP machine at night for optimal oxygenation. He states compliance with the treatment and reports no difficulties with its use.

Furthermore, the patient has a past surgical history notable for a cholecystectomy performed five years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. No complications were reported during or after the surgery.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable, and his general appearance is consistent with his age. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and there are no abnormal findings upon abdominal examination.

Laboratory results show a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, total cholesterol of 210 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 130 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 180 mg/dL. His renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

Preoperative electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes. An echocardiogram performed three months ago demonstrated preserved left ventricular systolic function with no valvular abnormalities.

The patient has been extensively counseled about the surgery, including risks, benefits, and alternatives. He understands the need for anesthesia and has provided informed consent. The surgical team has been informed of his medical history, and appropriate interventions, such as stress-dose steroids, will be administered as needed during the procedure.

Following the surgery, the patient is expected to undergo routine postoperative care in the surgical ward. He will be monitored closely for any signs of infection, respiratory compromise, or cardiac complications. Nurses will perform regular vital sign checks and evaluate wound healing.

To prevent deep vein thrombosis, the patient will receive prophylactic low molecular weight heparin, pneumatic compression stockings, and early mobilization. Pain control will be managed with a multimodal approach involving opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient has been educated about postoperative pain management and the importance of early ambulation.

As for potential complications, acute renal failure is not anticipated based on the patient's normal renal function. However, other common postoperative complications such as surgical site infection, urinary tract infection, atelectasis, pneumonia, or venous thromboembolism may occur. Early identification and prompt treatment will be crucial in optimizing the patient's recovery.

In conclusion, the patient is a 58-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status-post percutaneous coronary intervention, and obstructive sleep apnea. He has undergone a previous cholecystectomy without complications. The patient is planned for surgery and postoperative care will include monitoring for potential complications and interventions to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis. Acute renal failure is not expected based on his normal renal function.
