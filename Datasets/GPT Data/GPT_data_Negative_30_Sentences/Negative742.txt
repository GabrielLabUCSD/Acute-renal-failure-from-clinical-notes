Patient X is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. 

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with a combination of amlodipine and lisinopril. He has been compliant with his antihypertensive medication regimen and has no reported episodes of uncontrolled blood pressure. 

Patient X has diabetes mellitus type 2 and manages it with metformin and glipizide. His most recent HbA1c level was 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control. He has not experienced any hypoglycemic episodes lately. 

Due to his hyperlipidemia, the patient takes atorvastatin to manage his cholesterol levels. His most recent lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 190 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 120 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 150 mg/dL. 

Patient X's surgery is scheduled for next week. He is otherwise asymptomatic and has no known drug allergies. He does not smoke and consumes alcohol occasionally. His BMI is within a normal range at 25. 

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6Â°F. His physical examination did not reveal any significant abnormalities. 

Lab results prior to surgery showed a hemoglobin level of 14 g/dL, a hematocrit of 42%, and a platelet count of 200,000/uL. His renal function, liver function, and coagulation profile were within normal limits. 

Patient X consulted with an anesthesiologist who determined that he is suitable for general anesthesia. Echo-cardiography revealed no structural abnormalities or signs of cardiac dysfunction. The patient's ejection fraction was calculated to be 60%.

Continuation of antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications was advised until the morning of surgery, with the exception of metformin which was withheld due to the risk of lactic acidosis. 

Patient X underwent surgery under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The hernia repair was successful, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. 

Postoperatively, the patient was assessed in the recovery room and later transferred to the surgical ward. Vital signs remained stable, and no signs of infection or bleeding were observed. 

The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform activities of daily living as tolerated. 

His pain was well-controlled with a combination of acetaminophen and low-dose opioids. 

Patient X's surgical wound was assessed regularly, and no signs of infection or dehiscence were noted. 

Stool softeners were added to prevent constipation, and the patient was advised to increase fluid intake and consume a high-fiber diet. 

The patient's blood glucose levels were monitored closely to ensure stable glycemic control. 

Patient X started a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. 

He remained in the hospital for three days without any complications. 

On the second postoperative day, he was seen by a physical therapist to initiate a rehabilitation program. 

The patient's ambulation and range of motion exercises progressed well, and he was able to perform activities independently. 

His pain level decreased over time, and he was transitioned to oral analgesics. 

Patient X was discharged home on the third postoperative day with instructions for wound care and continued activity as tolerated. 

He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a postoperative check-up. 

No immediate postoperative complications were reported, such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia. 

Patient X recovered well at home, and there were no signs of wound dehiscence or infection during his follow-up visit. 

He reported minimal pain at the surgical site and was able to resume his usual daily activities. 

At a one month follow-up visit, the patient reported complete resolution of his hernia-related symptoms and was satisfied with the surgical outcome. 

In summary, Patient X, a 56-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia, underwent uneventful hernia repair surgery. He had a smooth postoperative course without any significant complications and achieved successful resolution of hernia-related symptoms.
