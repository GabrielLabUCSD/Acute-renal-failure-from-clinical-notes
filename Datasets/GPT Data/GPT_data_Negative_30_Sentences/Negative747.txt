The patient is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has a BMI of 32. 

In terms of his hypertension, the patient has been on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for the past 5 years, with his blood pressure being well controlled. He does not have any history of hypertensive emergencies or end-organ damage.

Regarding his diabetes, the patient was diagnosed 10 years ago and has been on metformin and glipizide, along with lifestyle modifications. His latest HbA1c level was 7.0%, indicating fair glycemic control. He has not experienced any episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemic events.

The patient's peripheral vascular disease is characterized by intermittent claudication and reduced blood flow to his lower extremities. He has been prescribed aspirin and cilostazol to improve his symptoms. He denies any history of critical limb ischemia, ulcerations, or gangrene.

The patient's smoking history is significant, as it increases his risk for various complications, including impaired wound healing, pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis. Smoking cessation counseling has been offered to the patient in the past, but he has been unable to quit.

In terms of his surgical plan, the patient is scheduled for an elective procedure to address his peripheral vascular disease. The type of operation will depend on the extent and severity of his arterial occlusion. Preoperative imaging, such as angiography, will determine the appropriate intervention, including endovascular or open surgical options.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored for signs of wound infection, thromboembolic events, and respiratory complications. Prophylactic measures, such as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and perioperative antibiotics, will be implemented to minimize these risks. The patient's smoking status will also be addressed during his hospital stay.

Complications that may arise postoperatively include wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, infection, or delayed wound healing. The patient's history of smoking and diabetes further increases his risk for these complications. Adequate glycemic control and strict adherence to wound care will be crucial in preventing adverse outcomes.

It is important to note that acute renal failure is not listed as a potential complication for this patient. However, routine monitoring of renal function will be performed postoperatively, as the patient's medical history includes hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for renal impairment.

In conclusion, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and smoking. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for his peripheral vascular disease, with the type of intervention depending on preoperative imaging findings. Postoperatively, the patient will be at risk for complications such as wound infection and delayed healing due to his smoking history and diabetes. Appropriate measures will be taken to minimize these risks, and routine renal function monitoring will be performed.
