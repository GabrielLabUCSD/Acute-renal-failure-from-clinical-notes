The patient's medical history includes various conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis of the knees. They also have a history of smoking for 10 years and stopped 5 years ago. The patient's vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are stable. Their laboratory results reveal well-controlled blood sugar levels with an HbA1c of 6.2%. They have a normal lipid profile with LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dL. However, their blood pressure is slightly elevated, requiring medication to manage hypertension.

The patient reports intermittent knee pain, which has progressively worsened over the years. Conservative treatments including physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and joint injections have been ineffective. X-rays show moderate osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. The patient's BMI is 31, indicating they are overweight.

Due to the debilitating knee pain affecting their quality of life, the patient has opted for surgery. They are scheduled for total knee replacement (TKR) next month. The orthopedic surgeon has discussed the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for infection, blood clots, and postoperative pain. The patient has given informed consent.

Prior to surgery, the patient will undergo preoperative evaluations and testing, including a complete blood count, coagulation panel, and metabolic panel. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray will also be performed to assess cardiac and pulmonary function. The patient will be advised to stop taking certain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and blood thinners in the days leading up to surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient will be monitored in the recovery room for any complications such as pain, respiratory distress, or bleeding. They will receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics to prevent infection. Pain management will be provided through a combination of oral analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia, ensuring their comfort while promoting mobility.

Physical therapy will commence shortly after surgery, focusing on knee range of motion exercises and strengthening. The patient will be encouraged to ambulate with assistive devices initially and progress towards independent walking as tolerated. Occupational therapy will also be involved to assist with activities of daily living.

The patient will be discharged once their pain is adequately controlled, they are stable, and have demonstrated the ability to perform necessary activities. They will be provided with detailed instructions on wound care, medication administration, and self-management techniques. Outpatient physical therapy will be arranged to facilitate optimal functional recovery.

Complications can occur after TKR, including infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and persistent pain. The patient will receive prophylactic antibiotics, mechanical compression devices, and anticoagulation therapy to minimize these risks. Additionally, measures such as strict sterile technique during surgery and proper wound care are implemented to prevent infection.

Upon postoperative follow-up, the patient will be assessed for the resolution of pain, improved knee function, and signs of infection. They will continue with physical therapy and may require ongoing pain management, as well as further evaluation for residual symptoms or complications.

It is worth noting that the patient did not experience any notable complications during their postoperative course. They successfully managed their pain and achieved satisfactory knee function following the surgery. Rehabilitation progressed well, and the patient demonstrated good adherence to their postoperative instructions. The absence of complications is a positive outcome in the patient's overall recovery process.
