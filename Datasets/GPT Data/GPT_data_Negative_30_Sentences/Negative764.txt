The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. He has been on antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years and has been managing his blood pressure well. The patient has been struggling with pain and limited mobility due to the osteoarthritis in his left knee for the past five years. Various conservative treatments including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been unsuccessful, leading the patient to consider surgery.

He has a past surgical history of coronary artery bypass grafting performed six years ago, which was complicated by a minor wound infection that resolved with antibiotic therapy. The patient has no known drug allergies and is a non-smoker. His alcohol intake is limited to social occasions.

Physical examination revealed crepitus on knee movement, tenderness over the medial and lateral joint lines, and effusion in the left knee. The knee range of motion was significantly limited due to pain. Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, coagulation profile, and renal function tests, were within normal limits.

The patient was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis of the left knee and was recommended total knee replacement surgery. He was thoroughly counseled about the procedure, potential risks, and benefits. The risk of postoperative complications was explained, including infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient understood and consented to the surgery.

Preoperative preparations included discontinuation of anticoagulant medications and administration of prophylactic antibiotics. The patient was also advised to undergo preoperative physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint. An anesthesiologist assessed him preoperatively, deemed him fit for surgery, and planned for general anesthesia.

The surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications. The surgeon successfully implanted a prosthetic joint during the total knee replacement procedure. The patient was closely monitored in the recovery room and transferred to the surgical ward on the same day. Postoperative pain management was achieved through a combination of intravenous analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day, aiming to improve knee range of motion and strength. The patient was encouraged to ambulate using a walker or crutches with assistance. Adequate wound care was provided, and the surgical incision appeared clean and well-healed.

The patient was closely monitored for any signs of infection or deep vein thrombosis. Serial laboratory investigations, including blood counts and inflammatory markers, were carried out to ensure appropriate healing and rule out infection. The patient received prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism. Regular physiotherapy and rehabilitation were continued during the hospital stay.

The patient did not develop any complications such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He tolerated the surgery well and regained functional mobility in the left knee. The patient was discharged after four days and provided with appropriate discharge instructions. He was advised to continue physiotherapy on an outpatient basis and to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks.

In conclusion, the patient, a 55-year-old male with hypertension and osteoarthritis, underwent total knee replacement surgery successfully. He had a history of coronary artery bypass grafting without complications. Preoperative preparations and counseling were done appropriately, and the surgery was performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, without any complications. Adequate pain management, wound care, and rehabilitation were provided. The patient was discharged after a four-day hospital stay, showing improved mobility in the left knee.
