The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and obesity, who is scheduled to undergo surgery for gallbladder removal. The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled with oral antihyperglycemic medications. His blood pressure is also adequately controlled with a combination of angiotensin receptor blocker and a diuretic. However, the patientâ€™s body mass index (BMI) is 35, classifying him as obese.

In the past, the patient underwent an appendectomy without any postoperative complications. He has no known drug allergies and denies any family history of clotting disorders or adverse reactions to anesthesia. The patient does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He does not have any significant cardiac, pulmonary, or renal concerns.

The patient presented with typical symptoms of gallbladder disease, including right upper abdominal pain, bloating, and intermittent nausea. An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed multiple gallstones and confirmed the diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis. After discussing the risks and benefits of surgery, the decision was made to proceed with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Preoperatively, the patient's laboratory studies were within normal limits, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and urinalysis. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave changes. Given his obesity, a preoperative anesthesia consultation was obtained, and the patient was deemed to be at an increased risk for perioperative complications due to his BMI.

The surgery was successfully performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated at the end of surgery. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery area and closely monitored for any signs of complications. He received intravenous fluids to maintain hydration, and analgesics were administered to control pain.

The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day and advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. His pain was adequately managed with oral analgesics. The surgical wound was inspected daily and showed no signs of infection or dehiscence. Bowel movements were monitored, and the patient resumed normal bowel function on postoperative day 2.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, or surgical complications such as bile duct injury or leakage. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not require any additional interventions or consults during his hospital stay.

Upon discharge, the patient was instructed to continue taking his usual medications and to schedule a follow-up appointment with his primary care physician. He was also counseled on the importance of gradually increasing his physical activity level and maintaining a healthy diet to promote weight loss. The patient was advised to monitor his blood sugar levels closely in the postoperative period, as surgical stress can temporarily affect glycemic control.

In conclusion, the patient, a 52-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, underwent a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. He had an unremarkable postoperative course with no complications noted. The patient was discharged home on a regular diet, with instructions for follow-up care and lifestyle modifications.
