The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient takes medication for both of these conditions, which are well controlled.

He denies any significant family history of cardiovascular or surgical conditions. However, he does report a nicotine addiction and has been smoking a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his physical examination was unremarkable, except for the hernia. Laboratory workup showed a normal complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. His chest X-ray was also within normal limits.

The patient has never had any previous surgeries, and he has not experienced any recent illnesses or hospitalizations. He expresses some anxiety and concerns about the upcoming surgery but is otherwise mentally and emotionally stable.

His surgical team has recommended that he quit smoking at least two weeks before the procedure to reduce the risks of complications. The patient has been provided with resources and counseling to help him quit smoking, and he expresses willingness to comply with these recommendations.

The patient is scheduled for surgery in two weeks. He is instructed to avoid any food or drink after midnight on the night before the procedure. He is also advised to continue taking his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications as usual with a small sip of water on the morning of surgery.

The patient arrives on the day of surgery and is taken to the operating room. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, and the hernia repair is completed without any complications. The patient's vital signs remain stable throughout the surgery.

After the procedure, the patient is taken to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. He wakes up and reports minimal pain, which is managed with a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

The patient is then transferred to a regular hospital room. Over the next few days, his pain continues to improve, and he is gradually transitioned from intravenous pain medications to oral analgesics. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with no signs of infection or other complications.

He is encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent pneumonia and blood clots. The patient receives regular wound care, and a surgical dressing is applied to the incision site.

The patient's postoperative course is uncomplicated, and he is discharged home on the fourth day after surgery. He is provided with instructions on wound care, pain management, and follow-up appointments.

The patient is advised to continue avoiding smoking and to make efforts to quit altogether, as smoking can delay wound healing and increase the risk of postoperative complications.

Upon follow-up, the patient is healing well, and the surgical incision is clean with no signs of infection. His pain has significantly improved, and he reports feeling back to his baseline health.

In summary, the patient, a 45-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He is physically stable and mentally prepared for the procedure.
