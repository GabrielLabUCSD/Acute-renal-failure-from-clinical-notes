The patient in question is a 52-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and coronary artery disease. Additionally, he has a past surgical history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and knee arthroscopy. His current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and albuterol inhaler.

The patient's hypertension has been well controlled with the current medication regimen. However, his diabetes has been poorly controlled, with his last HbA1c level being 9.2%. He has a history of intermittent episodes of shortness of breath due to his asthma, for which he regularly uses his inhaler. His coronary artery disease is managed with beta-blockers and an ACE inhibitor.

In terms of his surgical planning, it is crucial to ensure that his blood pressure is optimally managed before the procedure. His diabetes, too, needs better control to mitigate the risk of surgical complications. His asthma should be carefully assessed to prevent potential perioperative respiratory issues. Additionally, his coronary artery disease requires close monitoring during the perioperative period.

Following the surgery, the patient had a smooth postoperative course. He was closely monitored in the recovery room and then transferred to the surgical ward. Vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any cardiac or respiratory complications. Pain was managed effectively with oral analgesics, and he was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's blood pressure remained within the desired range, and his diabetes management was continued during the postoperative period. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and adjustments in the medication regimen were made to achieve better glycemic control. He received postoperative physiotherapy to aid in his recovery and prevent any potential complications related to immobility.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any postoperative complications such as wound infection, thromboembolism, pneumonia, or surgical site complications. His surgical incisions demonstrated appropriate healing, and he did not complain of any persistent pain or discomfort. No signs of cardiac decompensation or exacerbation of his respiratory symptoms were noted.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient received adequate hydration and his renal function was monitored closely. Fortunately, there were no signs of acute renal failure. He was discharged on postoperative day four with pain medications and instructions for wound care, physical therapy, and glycemic control.

In conclusion, the patient, a 52-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and coronary artery disease, underwent surgery to be determined. His medical conditions were closely monitored and managed during the perioperative period. Fortunately, he had a smooth postoperative course without any complications. Immobility-related complications were prevented through physiotherapy, and wound healing was satisfactory. Close attention was given to his blood pressure and blood glucose control, with appropriate adjustments made to optimize his medical management.
