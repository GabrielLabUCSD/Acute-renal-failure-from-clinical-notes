The patient, a 45-year-old male, is planning to have surgery and has an extensive medical history. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is a current smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history. The patient's blood pressure is generally well-controlled on lisinopril 20 mg daily.

He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and is managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily and canagliflozin 300 mg daily. His hemoglobin A1C levels have been around 7.5% consistently. He has a history of hyperlipidemia and is currently on atorvastatin 40 mg daily.

The patient has a long-standing history of smoking and has been unable to quit despite several attempts. He reports a chronic cough and wheezing, which has led to his diagnosis of COPD. He is using a combination inhaler of tiotropium and salmeterol twice daily, which has provided some relief.

Additionally, the patient has a known allergy to penicillin but denies any other drug allergies. He has no known family history of clotting disorders or anesthesia complications. He has no previous surgical history, but he did have an upper endoscopy two years ago, which was unremarkable.

On physical examination, the patient has a BMI of 32 and appears generally well-nourished. His lungs have wheezing bilaterally, but he is still able to speak in full sentences. He has no signs of acute illness or infection.

Lab results show a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 140 mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dL. His renal function tests are within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 85 mL/min/1.73m^2. His complete blood count is unremarkable.

The patient is scheduled to undergo elective surgery in three weeks. Prior to surgery, he will have a preoperative assessment, including a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and complete blood count. He will also receive counseling on smoking cessation and will be provided with nicotine replacement therapy options.

During the patient's postoperative course, he tolerated the surgery well and there were no immediate complications. He was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit until he met appropriate discharge criteria. Pain was managed using a combination of oral opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

His blood glucose levels were well-controlled throughout the hospital stay, and his diabetes medications were resumed with the first meal following surgery. The patient's blood pressure remained stable, and he continued taking his home antihypertensive medication without any interruption.

The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications. He was also educated on strategies to prevent surgical site infections and the signs of infection to watch out for. His incision site was inspected regularly, and there were no signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient was monitored closely for any signs and symptoms of respiratory distress, given his history of COPD. His oxygen saturation remained above 94% on room air, and he did not require supplemental oxygen.

There were no complications noted in the patient's postoperative course. He was discharged on postoperative day 3 with appropriate pain control and clear instructions for follow-up. The patient was advised to continue smoking cessation efforts and to monitor his blood glucose levels closely in the coming weeks.
