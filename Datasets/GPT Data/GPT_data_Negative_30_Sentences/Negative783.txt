The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been taking anti-hypertensive medications, statins, and oral hypoglycemic agents to manage these conditions. The patient is a non-smoker and he does not consume alcohol regularly.

He has a past surgical history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy, both of which were uncomplicated procedures. The patient has a family history of heart disease, but he has not experienced any cardiovascular events in the past.

On examination, the patient's vital signs were stable, with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He has no evidence of peripheral edema and his cardiovascular exam is unremarkable. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender. He has no abnormalities on chest auscultation and his lung function is normal.

Laboratory investigations revealed a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL and HbA1c of 7.5%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control. His lipid profile showed elevated LDL cholesterol levels at 160 mg/dL, while HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were within the normal range. Renal function tests were normal, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73 mÂ².

The patient was referred for a preoperative cardiology consultation to evaluate his cardiovascular status prior to surgery. Echocardiography revealed normal cardiac function with an ejection fraction of 60% and no evidence of valvular abnormalities or structural heart disease. Stress testing was not performed due to the patient's low cardiovascular risk profile and absence of symptoms.

Based on the preoperative evaluation, the patient's surgical procedure was deemed low-to-intermediate risk. He was advised to continue his regular medications, including anti-hypertensive, lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic agents, on the day of surgery with a sip of water. The patient was also instructed to withhold food and drink for 6 hours prior to the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He experienced mild pain at the surgical site, which was managed with oral analgesics. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and deep breathe to prevent the development of complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis.

Daily wound care was performed and the incision site showed no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored and insulin was administered to maintain glucose within the target range. His blood pressure remained stable postoperatively without the need for additional antihypertensive medications.

The patient's postoperative course was otherwise uncomplicated, with resolution of pain and normal bowel function. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and was discharged on the third postoperative day. The patient was provided with postoperative instructions and scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to ensure proper healing and continued management of his medical conditions.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, who is scheduled to undergo surgery. Preoperative evaluation revealed stable cardiovascular function and suboptimal glycemic control. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with resolution of pain and prompt recovery. No complications, including acute renal failure, were observed during the hospital stay.
