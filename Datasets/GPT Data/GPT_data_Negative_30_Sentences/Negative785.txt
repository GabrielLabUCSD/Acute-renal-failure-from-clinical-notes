The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently on metoprolol and metformin for his conditions. He has a BMI of 32, indicating overweight status. 

The patient presents with symptoms of chronic knee pain and difficulty walking due to severe osteoarthritis. Conservative management including physical therapy and analgesic medications failed to provide adequate relief. Therefore, the patient and his orthopedic surgeon have decided to proceed with total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough medical evaluation including laboratory testing, EKG, and a chest X-ray. His blood work revealed well-controlled diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities. The chest X-ray ruled out any lung pathology that could potentially complicate the surgery.

The patient was advised to discontinue his metformin one day prior to surgery due to the potential risk of lactic acidosis in the setting of contrast dye used during the procedure. He was instructed to continue taking his metoprolol as prescribed.

On the day of surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital and prepared for the operation. General anesthesia was administered, and the surgeon successfully performed a total knee replacement without any intraoperative complications.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was carefully monitored in the recovery room. Vital signs were stable, and there were no signs of excessive bleeding or infection at the surgical site. The patient received intravenous pain medications to manage postoperative pain.

The patient was then transferred to the orthopedic ward for further recovery and rehabilitation. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding the new knee implant. He was encouraged to bear weight on the surgical leg with the use of a walker.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained within normal limits. He received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely to ensure adequate glycemic control.

The patient's pain was well managed with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. He reported a gradual improvement in pain levels and mobility with each passing day. 

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was assessed for discharge readiness. He demonstrated adequate mobility, pain control, and an understanding of postoperative care instructions. Therefore, he was discharged home with a prescription for oral pain medications and a referral for outpatient physical therapy.

During the follow-up appointment two weeks after surgery, the patient reported significant improvement in his knee pain and mobility. The surgical incision was well-healed, without signs of infection or abnormal swelling. Range of motion in the knee was improving steadily, and the patient was able to walk short distances without assistance.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he experienced a successful total knee replacement surgery. He followed the prescribed medications and rehabilitation plan diligently, resulting in optimal recovery. There were no complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery, as it significantly improved his quality of life by alleviating his chronic knee pain.
