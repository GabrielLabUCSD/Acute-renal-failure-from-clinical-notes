Their HbA1c levels have remained within the target range of 6.5-7.0% over the past year. The patient's lipid profile is within normal limits.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient's physical examination was unremarkable, with normal heart and lung sounds. Their laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and coagulation profile, were all normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no significant changes in comparison to the previous one obtained six months ago. Echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular systolic function with no regional wall motion abnormalities.

The patient's surgical procedure was scheduled due to the development of symptomatic cholecystitis. They underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The surgery lasted approximately two hours, with no intraoperative complications noted. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with normal vital signs and good pain control. They were encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

During the postoperative follow-up appointments, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no signs of surgical site complications. Their vital signs were stable, and their incisions continued to heal well. The patient's glycemic control and blood pressure remained within target ranges. They reported no changes in their urinary output or any significant pain. The surgeon deemed the patient's postoperative course unremarkable, given the absence of complications.

In summary, the patient had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, with previous CABG surgery and cholecystectomy. They were well-controlled on metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and aspirin.
