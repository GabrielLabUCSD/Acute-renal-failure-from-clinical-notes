The patient is a male in his late 50s who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history which includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of smoking. His blood pressure is well controlled with medication, and his most recent lipid panel showed slightly elevated LDL cholesterol levels. His diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and his HbA1c levels have been stable within the target range. He has quit smoking six years ago and has no further respiratory symptoms.

In terms of surgical risks, the patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating he is overweight. He does not have any known allergies to medications or anesthesia. Furthermore, he has previously undergone cholecystectomy and appendectomy surgeries without any significant complications. His medical team will closely monitor his blood glucose levels perioperatively to ensure good glycemic control.

The patient's surgical procedure is planned for gastrointestinal surgery to address a chronic gastric ulcer that has been unresponsive to conservative management. The proposed surgery is a laparoscopic gastrectomy to remove the ulcer. The patient has been educated on the procedure, its potential risks and benefits, as well as the expected postoperative course.

Following the surgery, the patient will be taken to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. There, his vital signs, pain levels, and oxygen saturation will be monitored closely. Pain management will be provided through intravenous opioids initially, and then transitioned to oral analgesics as tolerated. His diet will initially consist of clear liquids, which will be advanced gradually to a regular diet as tolerated.

To prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the patient will be initiated on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin injections within 6 hours after the surgery and continue until discharge. He will also be instructed to perform regular leg exercises and ambulate early postoperatively.

The patient will be closely followed by the surgical team for wound healing and signs of infection. He will receive antibiotics prophylactically during surgery and continue for 24 hours postoperatively. The patient will be discharged once his pain is adequately controlled, he is tolerating a regular diet, and he is able to ambulate independently.

Postoperatively, the patient will be advised on wound care, including the proper cleansing and dressing of the surgical incision site. He will be instructed to watch for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or drainage from the wound.

Regarding postoperative complications, acute renal failure is not expected in this patient. However, he may experience other common complications such as wound infection, surgical site hematoma, or ileus. Steps will be taken to minimize the risk of these complications, such as appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, using sterile technique, and early ambulation.

The patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointments with the surgical team to monitor his progress, wound healing, and to address any concerns or complications that may arise. He will also be referred to a nutritionist to ensure optimal dietary choices to manage his diabetes and lipid levels.

In conclusion, the patient is a middle-aged male with a significant medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of smoking. He is planned for gastrointestinal surgery due to an unresponsive gastric ulcer. The surgical team will closely monitor his perioperative glycemic control and manage his pain with opioids initially. Postoperatively, he will receive prophylactic measures to prevent complications such as DVT and wound infection. The patient will be educated on wound care and infection signs to watch for at home. Acute renal failure is not expected, but other complications like wound infection, hematoma, or ileus can occur. He will have regular follow-up appointments and nutrition counseling to support his overall health.
