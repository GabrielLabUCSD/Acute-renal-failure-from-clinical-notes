The patient is a 55-year-old male, with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is planning to have surgery for the removal of a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. He has been experiencing chronic lower back pain radiating down his leg for the past six months. 

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with antihypertensive medications, and his blood glucose levels are managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a history of smoking, but he quit five years ago. He has no known drug allergies and has not experienced any recent infections.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, renal function tests, and a coagulation profile. All the results were within normal limits, indicating no significant abnormalities. 

Upon further investigation, the patient had a preoperative chest X-ray to assess his pulmonary function. The chest X-ray findings were unremarkable, demonstrating clear lung fields and no evidence of infection or underlying lung disease.

The patient was evaluated by an anesthesiologist who discussed the anesthesia plan and potential risks associated with the surgery. The anesthesiologist determined that the patient was suitable for general anesthesia. 

The patient was then scheduled for surgery and instructed to stop taking anticoagulant medications and any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs one week before the procedure to minimize bleeding risks. He was advised to have nothing to eat or drink after midnight the day before surgery.

The surgery was performed by a neurosurgeon under general anesthesia, and a microdiscectomy was successfully completed. The procedure involved removing the part of the herniated disc that was pressing on the spinal nerves, relieving the patient's symptoms.

In the postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room until he regained consciousness. He received intravenous fluids for hydration and adequate pain control with intravenous analgesics. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period.

The patient was then transferred to the surgical ward, where he continued to receive pain control medications. Physical therapy was initiated to help him regain strength and mobility. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and atelectasis.

There were no immediate postoperative complications observed. The patient's incision site was assessed for signs of infection, but it remained clean and free of redness or drainage. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely to prevent hyperglycemia and promote wound healing.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with gradual improvement in his lower back pain and leg symptoms. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and was discharged home on the third day after surgery. 

Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed oral analgesics for pain management and given instructions on wound care. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and bending for the next six weeks.

During follow-up visits, the patient reported decreasing pain intensity and increased functionality. He followed up with physical therapy as recommended and had ongoing improvement in his range of motion. 

At the six-week postoperative visit, the patient's incision site was completely healed without any signs of infection. He reported being pain-free and back to his regular daily activities. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable.

In summary, the patient underwent a successful microdiscectomy for a lumbar herniated disc. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without complications. In the postoperative period, the patient had an uneventful recovery and experienced significant improvement in his back and leg pain. He followed a prescribed analgesic regimen and physical therapy plan, resulting in a complete resolution of symptoms and a return to his normal activities.
