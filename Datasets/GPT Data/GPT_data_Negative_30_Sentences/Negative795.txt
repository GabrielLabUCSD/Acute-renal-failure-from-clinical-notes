The patient is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes. His blood pressure is well-controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, and his diabetes is managed with metformin. He presents to the clinic for preoperative evaluation as he is planning to undergo a surgery of unspecified type.

The patient underwent an extensive cardiac workup due to a history of coronary artery disease five years ago. He had undergone coronary angiography, which revealed a 75% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with the placement of a drug-eluting stent. Since then, he has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel without any reported adverse events.

His surgical history includes an appendectomy performed 10 years ago and an inguinal hernia repair five years ago, both without any complications. He had an unremarkable postoperative recovery after both surgeries.

The patient denies any known drug allergies. He reports occasional tobacco use but has no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. He exercises regularly and maintains a healthy diet.

In terms of family history, the patient's father has a history of myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother has hypertension and osteoarthritis.

On physical examination, the patient is in good overall health. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He has no visible physical abnormalities or signs of organ dysfunction.

Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. His HbA1c is 6.2%, indicating well-controlled diabetes.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient was counseled about the importance of discontinuing antiplatelet therapy prior to surgery. The risks and benefits of temporary cessation of these medications were explained in detail. The patient is agreeable to the plan and will discontinue the medications as instructed by his surgical team.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He was closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of bleeding or clotting abnormalities. Daily wound assessments were performed, and appropriate infection prevention measures were initiated. The patient received prophylactic antibiotics as per the surgical team's protocol.

The patient's pain was managed using a multimodal approach, incorporating non-opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs, along with opioid medications for breakthrough pain. Physical therapy was initiated early to encourage ambulation and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient was started on a clear liquid diet postoperatively, with a gradual transition to a regular diet as tolerated. He experienced no difficulty in oral intake and had good bowel movements.

There were no postoperative complications reported in the patient's medical records. He did not develop any surgical site infections, wound dehiscence, or other adverse events in the postoperative period.

The patient's pain gradually subsided, and he was able to resume his daily activities within the expected timeframe. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to ensure proper wound healing and monitor his blood pressure and diabetes control.

In conclusion, this 45-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and diabetes underwent surgery without any complications. He had a successful surgical outcome, and his postoperative course was uneventful. The patient followed the recommended guidelines for cessation of antiplatelet therapy prior to surgery and received appropriate pain management and postoperative care. He will continue to be monitored closely in the postoperative period to ensure optimal recovery.
