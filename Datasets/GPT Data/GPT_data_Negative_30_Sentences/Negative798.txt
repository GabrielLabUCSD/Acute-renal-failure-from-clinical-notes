The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, for which he takes lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin respectively. He presents today for elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. The patient reports experiencing chronic knee pain and stiffness, affecting his daily activities for the past five years. He had previously attempted conservative management with physical therapy, pain medications, and joint injections, all of which provided temporary relief.

The patient's preoperative laboratory tests revealed well-controlled blood pressure, total cholesterol within normal range, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. He has a history of allergy to penicillin but denies any other drug allergies. During the preoperative evaluation, the patient was deemed suitable for surgery by the anesthesiologist and was instructed to discontinue his metformin for 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of lactic acidosis.

The patient's preoperative chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. His recent cardiologist evaluation three months ago revealed good functional capacity and no evidence of significant ischemia on stress testing. The patient received appropriate counseling regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery, and he provided informed consent.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient was positioned appropriately, and standard antiseptic measures were employed. A tourniquet was placed, and the procedure was conducted according to the standard protocol for total knee replacement. The operative time was approximately 2 hours, and estimated blood loss was minimal.

In the postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery area for a few hours, during which his vital signs remained stable. Pain control was achieved through a combination of intravenous opioids and local anesthetics. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and was fitted with sequential compression devices to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's knee was examined, and the surgical wound was found to be clean, dry, and intact. He was able to tolerate a physical therapy session where he performed range-of-motion exercises and received gait training. The patient's pain was adequately controlled with oral pain medications, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet.

Over the next few days, the patient's activity level gradually increased, and he was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker. He received continued physical therapy sessions and was instructed on how to properly care for his surgical wound. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of infection, excessive bleeding, or wound dehiscence.

The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day with prescribed pain medications and instructions to continue physical therapy on an outpatient basis. He was also advised to follow up with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and postoperative care.

During the follow-up visit one month after surgery, the patient reported significant improvement in his knee pain and functionality. The surgical wound had healed well, with no signs of infection. X-rays revealed appropriate alignment and fixation of the knee prosthesis.

Based on the patient's progress, it can be concluded that his postoperative course was successful without any major complications. He adhered to the recommended postoperative care regimen and was able to resume his daily activities with improved mobility and decreased pain. The patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and reported an improved quality of life following the knee replacement surgery.
