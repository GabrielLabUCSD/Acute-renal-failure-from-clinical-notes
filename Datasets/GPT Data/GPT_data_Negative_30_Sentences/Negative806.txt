The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He presents with symptoms of chronic knee pain and has been diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis. Non-surgical treatments, including physical therapy and pain medications, have failed to provide significant relief. After discussing the options, the patient decides to proceed with a total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient undergoes a comprehensive evaluation, including blood tests, chest X-ray, and an EKG, which reveal no significant abnormalities. He is cleared by his primary care physician and is advised to stop taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs a week before the surgery.

The patient is admitted to the hospital the day before the scheduled surgery. He undergoes preoperative counseling, including instructions regarding fasting and the anesthesia plan. He receives a spinal anesthesia for the surgery. The procedure is performed successfully without any complications, and the patient is taken to the recovery room post-surgery.

In the postoperative period, the patient is closely monitored for pain control, vital signs, and signs of infection. He is started on a regimen of intravenous antibiotics to prevent any surgical site infections. Physical therapy is initiated to help the patient regain mobility and strength in his knee, and he is encouraged to start walking using a walker or crutches.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient follows a plan of deep breathing exercises and incentive spirometry to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications. He is also instructed on the importance of early ambulation to prevent blood clots. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are applied to his legs to aid in thromboembolism prophylaxis.

The patient's initial postoperative recovery is unremarkable, and he experiences an improvement in his knee pain. The nursing team closely monitors his wound healing and ensures adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, including pain medications and thromboprophylaxis.

On the second postoperative day, the patient develops a low-grade fever of 100.5Â°F. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count and blood cultures, are performed to evaluate for infection. Results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, and the patient is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically.

Over the next 24 hours, the fever subsides, and the patient's white blood cell count returns to normal. Blood cultures show no growth, suggesting that the fever was likely postoperative inflammation rather than infection. Antibiotics are discontinued, and the patient is reassured about his progress.

The patient continues to progress well with physical therapy, gaining increasing range of motion and strength in his knee as expected. On the fourth postoperative day, he is able to perform independent transfers and is cleared for discharge. The patient is provided with discharge instructions, including wound care, pain management, and exercises to be performed at home.

In the subsequent weeks, the patient follows up with his orthopedic surgeon as scheduled. He reports continued improvement in his knee function and reduction in pain. The wound heals without any signs of infection, and the patient gradually transitions to using a cane for walking.

At the six-week mark, the patient undergoes a follow-up X-ray, which shows the appropriate alignment of the prosthetic knee joint and no signs of significant complications. His surgical incision site is well-healed, and he has resumed most of his daily activities without difficulty.

Overall, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery and an uncomplicated postoperative course except for the transient low-grade fever. He is satisfied with the results and reports significant improvement in his quality of life. The patient remains under regular follow-up care to monitor the long-term outcome of the surgery.
