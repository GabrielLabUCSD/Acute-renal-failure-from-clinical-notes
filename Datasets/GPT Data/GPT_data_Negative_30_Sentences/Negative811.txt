The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He has been on medications for these conditions including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin.

The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled on lisinopril, with blood pressure readings consistently around 120/80 mmHg. His diabetes has also been well-managed on metformin, with his HbA1c consistently below 7%. His lipid profile has improved significantly on atorvastatin, with his LDL levels consistently below 100 mg/dL.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of smoking for over 20 years, but he quit smoking 5 years ago. He has been participating in a smoking cessation program and has remained smoke-free since then.

The patient does not have any known drug allergies. He is up to date with his vaccinations, including tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia vaccines. He has had no previous surgeries and has never been hospitalized before.

The patient has had regular follow-ups with his primary care physician and specialists. He has had a recent cardiology evaluation, including an echocardiogram, which showed normal cardiac function. He has also had a recent pulmonary function test, which demonstrated normal lung function.

In terms of surgical risk assessment, the patient has a BMI of 30, placing him in the overweight category. Despite this, he has good exercise tolerance and no significant limitations in his daily activities.

The patient will be undergoing general anesthesia for the surgery, which will last approximately 2 hours. He has been instructed to stop his metformin for 48 hours prior to surgery, in consultation with his endocrinologist. Blood glucose monitoring will be performed regularly during the perioperative period to ensure glycemic control.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to have a smooth recovery. He will be closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for a few hours before being transferred to the surgical ward. He will receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

Pain management will be provided, initially through intravenous analgesics in the immediate postoperative period, transitioning to oral pain medications as tolerated. The patient will be encouraged to participate in respiratory exercises and ambulation to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient will be discharged home once he is able to tolerate a regular diet, his pain is well-controlled, and he is able to perform his activities of daily living independently. He will be given clear instructions regarding wound care and follow-up appointments.

No complications were encountered during the patient's postoperative course. He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the third postoperative day. He will have a follow-up appointment scheduled in two weeks to ensure proper wound healing and monitor for any potential complications. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and expressed gratitude for the care provided.
