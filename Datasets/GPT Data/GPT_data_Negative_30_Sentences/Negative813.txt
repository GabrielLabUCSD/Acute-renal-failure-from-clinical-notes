Additionally, they have a smoking history of 10 pack-years and have made multiple unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking. However, the patient has demonstrated a strong willingness to quit and has enrolled in a smoking cessation program.

Their surgical history is relevant to the planned procedure as the patient had undergone an appendectomy several years ago without any complications. Otherwise, their previous surgeries include a tonsillectomy during childhood.

The patient's preoperative evaluation revealed stable blood pressure and blood glucose levels within target range. Laboratory investigations were performed, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and lipid profile. The results were within normal limits, confirming no underlying abnormalities.

To reduce the risk of perioperative complications, the patient was advised to discontinue antiplatelet medications such as aspirin seven days before surgery. They were also encouraged to continue taking their daily medications, including antihypertensives and oral antidiabetic drugs. 

In preparation for surgery, the patient was advised to stop smoking at least four weeks prior to the procedure. Nicotine replacement therapy was prescribed to assist with smoking cessation. The patient was also given education regarding deep breathing exercises and ambulation postoperatively to minimize pulmonary complications.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia, and the procedure was completed without complications. The surgical team ensured the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable throughout the procedure. 

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced transient postoperative pain, which was managed effectively with analgesics. They were early ambulated to prevent the risk of thromboembolic events and encouraged to perform leg exercises. 

While the patient did not develop any immediate postoperative complications, they did experience postoperative nausea and vomiting, which were controlled with antiemetic medications. On the second postoperative day, their appetite improved, and they were started on a regular diet.
