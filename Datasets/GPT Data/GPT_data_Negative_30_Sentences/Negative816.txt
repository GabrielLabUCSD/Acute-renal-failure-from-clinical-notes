The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a significant medical history. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He also has a long-standing smoking history of 20 pack-years and recently quit smoking three months ago. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, for the last five years. He is currently being treated with metformin for his diabetes, and his blood glucose levels are well-controlled. In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy 10 years ago without any complications.

The patient's current surgical concern is a cholecystolithiasis, diagnosed by ultrasound. He has been experiencing intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past six months, with occasional episodes of nausea and vomiting. His liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound were consistent with gallstones. He has had no episodes of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or jaundice.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a preoperative evaluation. His physical examination was unremarkable except for complaints of right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, and normal liver function tests. His coagulation profile was within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of any significant abnormalities.

The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The surgery was uneventful and lasted approximately two hours. Intraoperatively, the surgeon noted a thickened gallbladder wall and multiple gallstones. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was managed with intravenous fluids and analgesics. He received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was instructed on deep breathing exercises and incentive spirometry to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia.

The patient's recovery was smooth, and he was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day. He was provided with instructions on wound care, pain management, and dietary restrictions. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician within two weeks for a wound check and discussion of pathology results.

During the follow-up appointment, the patient's pathology report revealed chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. No complications were noted, such as perforation, abscess formation, or bile duct injury. The patient reported mild postoperative incisional pain, which was well-controlled with prescribed analgesics. His wound was clean and healing appropriately, with no signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient's postoperative course remained uneventful in the subsequent weeks. He adhered to his prescribed pain medication and gradually resumed his normal activities. His postoperative follow-up visits consisted of wound checks, incisional pain assessment, and monitoring his recovery progress. At every visit, the patient reported satisfactory pain control and no concerning symptoms.

In summary, the patient successfully underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis with chronic cholecystitis. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, with no acute complications such as surgical site infections, bile duct injuries, or dehiscence. The patient made a good recovery, adhered to the prescribed treatment plan, and experienced only mild postoperative pain, which was effectively managed.
