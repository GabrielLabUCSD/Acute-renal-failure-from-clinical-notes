This patient is planning to have surgery, and their medical history comprises several relevant aspects. They have a history of hypertension, with blood pressure consistently ranging between 140/90 mmHg and 150/95 mmHg, for which they have been on antihypertensive medication (lisinopril 20 mg daily) for the past five years. The patient does not report any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath, indicating stable cardiovascular function. They have a documented allergy to penicillin, resulting in a rash when exposed to this medication.

In terms of respiratory health, the patient has a history of smoking, with a 30 pack-year smoking history and occasional coughing episodes. However, they do not report any shortness of breath or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms.

Regarding their gastrointestinal system, the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). They experience occasional heartburn, which is usually well-controlled with over-the-counter antacids, and have not required prescription medications for this condition.

The patient's past surgical history includes an appendectomy at the age of 20 due to acute appendicitis. They recovered without any complications and have not experienced any abdominal pain or gastrointestinal symptoms since then.

In terms of medications, besides lisinopril for hypertension, the patient takes over-the-counter acetaminophen as needed for occasional headaches. They have never had any adverse reactions to acetaminophen.

The patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease, with both parents having a history of hypertension. However, there is no family history of clotting disorders or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

Laboratory results reveal a normal complete blood count, including normal hemoglobin and platelet levels. Their liver function tests are also within the normal range, indicating healthy liver function. Renal function tests have been consistently within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

The patient undergoes preoperative testing, including an electrocardiogram (EKG) and a chest X-ray. The EKG shows no significant abnormalities, and the chest X-ray reveals clear lung fields without any signs of infection or pathology.

The patient expresses their understanding of the surgical procedure, its risks, and the surgical team's plan, indicating good preoperative counseling and patient education. Their anxiety level is reported to be within the normal range.

Following the surgery, the patient has a smooth postoperative course without any major complications. Their pain is well-controlled using a patient-controlled analgesia pump, along with intermittent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Early ambulation is encouraged, and the patient is able to mobilize with the assistance of nursing staff within the first 24 hours post-surgery. No signs of postoperative respiratory distress or gastrointestinal disturbances are observed.

The patient's vital signs remain stable throughout the postoperative period, with a blood pressure ranging between 120/80 mmHg and 130/85 mmHg. Heart rate remains within a normal range, between 70-80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation levels are consistently above 95%.

They are started on prophylactic antibiotics before surgery, specifically avoiding penicillin due to the documented allergy. The antibiotics are continued for 24 hours post-surgery as planned.

The patient is monitored for any signs of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence. The surgical incision appears well-approximated, without any signs of redness, swelling, or drainage. No abnormal laboratory findings are noted during their hospital stay.

During their hospital stay, the patient does not experience any adverse reactions or complications such as deep vein thrombosis, surgical site infection, or pulmonary embolism. There are no postoperative complications related to anesthesia or pain management.

As for renal function, the patient's postoperative course is free from any acute renal failure. Their urine output remains adequate, with no signs of oliguria or anuria. Daily electrolyte panels show consistently normal levels, with no derangements in sodium, potassium, or creatinine levels.

Overall, the patient has a successful surgery with an uneventful postoperative course. They are discharged home on postoperative day three, with appropriate follow-up instructions and medications. Post-discharge, the patient is advised to continue their antihypertensive medication and to monitor their blood pressure regularly. They are educated about potential signs of infection and advised to seek medical attention if any concerning symptoms arise.
