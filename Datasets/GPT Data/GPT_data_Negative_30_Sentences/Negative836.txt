The patient is a 56-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. The patient has been experiencing progressive pain and limited mobility in his knee, affecting his quality of life.

His preoperative workup included a thorough physical examination and basic laboratory tests, which were within normal limits. He was also evaluated by a cardiologist who cleared him for surgery given his stable cardiovascular status. Additionally, an X-ray of the knee joint revealed severe joint space narrowing and bony changes consistent with advanced osteoarthritis.

The patient's current medications include amlodipine for hypertension, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and metformin for diabetes control. He has been instructed to temporarily discontinue metformin on the day of surgery to minimize the risk of lactic acidosis.

During the preoperative anesthesia evaluation, it was noted that the patient has a history of difficult intubation due to a small mouth and limited neck mobility. Accordingly, the anesthesiologist has planned for intubation with a video laryngoscope to ensure a smooth airway management.

In the operating room, the patient will receive intravenous antibiotics as prophylaxis against surgical site infection. Intraoperatively, he will receive general anesthesia and undergo a meticulous surgical procedure to replace the damaged knee joint with an artificial prosthesis.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, or thromboembolism. Pain control will be managed with a multimodal analgesic regimen including opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and local anesthetics. Physical therapy will also be initiated early to aid in mobility and range of motion.

To prevent deep vein thrombosis, the patient will receive prophylactic anticoagulation in the form of subcutaneous heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Sequential compression devices will also be applied to his legs regularly to promote blood flow and prevent blood clots.

The patient will initially be kept on nothing by mouth (NPO) and gradually transitioned to a clear liquid and then regular diet as tolerated. His blood glucose levels will be closely monitored, ensuring glycemic control through sliding scale insulin or adjustment of his oral antidiabetic agent.

On postoperative day 1, the patient will be encouraged to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist. Pain management will continue with a decreasing reliance on opioids and an increasing emphasis on non-opioid analgesics.

Given his medical history of diabetes, the patient will be closely monitored for any signs of poor wound healing or surgical site infection. If necessary, wound care interventions such as dressing changes or antibiotic therapy will be initiated promptly.

In the absence of complications, the patient is expected to stay in the hospital for approximately three to five days, depending on his progress. Before discharge, the surgical team will ensure that the patient can safely perform activities of daily living, including walking and using stairs, with minimal assistance.

Postoperatively, the patient will be scheduled for routine follow-up appointments with the orthopedic surgeon to monitor the healing process, assess the range of motion in the new knee joint, and make any necessary adjustments to the rehabilitation plan.

During the follow-up visits, the patient's pain control regimen will be reassessed, and adjustments will be made as needed. Physical therapy will continue on an outpatient basis to improve strength, flexibility, and mobility in the operated knee.

At the end of the follow-up period, the patient is expected to achieve significant pain relief, improved knee function, and enhanced quality of life. Complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or prosthesis failure are possible but are relatively uncommon in appropriately selected patients. However, acute renal failure is not reported as a complication in this patient's postoperative course.
