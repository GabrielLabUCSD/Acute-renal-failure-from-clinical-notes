Patient X is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father having had a myocardial infarction in his early 50s. The patient is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a hernia repair.

In terms of his cardiovascular history, Patient X has a history of stable angina and had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a drug-eluting stent three years ago. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, along with medications including a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and a statin for secondary prevention. His most recent stress test revealed no significant ischemia.

Patient X's diabetes is well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet modification. His last hemoglobin A1c level was 6.7%. He has no evidence of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, or retinopathy.

His blood pressure has been adequately controlled with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and his most recent measurements have consistently been around 130/80 mmHg.

Regarding his renal function, Patient X has a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ². His urine analysis has shown no proteinuria, and his serum creatinine levels have been stable over the past year.

Patient X's surgical plan includes general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Preoperative evaluation demonstrated no significant abnormalities on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram.

During the surgery, the anesthesiologist provided optimal pain management using multimodal analgesia techniques. Patient X tolerated the procedure well, and anesthesia time was uneventful with stable vital signs.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for several hours. His pain was managed effectively with a combination of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Additionally, he received prophylactic antibiotics as per the surgical protocol.

Patient X's postoperative course was marked by a gradual recovery of strength and ambulation. He experienced mild surgical site pain, which was expected after a hernia repair. His vital signs remained stable, and he had no signs of infection.

During his hospital stay, Patient X was encouraged to walk and participate in deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and venous thromboembolism. He received appropriate education on wound care and postoperative precautions.

On the third postoperative day, Patient X's laboratory investigations demonstrated a slight increase in his white blood cell count, but without any accompanying signs of infection. A repeat urinalysis showed no evidence of urinary tract infection. Appropriate cultures were obtained, and antibiotic therapy was withheld due to the absence of clinical signs and symptoms.

The patient's postoperative recovery continued without any major complications. His surgical wound healed uneventfully with no evidence of dehiscence or infection. Gradually, his pain subsided, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet.

Patient X's postoperative follow-up appointments included a visit to his primary care physician, cardio
