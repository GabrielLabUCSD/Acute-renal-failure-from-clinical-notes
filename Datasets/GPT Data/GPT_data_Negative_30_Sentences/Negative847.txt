The patient is a 60-year-old female who has a significant medical history and is scheduled for surgery. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. Her blood pressure is usually well controlled on lisinopril 20 mg daily. She takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily for her diabetes and atorvastatin 40 mg daily for her hyperlipidemia.

The patient has a long-standing history of smoking, with a 30 pack-year history. She recently quit smoking six months ago but still reports occasional cravings. She denies any history of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an open cholecystectomy 10 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. There were no complications during the surgery, and she had an uneventful postoperative recovery. She has had no further issues related to her gallbladder since then.

The patient has had several prior hospitalizations, including an admission two years ago for an episode of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). During that hospital stay, she underwent coronary angiography, which revealed severe coronary artery disease. Following the angiography, she underwent a four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, which was successful. She had an uneventful postoperative course and has been compliant with her cardiac medications ever since.

She has a history of osteoarthritis in her knees and spine and has received conservative management with physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She is mildly overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 28.

The patient's preoperative lab work revealed well-controlled blood glucose levels, with a fasting blood glucose of 110 mg/dL and HbA1c of 7.2%. Her lipid profile shows stable cholesterol levels, with LDL cholesterol of 90 mg/dL.

She has a family history of breast cancer, with her mother being diagnosed at the age of 65. The patient underwent a screening mammogram six months ago, which was normal.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's cardiac workup, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and stress test, showed no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias. Her echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%.

The patient completed a preoperative assessment with an anesthesiologist, with no significant concerns found. She was provided information about preoperative fasting, preoperative showering, and medication instructions.

Given her history of diabetes, she was given guidelines on how to manage her blood sugar levels during the fasting period before surgery. The patient's surgeon discussed the details of the procedure, including the expected outcomes, potential risks and complications, and the postoperative recovery period.

The patient underwent surgery four days ago for an elective total knee replacement. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia without any complications. The surgical team reported that the patient tolerated the procedure well and no intraoperative complications were encountered.

In the postoperative period, the patient was managed with a multimodal pain management approach, including the use of non-opioid analgesics, physical therapy, and early mobilization. She received prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis with subcutaneous heparin. The patient was able to tolerate oral intake shortly after surgery and did not require intravenous fluid support.

Her postoperative course has been uneventful, with no signs of infection or wound healing issues reported. The patient's pain has been well controlled with the prescribed analgesic regimen, and she has been actively participating in physical therapy sessions. She is gradually regaining strength and range of motion in her knee joint.

During her hospital stay, her blood glucose levels have been well managed, staying within the target range. The patient received appropriate counseling on maintaining glycemic control during the recovery period and was advised regarding the signs and symptoms of potential hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia that may warrant medical attention.

At this point in her postoperative course, the patient is making good progress and is expected to be discharged home in the next few days. Plans for a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon have been made to monitor her recovery and address any concerns that may arise.

In summary, this 60-year-old female patient with a complex medical history underwent an elective total knee replacement without any intraoperative complications. Her postoperative course has been uneventful, and she is progressing well in her recovery. The patient's diabetes and hypertension have been well controlled, and her cardiac function remains stable. No acute renal failure or other major complications have been noted. With appropriate management and ongoing follow-up, the patient is expected to have a successful outcome and improve her knee function.
