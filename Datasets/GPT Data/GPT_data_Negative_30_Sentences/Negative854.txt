The patient is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery. He has a complex medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He had a myocardial infarction six months ago and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. He is a former smoker, having quit five years ago.

The patient's preoperative evaluation reveals stable blood pressure control with antihypertensive medications. His blood glucose levels are well-managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. His thyroid function tests are within normal limits with levothyroxine replacement therapy. His COPD is stable, and his lung function tests show mild airflow limitation.

He underwent an echocardiogram, which shows preserved left ventricular function with no evidence of significant valvular disease. His cardiac medication regimen includes aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.

The patient's surgical plan involves an elective procedure with an estimated duration of three hours. The anesthesia team is aware of his medical history and plans to use general anesthesia with invasive monitoring. The surgical team has taken precautions to prevent surgical site infection and deep vein thrombosis.

Postoperatively, the patient woke up in the recovery room without any immediate complications. He received intravenous fluids and pain control via a patient-controlled analgesia pump. The nursing staff closely monitored his vital signs and oxygen saturation, which remained stable. He was encouraged to use an incentive spirometer, and chest physiotherapy was provided to prevent respiratory complications.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulate with assistance on the first day after surgery. His pain was well-controlled, and he reported minimal discomfort. The surgical wound site appeared clean, dry, and intact with no signs of infection, and the Foley catheter was removed on postoperative day two.

During his hospital stay, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was also initiated with subcutaneous heparin. He was regularly monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or cardiac complications, including electrocardiograms and daily chest x-rays.

On the third day after surgery, the patient was discharged home in stable condition. He was advised to continue his regular medications and follow-up appointments with his primary care physician, cardiologist, and endocrinologist. Home health services were arranged for wound care and assistance in postoperative recovery.

The patient's postoperative course did not involve any major complications. However, he did experience some mild postoperative pain and required prescribed pain medication for several days. He diligently followed the instructions given to him regarding wound care and exercises to prevent blood clots. He did not develop any signs of wound infection, respiratory distress, or cardiac events.
