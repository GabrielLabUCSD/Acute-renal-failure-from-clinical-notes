Patient is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is planning to have surgery to address chronic knee pain and impaired mobility.

Her hypertension is well-controlled with amlodipine 5mg daily, while her hyperlipidemia is managed with atorvastatin 20mg daily. Her diabetes is treated with metformin 1000mg twice daily and she maintains a stable glycemic control.

Patient denies any history of allergies, illicit drug use, alcohol abuse, or smoking. She reports being compliant with her medication and follows a healthy diet and exercise regimen.

Physical examination reveals a slightly overweight patient with moderate joint effusion and crepitation in both knees. There is tenderness along the medial aspects of both knee joints.

Her preoperative laboratory findings indicate normal complete blood count, renal function, and liver function. Glycated hemoglobin levels are within range, indicating good long-term glycemic control.

Her echocardiogram shows mild left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction, indicating stable cardiac function. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate adequate lung capacity with no signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Patient's surgical procedure will involve bilateral total knee replacement to alleviate chronic knee pain and improve mobility. She has been adequately informed about the procedure, risks involved, and expected outcomes and has given her informed consent.

Postoperatively, she undergoes a smooth recovery, initially staying in the hospital for 3 days. She is closely monitored for any signs of infection or wound complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Patient receives prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of surgical site infection and blood clots, respectively. She is encouraged to ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

Patient's pain is managed with a combination of oral analgesics, including acetaminophen and tramadol. Pain scores are consistently low, allowing her to perform physical therapy exercises effectively.

She works closely with the physical therapist to regain and improve knee joint range of motion and muscle strength. Daily monitoring of her vital signs and wound dressing is performed to ensure proper healing.

Patient is discharged home on postoperative day 3 with a prescription for pain medication, anticoagulants, and instructions for wound care and physical therapy exercises.

During the follow-up appointment at 2 weeks post-surgery, patient reports significant improvement in knee pain and mobility. Physical examination shows well-healing surgical incisions without signs of infection or wound dehiscence.

Patient continues to comply with her medication regimen and attends outpatient physical therapy sessions as recommended. She diligently performs home exercises, further enhancing her recovery and functional outcomes.

Unfortunately, at 4 weeks post-surgery, patient presents with a superficial wound infection around the right knee incision. The infection is promptly treated with oral antibiotics. Wound cultures are obtained for further evaluation to guide any necessary changes in antibiotic therapy.

She is instructed to continue with pain management and physical therapy as tolerated, and is closely followed up to ensure resolution of the infection.

At 8 weeks post-surgery, patient shows complete resolution of the wound infection. She demonstrates excellent progress in terms of knee pain relief and improved mobility.

In addition, her glycemic control remains stable, and regular follow-ups with the endocrinologist indicate no need for adjustment in her diabetes management. Blood pressure and lipids are within target range.

Patient continues her rehabilitation program, gradually returning to her daily activities and enjoying an overall improved quality of life.
