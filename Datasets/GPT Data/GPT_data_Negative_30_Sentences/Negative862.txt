The patient is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is currently on metoprolol and metformin for these conditions. 

He is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. The patient reports intermittent pain and discomfort in the groin area for the past six months. He denies any previous surgeries or hernia-related complications. 

During the preoperative assessment, the patient's vital signs were stable. His physical examination revealed a reducible inguinal hernia on the right side. His laboratory results were within normal limits, with a fasting blood glucose of 120 mg/dL and a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. 

The patient was scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure was performed without any intraoperative complications. The hernia was successfully repaired using mesh placement. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). 

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remained stable, with no evidence of hemorrhage or infection. He was started on a clear liquid diet and was able to tolerate it without any issues. 

The patient complained of mild incisional pain, which was managed with oral acetaminophen. He ambulated with assistance on the first postoperative day and was encouraged to deep breathe and cough to prevent respiratory complications. 

On the second postoperative day, the patient's pain significantly improved, and he no longer required any analgesics. His incision site appeared clean and free of any signs of infection. He was advanced to a regular diet and tolerated it well. 

The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day with appropriate wound care instructions. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for the next two weeks. 

During the follow-up visit one week after surgery, the patient reported minimal discomfort at the incision site. The wound was well-healed with no signs of infection or dehiscence. 

The patient was counseled on the long-term expectations after hernia repair and the possible risk of recurrence. He was advised to monitor for any pain, swelling, or bulging at the surgical site and to promptly seek medical attention if these symptoms occurred. 

At the one-month follow-up appointment, the patient remained asymptomatic with no concerns. His incision was unremarkable, and he denied any complications. 

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications. His hernia repair was successful, and he showed good recovery.
