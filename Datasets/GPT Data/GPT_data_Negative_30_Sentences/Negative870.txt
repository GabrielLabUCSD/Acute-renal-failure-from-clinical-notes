The patient is a 54-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been taking medications to manage these conditions, including antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, and statins.

He has a history of smoking for more than 20 years and quit five years ago. The patient also has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.

During preoperative evaluations, the patient underwent an electrocardiogram, which showed evidence of prior myocardial infarction. Subsequently, he underwent a stress test that revealed ischemic changes. As a result, the patient was referred for coronary angiography, which showed significant stenosis in multiple coronary vessels.

Given the findings, a decision was made to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Prior to surgery, the patient underwent education regarding the surgical procedure, postoperative expectations, and potential complications.

The patient underwent surgery and was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Multiple coronary artery bypass grafts were performed successfully. The surgery lasted for four hours, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative care.

In the ICU, the patient was extubated within a few hours, and the hemodynamic stability was maintained. He required intravenous pain medication for postoperative pain control. The patient's blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and insulin was administered to maintain tight glycemic control.

Within the first 24 hours, the patient developed a low-grade fever, which was managed conservatively with antipyretics. His chest tube output was monitored, and there were no signs of excessive bleeding.

The patient was mobilized on the first postoperative day with the assistance of physical therapists. Deep breathing exercises and incentive spirometry were initiated to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications such as atelectasis.

On the second postoperative day, the patient complained of incisional pain, which was managed with opioids. He continued to take his regular medications for hypertension and diabetes. The patient remained afebrile, and his vital signs were stable.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's wound was closely monitored for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, and purulent drainage. However, no signs of wound infection were noted.

By the fourth postoperative day, the patient's pain was well controlled with oral analgesics. He was successfully weaned off supplemental oxygen and was able to ambulate independently. The chest tube was removed without any complications, and the patient's incisions were healing well.

The patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day with recommendations for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and further optimization of his cardiovascular risk factors.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any major complications. He did not develop surgical site infection, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additionally, there were no cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure exacerbation.

The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and cardiologist regularly to monitor his cardiac function, glycemic control, and blood pressure. The surgical team recommended a gradual return to daily activities and a healthy lifestyle to optimize his long-term outcomes.
