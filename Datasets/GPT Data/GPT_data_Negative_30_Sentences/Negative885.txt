The patient is a 45-year-old male, with a history of hypertension and diabetes.
He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been managed with medication.
His blood pressure is usually well controlled, with occasional spikes when he is under stress.
The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago and has been on oral hypoglycemic agents.
His blood sugar levels have been relatively stable, but occasionally, he experiences episodes of hyperglycemia during periods of poor diet and decreased physical activity.
He has no known drug allergies.
The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.
He has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.
He has never had any surgeries in the past.
The patient is currently planning to have a gallbladder removal surgery due to recurrent episodes of gallstone-related pain.
He has been experiencing intermittent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past year.
The pain is often triggered by fatty meals and lasts for several hours.
He has tried conservative measures such as dietary modifications and pain management, but the symptoms persist.
The patient has undergone a complete preoperative evaluation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies.
His complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests are all within normal limits.
An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed multiple gallstones and a thickened gallbladder wall, consistent with chronic cholecystitis.
His cardiopulmonary evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, showed no significant abnormalities.
The patient is scheduled to have the surgery done laparoscopically.
He has been counseled on the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.
The surgery is planned to be performed under general anesthesia.
He has been advised to stop taking his oral hypoglycemic agents the night before surgery and to resume them once he can tolerate oral intake.
The patient has been instructed to fast for at least 8 hours before the surgery.
He will be admitted to the hospital on the day of the surgery and will be monitored closely postoperatively.
The surgery is expected to have a low risk of complications, given that it is a routine laparoscopic procedure.
Following the surgery, the patient will be started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.
He will be monitored for any signs of postoperative complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or bile leak.
The patient will receive postoperative pain management with oral analgesics and antiemetics as needed.
He will be encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and blood clots.
The patient will be discharged once he has regained bowel function, is able to tolerate an oral diet, and his pain is well controlled.
Overall, the patient's surgical plan for gallbladder removal seems straightforward with a low risk of complications.
