Patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, who is scheduled for surgery. Preoperative labs revealed well-controlled hemoglobin A1c levels, normal lipid profile, and stable blood pressure.

The patient's hypertension has been managed with a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and thiazide diuretic, resulting in well-controlled blood pressure over the past five years.

His diabetes mellitus type 2 is well-managed with oral hypoglycemic medications, maintaining a stable hemoglobin A1c of 6.8%. There have been no recent episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia requiring hospitalization.

Hyperlipidemia is controlled through statin therapy, resulting in normalized lipid levels, including LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dL and total cholesterol within the optimal range.

The patient's obesity is a long-standing issue that has contributed to his comorbidities. Despite attempts at weight loss through dietary modifications and exercise, there has been minimal success. His body mass index (BMI) is 34.5 kg/mÂ².

Previous surgical history includes cholecystectomy five years ago due to symptomatic cholelithiasis with an uneventful postoperative course. No complications such as wound infection or bile duct injury were reported.

The patient is known to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and uses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy while sleeping to manage his symptoms effectively.

He has no known drug allergies or history of adverse drug reactions.

Family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father and a brother. However, the patient has not experienced any cardiac events himself.

The patient has a tobacco use history of 30 pack-years but quit smoking five years ago and has not resumed since then.

Physical examination reveals an overweight individual with normal vital signs, including blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 70 beats per minute. Lung auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. No edema, rashes, or abnormal skin lesions are noted.

Preoperative chest X-ray is within normal limits, indicating no active pulmonary pathology.

Electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a regular rhythm without any significant abnormalities, such as ischemic changes or arrhythmias.

Consultations with an anesthesiologist and a cardiologist have been conducted, recommending general anesthesia for the surgery after a thorough evaluation of his cardiac status. No significant risks were identified that could affect the anesthesia management.

The patient's surgical procedure will be an elective laparoscopic hernia repair due to a recent inguinal hernia diagnosis. The operation aims to relieve the patient's discomfort and prevent potential complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely for any signs of infection, bleeding, or wound complications. Regular dressing changes were performed, and prophylactic antibiotics were administered as per the protocol.

He experienced moderate pain after surgery, which was effectively managed with the administration of analgesics, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids as needed.

The patient's recovery was uneventful, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet with no signs of postoperative ileus or other gastrointestinal complications.

There were no signs of wound infection or dehiscence observed during the postoperative period.

Routine blood tests performed during the hospital stay revealed no abnormalities, including normal renal function, liver function, and electrolyte balance.

The patient's respiratory status remained stable throughout the postoperative course, without any signs of respiratory distress or oxygen desaturation requiring supplemental oxygen.

Physical therapy was initiated to promote early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis or joint stiffness. The patient actively participated in the therapy and made satisfactory progress.

Overall, the patient had a smooth postoperative course without any major complications. He was discharged home on postoperative day four with appropriate instructions regarding wound care, pain management, and follow-up appointments.
