The patient is a 46-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history notable for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and sleep apnea. He is currently taking metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin for his various medical conditions. The patient has a history of smoking, with a 10-pack year smoking history, but quit smoking 5 years ago. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

His surgical procedure is being done to address a chronic knee injury due to a sports-related incident. He has been experiencing significant pain and limitation of movement, requiring the use of a cane for walking. Conservative management, including physical therapy and medications, have failed to improve his symptoms. The patient had undergone surgery on the same knee several years ago.

Regarding his social history, the patient is married and employed as a software engineer. He lives with his wife and two teenage children and has a good support system at home. He reports no known drug or food allergies.

Preoperatively, the patient had a thorough medical evaluation. His vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination revealed a well-healed surgical scar on the right knee from the previous procedure, tenderness on palpation, and limited range of motion due to pain.

Laboratory tests were conducted, including a complete blood count, chemistry panel, coagulation profile, and a urinalysis. These tests were within normal limits, except for slightly elevated fasting blood glucose levels indicative of his known diabetes. The patient was cleared for surgery after an evaluation by an anesthesiologist, taking into consideration his medical conditions and current medication regimen.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any immediate complications. The patient was closely monitored intraoperatively, with stable vital signs and no significant blood loss. The procedure lasted approximately two hours, and the surgical team noted the presence of significant ligamentous damage, which was repaired. Postoperatively, the patient received appropriate pain management with a combination of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Following the surgery, the patient was started on physical therapy to aid in functional recovery and reduce the risk of postoperative complications. He was encouraged to engage in regular exercise and maintain a healthy weight to support the healing process and reduce the strain on his knee joint. The patient's vital signs were stable throughout his hospital stay, with no signs of infection or other complications noted. There were no immediate postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with a prescription for pain medication and a referral to outpatient physical therapy. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for wound evaluation and suture removal. The patient was educated on signs and symptoms of infection, wound care, medication management, and the importance of adhering to his physical therapy regimen.

In the postoperative course, the patient showed significant improvement in pain and mobility. He diligently attended physical therapy sessions and gradually increased his activities of daily living. His knee range of motion improved, and he was able to ambulate without the need for a cane within four weeks of surgery. The patient's surgical incision healed well without signs of infection or delayed wound healing.

Six weeks after the surgery, the patient reported no pain at rest and mild discomfort with strenuous activity. He was able to resume his regular exercise routine and had returned to work without any limitations. Follow-up imaging confirmed the successful repair of ligamentous damage, and the patient was deemed to be in long-term remission.

In conclusion, the 46-year-old male patient successfully underwent surgery for chronic knee injury. His medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and sleep apnea. The surgery addressed ligamentous damage and was followed by appropriate pain management and physical therapy. The patient had no significant postoperative complications and showed good progress in pain control and functional recovery.
