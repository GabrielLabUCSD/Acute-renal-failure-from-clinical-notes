The patient is a middle-aged individual who has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. They have been managing these conditions with medications and regular follow-up visits with their primary care physician. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any history of substance abuse.

The patient recently presented with symptoms of pain and limited mobility in their left knee, which has gradually worsened over the past year. An examination and imaging revealed severe osteoarthritis in the affected joint, leading to the decision of undergoing a total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's preoperative evaluation included routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies. Their blood pressure and blood glucose levels were well-controlled within normal limits. An electrocardiogram was performed, which did not show any significant abnormalities.

The patient was deemed fit for surgery and given appropriate instructions on fasting prior to the procedure. They were also counseled on the importance of discontinuing certain medications that could interfere with the surgical process and increase the risk of bleeding. The patient was instructed to continue taking their routine antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications up until the day of surgery.

The total knee replacement surgery was performed without any complications. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure, which lasted approximately three hours. The surgeon successfully removed the damaged joint surfaces and replaced them with prosthetic components. The patient was closely monitored during the surgery, with vital signs stable and well-maintained.

Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. Pain management was initiated with intravenous analgesics and supplemented with local anesthetic infiltration of the surgical site. The patient's vital signs were closely monitored, and they were observed for any signs of postoperative complications, such as infection or bleeding.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. They experienced moderate pain at the surgical site, which was adequately controlled with oral analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote mobility and strength in the replaced joint. The patient was encouraged to perform a series of exercises aimed at improving their range of motion and muscle strength.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any significant postoperative issues such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. They did not develop any wound-related complications or signs of prosthetic joint infection. Their incision site was healing well, with no signs of erythema, swelling, or discharge.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day, with appropriate instructions for wound care, pain management, and physical therapy exercises to continue at home. They were advised to follow up with their primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon in the outpatient setting for further evaluation and monitoring of their progress.

In conclusion, the patient underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. Their postoperative course was uneventful, with adequate pain control and early initiation of physical therapy. They did not experience any complications such as infection or bleeding. The patient is expected to continue their recovery and rehabilitation process, aiming for improved mobility and quality of life.
