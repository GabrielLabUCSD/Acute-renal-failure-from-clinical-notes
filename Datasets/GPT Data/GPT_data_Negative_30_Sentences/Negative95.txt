The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has been managing his conditions with medications, diet, and exercise. The patient reported a family history of heart disease, with his father suffering from a myocardial infarction at the age of 50.

On review of systems, the patient denied any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. His exercise tolerance was fair, with occasional mild fatigue during physical activities. His recent echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function and no significant valvular abnormalities.

The patient was scheduled for elective surgery due to a non-emergency condition. His surgical history includes an appendectomy in his early twenties and a hernia repair procedure five years ago. Both surgeries were unremarkable, without any complications.

Laboratory workup revealed a complete blood count within normal limits, liver function tests showing small elevations in AST and ALT, likely related to his hyperlipidemia medications, and a fasting blood glucose of 110 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of ischemia.

The patient was seen by the anesthesiology team, who assessed his perioperative risk as low to moderate based on his medical history. They recommended continuing his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications up to the day of surgery, while holding his oral hypoglycemic agent on the morning of the procedure.

The surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia, with the patient positioned on his back. The surgeon reported no intraoperative complications, and the procedure was completed successfully within the expected timeframe. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was extubated in the operating room. He was then transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for monitoring.

During his postoperative course, the patient complained of mild pain in the surgical site, which was effectively managed with oral analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis.

The patient’s vital signs remained stable, with normal oxygen saturation levels and no signs of infection. He was able to tolerate a regular diet without gastrointestinal disturbances and passed flatus and bowel movements. Urinary output was adequate, and no signs of urinary tract infection were noted.

On postoperative day 2, the patient’s pain decreased significantly, and he was transitioned to oral pain medications. He continued to ambulate regularly, following instructions from the physiotherapy team, to promote early recovery. The wound site showed no signs of infection or dehiscence.

On postoperative day 4, the patient was discharged home with appropriate instructions for wound care, pain management, and follow-up. He was advised to gradually resume his regular activities, avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous exercises for the next few weeks. The patient was also provided with information on potential postoperative complications and when to seek medical attention.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications recorded. He attended his follow-up appointment two weeks after surgery, where his wound was healing well, and he reported minimal residual pain. The surgical site was clean and free from any signs of infection or abnormal discharge.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, without any immediate or delayed complications. However, the possibility of long-term complications cannot be entirely ruled out, and the patient will need to remain vigilant for any unusual symptoms or signs in the future.
