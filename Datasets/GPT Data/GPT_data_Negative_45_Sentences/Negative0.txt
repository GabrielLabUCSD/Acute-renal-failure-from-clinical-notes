The patient is a 65-year-old male, who has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on medications including lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

The patient presented with worsening knee pain and limitation of movement due to severe osteoarthritis. Various conservative management options were attempted, including physical therapy and pain medications, but there was minimal improvement. After discussing the risks and benefits, the patient opted for total knee replacement surgery to alleviate his symptoms and improve his quality of life.

Preoperative investigations were performed, including routine blood work and imaging studies. His blood work showed well-controlled diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c level of 7.2%. However, a lipid panel revealed elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. The patient was advised to continue his current medication regimen and to avoid any oral intake after midnight on the night before surgery.

On the day of surgery, the patient was administered general anesthesia. The surgical team performed a successful total knee replacement procedure without any intraoperative complications. The patient was monitored closely postoperatively and managed for pain control with a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild postoperative pain, which was managed with analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization and rehabilitation. The patient tolerated the therapy sessions well and actively participated in the exercises.

During the hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and insulin was provided as needed to maintain adequate glycemic control. The patient also received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.

No complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism were observed during the hospital stay. The patient's incision site showed signs of normal healing, with no redness, swelling, or discharge. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with instructions for outpatient physical therapy and a prescription for opioid pain medication, to be used as needed.

At the follow-up appointment two weeks after discharge, the patient reported improvement in pain and range of motion in his operated knee. The incision site was well-healed with no signs of infection. Blood glucose levels were within the target range, and the patient was advised to continue his current antidiabetic medication regimen.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful and successful. He experienced the expected pain and swelling after surgery and benefited from early initiation of physical therapy. There were no complications observed during his hospital stay or at the follow-up appointment. The patient's commitment to continued rehabilitation and adherence to his medication regimen played a significant role in his favorable postoperative outcome.
