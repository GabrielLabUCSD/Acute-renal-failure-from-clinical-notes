The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is scheduled to undergo laparoscopic gallbladder removal surgery due to symptomatic cholelithiasis. The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are triggered by fatty meals.

He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension, which has been managed with lisinopril 10 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. The patient's most recent blood pressure reading was 150/90 mmHg. His hyperlipidemia is managed with atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and his recent lipid panel showed elevated LDL cholesterol levels. His diabetes is being treated with metformin 1000 mg twice daily, and his most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 7.2%.

The patient denies any known drug allergies and has never smoked. He consumes alcohol occasionally, with no excessive drinking habits or history of substance abuse. His surgical history is unremarkable, and he has never had any previous complications related to anesthesia or surgery.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's physical examination revealed a well-nourished male in no acute distress. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/84 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The cardiopulmonary examination was within normal limits, and the abdomen showed right upper quadrant tenderness without guarding or rebound.

Laboratory investigations were conducted, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and coagulation profile, all of which were within normal limits. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

The patient's anesthetic plan includes general endotracheal anesthesia with rapid sequence induction. The surgeon will perform the laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure, which is expected to last approximately 1-2 hours. The patient will receive prophylactic antibiotics, typically cefazolin, before the surgery to reduce the risk of surgical site infections.

In the postoperative period, the patient will be monitored in the recovery room or intensive care unit, depending on the extent of the surgery and any potential complications. Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, will be closely monitored. Pain control will be achieved using a combination of intravenous opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Complications such as surgical site infection, bleeding, or bile duct injury are rare but possible. The surgeon will monitor the patient for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, warmth, or purulent discharge from the surgical incision. Any abnormal bleeding will be promptly addressed and managed accordingly. In case of a bile duct injury, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be necessary to assess and manage the injury.

The patient will be encouraged to ambulate and engage in deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications like atelectasis, pneumonia, or deep vein thrombosis. He will be provided with education on wound care, infection prevention, pain management, and expected recovery time. Routine postoperative follow-up appointments will be scheduled to ensure proper healing and address any concerns or complications that may arise.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 scheduled for laparoscopic gallbladder removal surgery. His preoperative evaluation and laboratory results are within normal limits. The surgical plan involves general anesthesia and prophylactic antibiotics. Postoperatively, he will be closely monitored for any complications, including surgical site infection, bleeding, or bile duct injury. Early ambulation and respiratory exercises will be encouraged to prevent postoperative complications. Routine follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor his recovery progress.
