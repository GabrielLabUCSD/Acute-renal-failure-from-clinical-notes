The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presents to the clinic for preoperative evaluation as he is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair.

His hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of lisinopril and amlodipine. He has a history of myocardial infarction two years ago, but no recurrent symptoms since then. He takes aspirin and atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia. His diabetes is managed with metformin and injectable insulin.

During the preoperative evaluation, his blood pressure is measured to be 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 70 bpm, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He denies any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or exertional limitations. His physical examination is unremarkable except for a reducible inguinal hernia.

His laboratory results are within normal limits, with a fasting blood glucose of 120 mg/dL, HbA1c of 7%, total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 90 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient is deemed fit for surgery, and informed consent is obtained. He is counseled about the risks and benefits of the procedure, including potential complications such as bleeding, infection, and recurrence. He expresses understanding and willingness to proceed with the surgery.

On the day of the surgery, the patient is admitted to the hospital. He undergoes general anesthesia for the procedure. The surgery is performed without any intraoperative complications, and a mesh is placed to repair the hernia.

Following the surgery, the patient is monitored closely in the recovery room. He receives adequate pain control with intravenous opioids and is able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. He is mobilized with the assistance of physical therapy to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

Throughout his postoperative course, the patient is closely monitored for any signs of infection, bleeding, or hernia recurrence. He receives prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. His vital signs remain stable, with a blood pressure ranging between 120/70 mmHg and 130/80 mmHg, heart rate around 70 bpm, and oxygen saturation above 95% on room air. He does not report any significant pain and is able to ambulate independently.

On the second postoperative day, the patient is evaluated by the surgical team and found to be healing well. The surgical incision shows no signs of infection, and he has regular bowel movements. He is cleared for discharge and provided with discharge instructions, including wound care and activity restrictions.

The patient is advised to continue his regular medications and to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks. He is also instructed to monitor for signs of surgical complications, such as wound redness, pus discharge, fever, or worsening pain. The importance of maintaining good glycemic control and blood pressure control is emphasized.

The patient is encouraged to gradually increase his activity level and resume normal daily activities as tolerated. He is advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for at least four weeks following surgery. Smoking cessation counseling is provided, as smoking is known to impair wound healing and increase the risk of postoperative complications.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with no complications observed. He is satisfied with the surgical outcome and reports improved quality of life without any hernia-related symptoms. The surgical intervention successfully resolved his hernia, allowing him to resume his activities of daily living without limitations.

It is worth noting that the patient did not develop acute renal failure as a complication during his perioperative period. His kidney function remained stable, with a normal creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL throughout his hospital stay. No signs of urinary retention or any other urological issues were reported.
