Patient is a 60-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient also has a history of smoking for 25 years but quit 10 years ago. He does not have any known drug allergies.

The patient's hypertension has been well controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily, and his blood pressure readings have consistently been within the normal range for the past year. His diabetes is managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily and his hemoglobin A1c levels have averaged around 6.5%. The patient's hyperlipidemia is treated with atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and his lipid panel consistently shows low LDL cholesterol levels.

Regarding his coronary artery disease, the patient had a myocardial infarction three years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. The patient has been asymptomatic since the PCI, with no chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion.

Prior to surgery, the patient had a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, which included an ECG, chest X-ray, and complete blood count. The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without any acute changes. The chest X-ray revealed clear lung fields and no evidence of cardiomegaly. His complete blood count showed normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count.

The patient has been advised to withhold his oral antidiabetic medication on the day of surgery. He is to continue taking his antihypertensive medication on the morning of surgery with a sip of water. His antiplatelet therapy, however, needs to be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery to avoid excessive bleeding during the procedure.

In terms of the postoperative course, the patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit after the procedure. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any immediate complications such as bleeding, infection, or respiratory distress. He was started on intravenous fluids for adequate hydration and received pain management as needed.

The patient's recovery in the surgical ward was uneventful. He was closely monitored for any signs of bleeding, infection, or cardiac complications. The patient was encouraged to mobilize early and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis.

During his hospitalization, the patient had adequate pain control and his vital signs remained stable. His surgical wound showed no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet without any gastrointestinal issues, and his urine output remained within normal limits throughout his stay.

On the third day of postoperative recovery, the patient developed a fever and increased white blood cell count. Blood cultures were obtained, and he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics pending the results. The patient's fever resolved within 48 hours and his blood cultures came back negative, indicating that it was likely a transient infection that resolved with appropriate treatment.

Following a 5-day hospital stay, the patient was discharged home in stable condition. He was advised to continue his antihypertensive and antilipidemic medications as prescribed. The patient was also instructed to resume his antiplatelet therapy and to follow up with his cardiologist within two weeks for further evaluation.

In summary, this 60-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease underwent surgery without any major complications. He had well-controlled chronic conditions and was on appropriate medications. His postoperative course was uneventful, except for a transient febrile episode that resolved with antibiotics. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with plans for close follow-up with his healthcare team.
