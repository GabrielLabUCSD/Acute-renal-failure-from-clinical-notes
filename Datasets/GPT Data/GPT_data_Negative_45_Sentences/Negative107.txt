His diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and his last HbA1c was 6.2%.

Patient X also has a history of smoking, with a 30 pack-year history, but quit smoking five years ago. He denies any respiratory symptoms or diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirometry results reveal a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 70% predicted, suggesting mild airflow limitation.

He has a significant surgical history, including a cholecystectomy ten years ago for gallstones. He tolerated the procedure well without any complications. Remote from that, he had an appendectomy in his childhood without any long-term consequences.

Laboratory investigations reveal a normal complete blood count and differential. His kidney function is within normal limits with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 60 mL/min/1.73m². His liver function tests are also normal, ruling out any hepatic dysfunction.

Patient X has no known drug allergies and denies any latex or environmental allergies. He reports occasional seasonal allergies but does not require any treatment for them.

In terms of family history, Patient X's father had a myocardial infarction in his late 70s, and his mother had hypertension and passed away from complications of a stroke. He has two siblings who are both in good health without any significant medical conditions.

A preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which revealed normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave changes or other abnormalities. The patient's exercise tolerance is fair, with the ability to walk 2-3 miles without experiencing any significant shortness of breath or chest pain.

Patient X is mentally competent and understands the risks and benefits of the surgery. He has provided signed informed consent for the procedure and has been counseled regarding the anesthesia, expected postoperative course, and potential complications.

Following the surgery, Patient X was monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit. He was successfully transitioned to an orthopedic surgery ward the next day. Multimodal pain management with both opioids and non-opioid analgesics was initiated to control postoperative pain, and Patient X reported his pain to be well controlled.

In the immediate postoperative period, Patient X received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent the occurrence of surgical site infections. He was closely monitored for any signs of infection, such as fever or wound drainage, but none were noted.

To prevent deep vein thrombosis, Patient X received prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression devices during his hospital stay. His mobility was encouraged, and physical therapy commenced early to aid in his recovery and prevent complications like venous thromboembolism and pneumonia.

Patient X’s postoperative course was uneventful, without any significant respiratory compromise, surgical site complications, or deep vein thrombosis. Pain remained well controlled, and physical therapy helped improve his mobility and reduce the risk of joint stiffness.

His surgical wound healed without any signs of infection, and he was discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day. Discharge instructions included information about wound care, pain management, and the importance of continuing physical therapy at home.

Patient X was scheduled for regular follow-up visits to monitor his surgical wound healing, pain control, and mobility progress. He was educated on signs and symptoms of potential complications to watch out for after discharge and knew to report any concerns or unusual symptoms promptly.

Overall, Patient X had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was satisfied with the outcome of his surgery. His pain was well managed, and he did not experience any significant complications.
