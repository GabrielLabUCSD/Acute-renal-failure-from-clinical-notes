The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He has been on medication for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 10 years and has been compliant with his medications. His diabetes is well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, and he has been following a strict diet and exercise regimen to manage his blood glucose levels.

The patient's coronary artery disease was diagnosed five years ago, and he has undergone a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) during that time. He has been asymptomatic since the procedure and has been taking aspirin and a statin medication to prevent further cardiovascular complications.

Currently, the patient is scheduled to undergo a total knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis in his right knee. He has been experiencing chronic pain and limited mobility in that joint for the past two years, which has significantly affected his quality of life.

Prior to the surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray, which all showed no abnormalities. His cardiologist cleared him for surgery, ensuring his coronary arteries were adequately functioning.

The patient will be admitted to the hospital for surgery and will undergo general anesthesia. The surgical team will perform a total knee replacement, replacing the damaged joint with a prosthetic implant. The procedure is expected to take approximately two to three hours.

During the postoperative period, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for complications such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia. He will be started on intravenous pain medication initially, and then transitioned to oral pain medications as tolerated.

Physical therapy will be an essential part of the patient's recovery process. He will receive rehabilitation sessions to regain the strength and mobility of his affected knee. The physical therapist will work closely with him to develop an individualized exercise program to improve muscle strength and joint flexibility.

The patient will remain in the hospital for approximately three to five days after the surgery. During this time, he will be closely followed by the surgical team to ensure proper wound healing and pain management. He will also receive guidance on how to care for his surgical incision at home to prevent infection.

As with any surgery, there are potential complications that may arise during the postoperative course. However, it is important to note that acute renal failure is not expected to be a complication in this particular patient.

After discharge, the patient will continue his physical therapy sessions as an outpatient. He will gradually return to his daily activities and work, taking necessary precautions to avoid excessive strain on his knee joint. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor his progress and address any concerns or questions he may have.

In summary, the patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, is scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery. He has undergone a previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery and has been maintaining good control of his chronic conditions. Following the knee replacement surgery, the patient's postoperative course will involve pain management, wound care, and rehabilitation through physical therapy. No specific complications are expected, with the exception of acute renal failure.
