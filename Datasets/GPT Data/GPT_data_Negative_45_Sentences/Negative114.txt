The patient is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35. She presents with complaints of chronic knee pain and has been advised by her orthopedic surgeon to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of amlodipine and lisinopril. She takes metformin for her diabetes and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. All her chronic conditions are stable, and she has been compliant with her medications.

Her surgical history includes an appendectomy during childhood and a cesarean section for the birth of her last child. The patient has no known drug allergies.

On examination, there are moderate crepitus and tenderness over the knee joint. Range of motion is significantly limited, causing impairment in her daily activities. X-rays reveal severe osteoarthritis, supporting the need for surgical intervention.

Preoperative laboratory investigations including complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, and coagulation profile are unremarkable. Her hemoglobin A1c is 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control.

The patient has been counseled about the risks and benefits of the knee replacement surgery, including potential complications such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and blood loss requiring transfusion. She understands the need for postsurgical physical therapy and rehabilitation.

The surgical intervention, performed under general anesthesia, involves the removal of damaged cartilage and bone, followed by placement of an artificial knee joint. The procedure is uneventful and takes approximately two hours.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is taken to the recovery room where vital signs are monitored. She is given intravenous pain medications and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. Physical therapy is initiated within 24 hours to promote early mobilization.

The patient's postoperative course is generally uncomplicated. She experiences moderate pain, which is managed with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. She is consistently able to perform deep breathing exercises and ambulate with the assistance of a walker.

The patient is closely monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, redness, swelling, and discharge at the surgical site. Dressings are regularly changed, and wound care is optimized to prevent complications.

DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is initiated postoperatively, along with the use of compression stockings. She is encouraged to perform ankle and toe exercises to improve circulation and prevent thrombotic events.

Routine blood tests, including complete blood count and renal and liver function tests, are ordered in the early postoperative period to assess for any abnormalities. The results remain within normal limits.

Physiotherapy sessions focusing on range of motion exercises and strengthening are initiated on the second postoperative day. The patient actively participates in the sessions, demonstrating good compliance and progress.

She is provided with appropriate pain management education, emphasizing the use of prescribed medications, and is screened for potential adverse effects of the medications.

The patient remains on a clear liquid diet in the immediate postoperative period, gradually transitioning to a regular diet as tolerated. Adequate hydration and nutrition are monitored.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient demonstrates significant improvement in ambulation and pain control. She is able to walk short distances with the assistance of a cane and minimal discomfort.

She is discharged home with a prescription for oral analgesics, prophylactic antibiotics, and anticoagulation. Detailed instructions are given regarding wound care, physiotherapy exercises, pain management, and signs and symptoms of complications.

Follow-up appointments with the orthopedic surgeon are scheduled for wound checks and assessment of progress. The patient is advised to continue her regular medications for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

At the two-week follow-up visit, the patient's wound is healing well, with no signs of infection. There is a marked improvement in her ambulation, range of motion, and pain level. She reports compliance with medication, physiotherapy, and dietary restrictions.

Over the next few months, the patient continues to progress in her recovery. She is able to ambulate without assistance and performs daily activities independently. Physiotherapy is gradually tapered, and she is encouraged to continue exercises at home.

The patient's glycemic control remains stable, and she maintains appropriate blood pressure and lipid profiles. There are no untoward effects noted from the surgery or the anesthesia.

At six months post-surgery, the patient reports being extremely satisfied with the outcome. Her knee pain has significantly reduced, and she has regained functionality and quality of life. There have been no complications or setbacks during her recovery.

In conclusion, a 55-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery. She had a smooth postoperative course with no complications. The patient's adherence to medication, physiotherapy, and lifestyle modifications were crucial in achieving a favorable outcome. Regular follow-up and ongoing management of her chronic conditions will be continued to maintain her overall health and prevent future complications.
