The patient is a 55-year-old female who is planning to undergo surgery for the removal of a benign breast lump. She has a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or substance abuse.

Her hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. Her diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic medications, and her last HbA1c was within the target range. The patient also takes a statin to manage her hyperlipidemia, which has resulted in improved lipid profiles.

She had some mild respiratory symptoms a few years ago but was told it was likely due to seasonal allergies and no further management was required. The patient did have an episode of chest pain a year ago, but after extensive workup including a stress test and coronary angiography, it was found to be non-cardiac in origin.

She has had regular mammograms, and the lump was detected incidentally during a routine screening. A diagnostic mammogram and subsequent biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a benign fibroadenoma.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, and her vital signs are stable. She has a BMI of 27, and her cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and her extremities do not show any evidence of edema or cyanosis.

Prior to surgery, routine preoperative tests were performed, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, basic metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram. All results were within normal limits, indicating that she is medically optimized for surgery.

The patient underwent surgery without any complications. She received general anesthesia and was carefully monitored throughout the procedure. The procedure was successful, and the benign lump was completely excised. The surgical team reported no difficulties during the procedure and noted appropriate hemostasis.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room until she met the discharge criteria. She tolerated the anesthesia well and had minimal pain in the surgical site, which was managed with oral analgesics. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of postoperative bleeding or infection.

The patient was given postoperative instructions regarding wound care and pain management. She was advised to monitor for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or increased pain at the surgical site, and to contact her surgeon if these symptoms developed.

In the following days, the patient's wound healed well without any signs of infection. She experienced mild bruising and swelling, which resolved gradually over time. The postoperative pain was manageable with over-the-counter analgesics.

The patient had a follow-up appointment with her surgeon one week after the surgery. During the visit, the surgical wound was inspected, and it was found to be healing appropriately with no signs of dehiscence or infection. The patient reported minimal discomfort and was satisfied with the outcome of the procedure.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course without any significant complications. She was compliant with all postoperative instructions and demonstrated good wound healing. Her surgical outcome was successful, and she was relieved to have the benign lump removed.
