The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is scheduled to undergo elective surgery – a cholecystectomy – due to a recently diagnosed symptomatic gallstone. The patient has been experiencing right upper quadrant abdominal pain and nausea for the past month. His symptoms have worsened in the past week, leading to the decision to proceed with surgery. Preoperatively, the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled on his current antihypertensive medication. His blood glucose levels are also stable with his current diabetic regimen.

The patient's medical history includes a myocardial infarction (MI) five years ago, which was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) resulting in the placement of two coronary stents. He has been prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) since the intervention. The patient reports undergoing regular cardiac and diabetic follow-ups, and there have been no recent complications within these systems.

In terms of his surgical risk profile, the patient does not smoke and has a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range. His exercise capacity is limited due to his recent MI, but he can walk on a treadmill for 10 minutes without experiencing symptoms. There is no history of bleeding disorders or previous surgeries.

Laboratory investigations reveal normal complete blood count, renal function, and coagulation parameters. Liver function tests indicate elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, likely attributed to the cholestasis caused by the gallstone. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows evidence of a previous MI but no ongoing ischemic changes. An echocardiogram demonstrates normal left ventricular systolic function with a calculated ejection fraction of 55%.

Cardiac clearance is obtained, and the patient is advised to continue his current medications preoperatively, including aspirin and clopidogrel. He is also instructed to hold his diabetic medications on the morning of surgery, with close monitoring of his blood glucose levels.

On the day of surgery, the patient is given standard bowel preparation instructions and arrives at the hospital in a fasting state. General anesthesia is provided during the surgery, which lasts approximately one hour, and an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed. The patient remains hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient is transferred to the recovery room and is closely monitored for potential complications. He is started on enteral nutrition, gradually advancing to a regular diet as tolerated. An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted postoperatively, and the patient's urine output is within normal limits. Pain management is achieved with a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The patient's postoperative course remains unremarkable, and he does not develop any major complications such as surgical site infection, pneumonia, or deep vein thrombosis. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remain stable, and he is able to ambulate without assistance on the first postoperative day. The patient is discharged home on the second postoperative day with adequate pain control and clear instructions for follow-up care.

In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and previous MI who underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease. He had stable vital signs and no major postoperative complications. The patient was discharged home on the second day after surgery in satisfactory condition with appropriate pain control and instructions for further care.
