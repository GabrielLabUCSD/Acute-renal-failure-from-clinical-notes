The patient is a 55-year-old female who is planning to undergo surgery. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been on metoprolol for her hypertension and atorvastatin for her hyperlipidemia. Her diabetes is controlled with metformin.

She had her appendectomy 15 years ago without any complications. The patient is a nonsmoker and denies any drug or alcohol use. She has no known drug allergies. Her family history is significant for diabetes and hypertension.

Upon physical examination, the patient appears to be in good overall health. Vital signs are within normal limits with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and her heart sounds are regular without any murmurs.

Laboratory workup shows her fasting blood glucose to be well-controlled at 110 mg/dL and her HbA1c levels are within target at 6.5%. Her lipid panel reveals total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 130 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 50 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 150 mg/dL. Renal function tests, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, are within normal limits.

The patient underwent a preoperative consultation with the surgeon. The surgeon explained the surgical procedure, potential risks, and benefits. The patient signed informed consent and expressed understanding and agreement with the treatment plan.

She was instructed to discontinue metformin on the day of surgery, and her blood glucose levels were monitored perioperatively to prevent hypoglycemia. She was also advised to continue her antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications up until the morning of surgery.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the evening before surgery and underwent a preoperative assessment by the anesthesiologist. Her cardiac status was evaluated with an electrocardiogram, which showed a normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room and underwent a successful surgical procedure. The surgical team reported no intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the anesthesia well and had stable vital signs throughout the procedure.

Her postoperative course was uneventful. She was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit for any signs of complications. Her vital signs remained stable, and she did not experience any significant pain or discomfort. The patient was started on oral pain medications and gradually transitioned to over-the-counter pain management as her pain improved.

The patient was ambulated on the first postoperative day and encouraged to engage in deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. She received appropriate venous thromboembolism prophylaxis following surgery.

The surgical wound was monitored for signs of infection, but no redness, swelling, or discharge was noted. The patient was instructed on wound care and scheduled for a follow-up visit with the surgeon in one week.

She was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day and advised to continue her regular medications. She was also provided with dietary recommendations to aid in her recovery and blood sugar control. The patient was instructed to gradually increase her physical activity levels as tolerated.

During her follow-up visit, the wound was healing well without any signs of infection. The patient reported minimal pain and good glycemic control. Her blood pressure and lipid levels were within target range. The surgeon deemed her recovery to be successful, and no postoperative complications were noted.

Overall, the patient had a smooth perioperative and postoperative course without any complications. She was satisfied with her surgical experience and expressed gratitude for the care provided by the healthcare team.
