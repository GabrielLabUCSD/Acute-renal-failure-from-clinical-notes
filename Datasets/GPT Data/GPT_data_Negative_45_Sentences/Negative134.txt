The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently on medications including lisinopril for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for cholesterol management, and metformin for diabetes control. The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction in his 50s.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has undergone a cholecystectomy in the past due to gallbladder stones. He had an unremarkable postoperative course during that surgery, without any complications. The patient has no known allergies to medications or latex. He has a regular exercise routine and follows a healthy diet, leading to a body mass index within the normal range. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

The patient's preoperative laboratory results reveal a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, suggesting suboptimal diabetes control. His HbA1c level is 8.5%, confirming poor long-term blood sugar control. However, his renal function is normal, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. His lipid profile shows elevated LDL cholesterol levels at 160 mg/dL, indicating a need for better management of his hyperlipidemia. His blood pressure is well-controlled, with readings consistently below 130/80 mmHg.

Given his medical history, the patient is at an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Preoperative cardiology consultation was obtained, and an exercise stress test was conducted, which showed no evidence of significant ischemia. The patient was deemed stable for surgery, but he was advised to continue his medications up until the day of surgery.

The patient was scheduled for elective inguinal hernia repair. On the day of surgery, his vital signs were stable, and no abnormalities were noted on the physical examination. Routine preoperative anesthesia evaluation was conducted, and the patient was deemed fit for surgery. The surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

In the PACU, the patient exhibited stable vital signs and was comfortable. He was able to ambulate without assistance and reported minimal pain which was managed with appropriate analgesics. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was transferred to the surgical ward later that day for further monitoring. He remained stable throughout the postoperative period, with no signs of infection or excessive bleeding at the surgical site.

The patient's postoperative pain continued to improve, and he was able to gradually resume his regular diet without any gastrointestinal upset. He was encouraged to continue with mobilization and breathing exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. The patient was monitored closely for any signs of surgical site infection, but none were noted.

Physiotherapy was initiated to aid in postoperative recovery, and the patient demonstrated good compliance and progress in his exercises. He had appropriate wound healing, and sutures were removed on the designated date without any issues. The patient experienced no major complications during his hospital stay and was discharged on the third postoperative day, after demonstrating adequate pain control and independent ambulation.

During the post-discharge follow-up visit, the patient reported a gradual improvement in his overall well-being. His surgical wound had healed well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's glycemic control remained a concern, and adjustments were made to his diabetes medications to achieve better blood sugar management. He was advised to continue his regular follow-ups with his primary care physician for ongoing management of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

In conclusion, the 65-year-old male patient had an unremarkable surgical history with a past cholecystectomy surgery. He underwent elective inguinal hernia repair without any intraoperative complications and had an uneventful postoperative course. The patient experienced no major complications during his hospital stay and was discharged after demonstrating satisfactory pain control and ambulation. However, his glycemic control remained a concern, requiring further adjustments to his diabetes medications. Overall, the patient's surgical outcome was successful, contributing to improved quality of life and functional capacity.
