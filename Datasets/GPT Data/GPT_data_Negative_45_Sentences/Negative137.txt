The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been managed with medications, including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin, respectively. He presented with symptoms of progressive right-sided knee pain and limitation of movement, which were not relieved with conservative management.

The patient underwent a thorough evaluation including physical examination, X-rays, and MRI. The imaging studies revealed severe osteoarthritic changes and degeneration involving the medial and lateral compartments of his right knee joint. Considering his symptoms and the extent of joint involvement, the decision was made to proceed with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to alleviate his pain and improve his functional capacity.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent routine preoperative workup, including blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray. Laboratory results revealed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. His renal function, liver function, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. His cardiopulmonary evaluation did not reveal any significant abnormalities.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the day before the scheduled surgery. On the morning of the operation, he was off solid food and given a preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The surgical team utilized appropriate sterile techniques and followed all protocols to prevent surgical site infections.

Postoperatively, the patient received appropriate pain management with a combination of oral analgesics and local anesthetics. He was placed on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin immediately after surgery. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote joint mobility, muscle strengthening, and ambulation.

During the postoperative course, the patient demonstrated gradual improvement in pain control and range of motion of his right knee joint. He was able to achieve weight-bearing ambulation with the assistance of a physical therapist and a walker on the second postoperative day. The patient's vital signs remained stable, without any fever or signs of infection.

The patient's perioperative and postoperative recovery was relatively uneventful. He did not experience any complications such as wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or thrombophlebitis. He was able to successfully transition from using a walker to a cane for ambulation before being discharged on the fourth postoperative day.

Upon discharge, the patient was provided with appropriate instructions for wound care, pain management, and physical therapy exercises to continue at home. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and monitoring.

At the follow-up visit, two weeks after surgery, the patient demonstrated good progress in terms of wound healing, pain control, and range of motion. He was able to walk without any assistive devices and reported minimal discomfort. The orthopedic surgeon was pleased with the patient's outcome and recommended continuing conservative management with physical therapy and gradual return to daily activities.

In summary, this patient underwent a successful total knee arthroplasty due to severe osteoarthritic changes involving the medial and lateral compartments of his right knee joint. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications. The patient demonstrated satisfactory pain control and functional improvement, and he was able to ambulate independently without any assistive devices at the follow-up visit.
