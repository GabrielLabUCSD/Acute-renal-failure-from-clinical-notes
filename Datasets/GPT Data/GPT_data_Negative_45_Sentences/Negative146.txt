The patient is a 47-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history which includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past five years and is currently well-controlled with his blood pressure readings ranging around 130/80 mmHg. His diabetes is also fairly well-managed with metformin, and his HbA1c levels have been consistently below 7%. However, his weight has been a challenge, and he has a BMI of 32 kg/m².

The patient underwent preoperative testing, which included a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). All the results were within normal limits, and no significant abnormalities were noted. His baseline renal function was assessed, and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated to be 85 mL/min/1.73m².

During the preoperative consultation, it was determined that the patient would require general anesthesia for the surgical procedure. The anesthesia team reviewed his history and ensured adequate pain management during and after the surgery. Preemptive antibiotics were ordered to minimize infection risk, and the patient was instructed to undergo a bowel preparation the day before surgery.

The patient underwent the surgery without any significant complications. Intraoperatively, the surgical team noted a reducible hernia with no signs of bowel obstruction or ischemia. The hernia was successfully repaired using a tension-free mesh technique, and no further surgical interventions were necessary. The procedure lasted approximately 90 minutes, and the patient tolerated anesthesia well without any adverse events.

In the postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of complications. His vital signs remained stable, and his pain was adequately managed with intravenous and oral analgesics. The patient was encouraged to walk and resume oral intake as tolerated. On the first postoperative day, he was seen by the surgical team, and his wound site was inspected. No signs of infection, hematoma, or dehiscence were present. The patient reported only mild pain, which was managed with oral analgesics.

In the subsequent days, the patient's postoperative course continued to progress favorably. He gradually resumed his normal diet and ambulation. His pain diminished, and he required minimal analgesics. The surgical team emphasized the importance of wound care and infection prevention, providing the patient with education on dressing changes and signs of potential complications to watch for. The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day with appropriate wound care instructions.

During the follow-up visit one week after surgery, the patient's wound site was observed to be healing well. The sutures were intact, and there were no signs of infection. The surgical team advised the patient to gradually increase his physical activity and to contact them if any concerns arose.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery with no significant intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. His recovery in the hospital went smoothly, and he was able to resume his daily activities without major limitations. It is important to note that although the patient experienced a successful surgical outcome, acute renal failure was not among the complications observed in the postoperative period.
