The patient is a 60-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. His hypertension is well-controlled on lisinopril 10mg daily, and his diabetes is managed with metformin 1000mg twice a day.

The patient had a previous myocardial infarction three years ago, for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement in the right coronary artery. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. His lipid levels have been well-controlled with atorvastatin 40mg daily.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent a cholecystectomy three years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. There were no complications during the surgery, and he had an uneventful postoperative recovery.

The patient's preoperative laboratory results reveal a stable hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL, a serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and a glomerular filtration rate of 70 mL/min/1.73mÂ². His liver function tests, electrolyte levels, and coagulation profile are all within normal limits. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient is a non-smoker and denies alcohol or recreational drug use. He has a sedentary lifestyle and does not engage in regular exercise. However, he reports compliance with his medications and a relatively healthy diet.

Regarding his postoperative course, the patient is monitored closely in the immediate postoperative period for the development of any potential complications. He is placed on prophylactic antibiotics and is kept well-hydrated to prevent any infections. Pain control is managed with a combination of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

During his hospital stay, the patient develops a postoperative wound infection at the surgical site. It is characterized by erythema, warmth, and purulent drainage. A wound culture is obtained, and empiric antibiotics are initiated based on the suspected causative organisms. The patient's wound infection is successfully treated with antibiotic therapy, and he experiences no further complications.

His postoperative recovery progresses well, and he is gradually weaned off opioids and transitioned to non-opioid analgesics. Physical therapy is initiated to help regain strength and mobility. During his hospitalization, the patient receives proper education on wound care and infection prevention to prevent further complications.

The patient's renal function remains stable throughout the postoperative period, with no significant changes in his serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate. He does not experience any acute renal failure or electrolyte imbalances.

Given his medical history, the patient's surgical team is vigilant in monitoring his cardiovascular status, ensuring adequate glycemic control, and minimizing the risk of surgical site infections. He is closely followed up after discharge to ensure proper wound healing and to monitor for any delayed complications.

In conclusion, this 60-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease is planning to undergo surgery. He had a previous myocardial infarction, cholecystectomy, and is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy. Despite a postoperative wound infection, his overall postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications related to renal function.
