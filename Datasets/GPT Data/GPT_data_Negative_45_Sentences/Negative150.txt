The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who is planning to undergo surgery. Her hypertension is well-controlled on medication, and her diabetes is managed with diet and exercise. She has no known drug allergies. The patient had a previous surgery five years ago to remove her gallbladder without any complications.

Her current medications include metoprolol for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and a daily aspirin for cardiovascular protection. She does not smoke and rarely drinks alcohol. Her exercise tolerance is limited due to knee osteoarthritis, which she manages with over-the-counter pain relievers and occasional physical therapy.

The patient's preoperative lab results reveal a normal complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. Her fasting blood glucose level is well-controlled at 120 mg/dL. Her echocardiogram shows a preserved ejection fraction with no significant valvular abnormalities.

She will undergo surgery under general anesthesia with the expectation of a routine postoperative course. Necessary precautions will be taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis, such as early ambulation and the use of compression stockings. The patient will receive perioperative antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

Following surgery, the patient is expected to make a smooth recovery. She will be closely monitored in the immediate postoperative period for any signs of infection, bleeding, or other complications. Pain management will involve a combination of non-opioid analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia with opioids as needed.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no significant complications. She experienced some mild pain at the surgical site, which was managed effectively with analgesics. Her vital signs remained stable throughout her hospital stay, and she progressed well in terms of mobilization and pain control.

The patient's surgical wound showed satisfactory healing without signs of infection or dehiscence. She was discharged on the third postoperative day with appropriate instructions for wound care and pain management at home. The patient was advised to continue her regular medications and to schedule a follow-up visit with her primary care physician in two weeks.

In the outpatient setting, the patient continued to do well. Her surgical wound had completely healed without any signs of infection. She reported minimal pain and had resumed her normal daily activities, with improved exercise tolerance due to the resolution of her knee pain. The patient's blood pressure remained well-controlled, and her blood glucose levels were stable.

At the two-week follow-up visit, the patient's physical examination was unremarkable. Her blood pressure was within the target range, and her fasting blood glucose level was within normal limits. She had no complaints or concerns. The patient was advised to continue her current management plan for hypertension and diabetes.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery and an uncomplicated postoperative course. She followed all instructions and achieved a good recovery. The surgical team provided appropriate care, ensuring the patient's safety and well-being throughout the entire perioperative period. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome and appreciated the comprehensive and compassionate care she received.
