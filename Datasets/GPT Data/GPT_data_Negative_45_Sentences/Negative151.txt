The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. The patient has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 5 years ago. He denies any allergies to medications or food. The patient's preoperative laboratories and imaging studies, including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG), were within normal limits.

The patient's diabetes is well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a recent HbA1c level of 6.8%. The patient's blood pressure is currently managed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, resulting in stable readings around 130/80 mmHg. His total cholesterol is 190 mg/dL, and his low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is 110 mg/dL. The patient's home medications include metformin, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and lisinopril.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient was counseled about smoking cessation and given relevant educational material. He was also instructed to stop taking metformin 48 hours before surgery to reduce the risk of lactic acidosis. The patient was compliant with these instructions and reported no further use of tobacco.

On the day of the surgery, the patient received appropriate preoperative antibiotics and underwent general anesthesia. The hernia repair was completed successfully without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area without any immediate postoperative issues.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, wound healing, and potential complications. He received oral analgesics to manage postoperative discomfort. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period. His surgical wound was assessed daily for signs of infection or delayed healing.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day three. Before discharge, the patient received clear instructions on wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician within two weeks for a postoperative check-up.

During the follow-up visit, the patient reported minimal pain at the surgical site, which resolved over time. The wound was well-healed without signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable. There were no signs of surgical site infection or other complications.

Overall, the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course following hernia repair surgery. The successful outcome can be attributed to appropriate preoperative optimization, meticulous surgical technique, and excellent postoperative care. The patient's compliance with lifestyle modifications and medication management likely contributed to his favorable outcome.
