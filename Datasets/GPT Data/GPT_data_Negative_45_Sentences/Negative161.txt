Patient is a 45-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She presents to the clinic with symptoms of severe osteoarthritis in her right knee, which has progressively worsened over the past year. Despite conservative management, including physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections, her symptoms have not significantly improved. After careful consideration, the decision has been made to proceed with a total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's preoperative workup consisted of routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, which were all within normal limits. Imaging studies, such as X-rays and MRI, confirmed severe degenerative changes and significant joint space narrowing in the right knee. The patient was cleared for surgery by her primary care physician and referred to an orthopedic surgeon.

On the day of surgery, the patient was educated about the procedure, risks, and expected outcomes. She provided informed consent, and the surgical team ensured her comfort and safety. The anesthesiologist administered general anesthesia, and the patient was positioned appropriately for surgery. The procedure itself went smoothly without any unexpected complications. The surgeon replaced the damaged joint with a prosthetic knee, and appropriate postoperative measures were taken to prevent infection and deep vein thrombosis.

Following surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring and recovery. She experienced some pain and discomfort initially, which were managed with intravenous pain medications. Physical therapists visited the patient regularly to initiate early mobilization and encourage range of motion exercises. The patient was also advised on postoperative care, including wound care and pain management techniques.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker within 24 hours. She gradually transitioned to using a cane for support and started physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the new joint. The surgical wound showed signs of normal healing with no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient was closely monitored for any signs of complications, such as fever, wound drainage, or excessive swelling, but none were observed.

A follow-up visit was scheduled two weeks post-surgery to assess the patient's progress. At this visit, it was noted that the patient's pain level had significantly decreased, and she was able to perform activities of daily living with minimal discomfort. Range of motion in the surgically repaired knee had improved, and physical therapy was continued to further enhance joint mobility and strength.

Overall, the patient's recovery from total knee replacement surgery was successful, and she did not experience any major complications. Her commitment to postoperative care and rehabilitation greatly contributed to this positive outcome. The patient was advised to continue with regular follow-up visits and to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including managing her hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, to ensure long-term success with her new knee joint.
