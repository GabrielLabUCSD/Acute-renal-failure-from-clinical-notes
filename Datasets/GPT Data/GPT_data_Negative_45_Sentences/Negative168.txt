The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. He presents with a chief complaint of chronic knee pain and limited mobility due to severe osteoarthritis. After conservative treatments, including physical therapy and pain medications, have failed to provide significant improvement, the patient has opted for total knee replacement surgery. 

The patient's past surgical history includes an appendectomy and a gallbladder removal. He has no known drug allergies. Current medications include metoprolol for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for dyslipidemia. The patient smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. 

On physical examination, the patient has tenderness and warmth over the affected knee joint. There is crepitus with range of motion and evidence of joint swelling. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, indicating obesity, and his blood pressure is well-controlled at 130/80 mmHg. 

Preoperative investigations, including blood tests and imaging studies, show no abnormalities apart from elevated fasting blood glucose levels consistent with his known diabetes. The patient is consented for surgery and instructed to stop smoking at least two weeks before the procedure to reduce postoperative complications.

The patient undergoes total knee replacement surgery in the left knee under general anesthesia. Intraoperative findings reveal severe cartilage degeneration and bone-on-bone contact. The surgeon successfully implants the prosthesis with good joint stability. The patient tolerates the procedure well and is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

Postoperatively, the patient is started on intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis against surgical site infection. He is also receiving patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids for pain management. Physical therapy is initiated within a few hours of surgery to promote early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pneumonia.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops transient hypotension, likely due to the effects of anesthesia and fluid shifts. This is promptly managed with intravenous fluids and close monitoring. His vital signs stabilize, and he remains hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of his hospital stay.

The patient is regularly assessed for wound healing, signs of infection, and pain control. His blood glucose levels are monitored closely, and insulin therapy is adjusted as needed to maintain optimal glycemic control. Despite his history of smoking, there are no immediate complications related to impaired wound healing or pulmonary issues.

On postoperative day three, the patient is deemed clinically stable and is discharged home with a prescription for oral antibiotics, analgesics, and instructions for rehabilitation. The patient is advised to continue smoking cessation efforts to promote healing and overall health.

In the weeks following discharge, the patient undergoes regular physical therapy sessions to optimize range of motion and strengthen the knee joint. He is advised to follow a diet and exercise plan to aid in weight loss, which will alleviate stress on the replaced joint. 

At the two-week postoperative follow-up, the patient's wound is healing well, and there are no signs of infection. The patient reports improved pain control and increased mobility. He is provided with additional instructions for long-term care and encouraged to maintain an active lifestyle to maximize the success of the knee replacement.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male undergoing total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The surgery is successful, and the patient tolerates it well without any acute complications. He experiences transient hypotension but recovers promptly. Despite being a smoker, there are no immediate complications related to healing or pulmonary function. The patient is discharged home on appropriate medications and undergoes rehabilitation. At the follow-up appointment, he demonstrates good progress in pain control and mobility. Overall, the patient's postoperative course is uneventful.
