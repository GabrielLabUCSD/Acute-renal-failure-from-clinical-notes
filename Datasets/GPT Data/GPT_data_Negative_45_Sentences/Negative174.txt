Mrs. Smith is a 55-year-old female patient with a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is currently managed with medications, including amlodipine 10 mg daily and metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She has a body mass index of 30, indicating obesity.

The reason for Mrs. Smith's surgery is an elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. She has been experiencing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. An ultrasound revealed multiple gallstones and confirmed the need for surgical intervention.

Prior to surgery, Mrs. Smith's blood pressure has been adequately controlled with her current antihypertensive regimen. Her fasting blood glucose levels have been within the target range, indicating good glycemic control. Her renal function tests have also been consistently normal, with no evidence of renal impairment.

As part of the preoperative workup, Mrs. Smith underwent an electrocardiogram and chest X-ray, which showed no significant abnormalities. Additionally, her complete blood count and coagulation profile were within normal limits.

On the day of surgery, Mrs. Smith was brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The surgeon performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, successfully removing the gallbladder while ensuring no injury to the common bile duct. The surgery was uneventful and lasted approximately one hour.

Postoperatively, Mrs. Smith was transferred to the recovery room where she was closely monitored for vital signs, pain control, and early ambulation. She received intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and prevent any potential postoperative complications. In addition to her regular antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications, she was also given prophylactic antibiotics for infection prevention.

Mrs. Smith's postoperative course was smooth, with no immediate complications. She reported mild-to-moderate incisional pain, which was effectively managed with oral analgesics. Her vital signs remained stable, and she showed no signs of sepsis or wound infection.

On the first postoperative day, Mrs. Smith was encouraged to ambulate, and she tolerated a regular diet without any gastrointestinal distress. The surgical site was inspected and found to be clean, dry, and without signs of erythema or drainage.

She was discharged home on the second postoperative day with appropriate instructions for wound care, diet, and medication management. Mrs. Smith was advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous physical activity for the next two weeks to allow for proper healing.

During her follow-up visits, Mrs. Smith displayed good recovery progress. Her surgical incisions healed well, and she reported minimal residual discomfort. Her blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained within normal limits, indicating adequate control of her chronic conditions.

Mrs. Smith did not experience any complications related to the surgery, such as wound infection, bleeding, or bile leakage. However, it is worth noting that she did not develop acute renal failure as a result of the surgery as well.

In conclusion, Mrs. Smith underwent an elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. Her preoperative evaluation showed good control of her hypertension and diabetes. The surgery was successful, and her postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications observed. Mrs. Smith made a smooth recovery and was discharged home on the second postoperative day.
