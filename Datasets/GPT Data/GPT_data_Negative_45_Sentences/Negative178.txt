The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently managed on metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. He is a former smoker, having quit ten years ago. He has a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure.

The patient is scheduled to undergo an elective surgery for inguinal hernia repair. His preoperative evaluation reveals well-controlled blood sugar levels with a recent HbA1c of 6.7%. His blood pressure is adequately controlled, with a recent reading of 128/78 mmHg. His cholesterol levels are within the target range, with a total cholesterol of 170 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol of 90 mg/dL.

On physical examination, the patient is in good general health with no remarkable findings. His abdominal examination shows an obvious reducible inguinal hernia, without signs of incarceration or strangulation. His cardiorespiratory examination is unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and clear lung fields.

Laboratory investigations reveal normal renal function, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. His liver function tests, coagulation profile, and complete blood count are all within normal limits. He has a negative urine analysis and culture, ruling out any urinary tract infection.

In terms of his surgical readiness, the patient has been advised to discontinue his antihypertensive medication on the morning of surgery. He has been instructed not to eat or drink anything after midnight the night before the operation. He will be given prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery to reduce the risk of infection.

Following the surgery, the patient recovers well. He experiences mild pain at the surgical site, which is adequately managed with oral analgesics. His vital signs remain stable throughout the postoperative period, with blood pressure readings ranging from 120/70 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg.

His postoperative course is uneventful, with a return of bowel function on postoperative day one. He is able to tolerate a regular diet and passes flatus without difficulty. The surgical wound appears clean and well-healing, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient is educated on proper wound care and advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next four weeks to prevent hernia recurrence.

The patient is regularly monitored for any signs of complications, such as wound infection, hematoma formation, or recurrent hernia. He is seen for follow-up two weeks after surgery, at which point he reports continued improvement in pain and normal daily activities. His surgical wound has completely healed and there are no signs of infection.

In conclusion, the patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled. He will undergo inguinal hernia repair and is deemed fit for surgery after a thorough preoperative evaluation. Following surgery, he has an uneventful postoperative course with no complications, and his recovery is considered successful. He is advised to continue his regular medications and maintain regular follow-up appointments to monitor his chronic conditions.
