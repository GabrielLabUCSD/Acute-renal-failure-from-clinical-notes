The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a significant medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has a long-standing history of smoking, with a 30 pack-year history. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.

In regards to his current medical issues, the patient has been experiencing increasing fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion. He has also noticed swelling in his lower extremities and has gained approximately 10 pounds in the past month. His primary care physician performed an echocardiogram that revealed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection fraction of 45%. He was subsequently referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.

During the cardiology evaluation, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. The left main coronary artery had a 95% stenosis, the left anterior descending artery had a 90% stenosis, and the right coronary artery had an 80% stenosis. The patient was deemed to be an appropriate candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent several tests and consultations. He had a preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG), which showed sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions. His preoperative laboratory tests were within normal limits, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests. He had a chest x-ray that showed clear lung fields and no evidence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Additionally, he attended a preoperative education session and met with the anesthesiologist to discuss the anesthesia plan for surgery.

The patient's surgery was scheduled for the following week. He underwent CABG surgery, during which the surgeon performed a single-vessel graft using the left internal mammary artery to bypass the left anterior descending artery. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU) for close monitoring. He was initially intubated and mechanically ventilated to support his respiratory function.

In the CSICU, the patient was managed with hemodynamic monitoring, including invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, central venous pressure monitoring, and continuous cardiac output monitoring. He received intravenous medications for pain control, including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Additionally, he received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

The patient's postoperative course was initially complicated by atrial fibrillation, which required treatment with antiarrhythmic medications. He experienced episodes of hypotension and bradycardia during his stay in the CSICU, which were managed with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. His postoperative chest x-ray showed stable pulmonary status without evidence of consolidation or effusion.

The patient gradually improved over the course of his hospital stay. He was weaned off the ventilator and extubated on postoperative day two. His pain was adequately managed, allowing him to participate in early ambulation. He received physical therapy sessions to optimize his mobility and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's wound healing was unremarkable, without signs of infection or dehiscence. He had daily laboratory tests, including complete blood counts and metabolic panels, which remained within normal limits. His cardiac function was monitored with daily ECGs, which showed stable sinus rhythm without significant arrhythmias.

Following a successful recovery in the CSICU, the patient was transferred to the cardiac step-down unit for further monitoring and rehabilitation. In the step-down unit, his medications were adjusted, and he received additional education regarding his postoperative care, including dietary restrictions and medication management.

During his hospitalization, the patient received comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation, including graded exercise training, nutritional counseling, and smoking cessation counseling. The multidisciplinary team, including cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists, collaborated to ensure optimal recovery and prevention of postoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course was largely uneventful, and he did not experience any major complications. His cardiac function improved, as evidenced by a repeat echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 55%, with resolution of the left ventricular hypertrophy. His diabetes and hypertension were well controlled with medications, and he was advised to continue taking statins for his hyperlipidemia.

After an uncomplicated recovery, the patient was discharged home on postoperative day seven. He was provided with detailed discharge instructions, which included wound care, medications, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments. The patient was advised to continue his cardiac rehabilitation program on an outpatient basis to further enhance his recovery and overall cardiovascular health.

The patient was scheduled for a follow-up visit with his cardiologist in two weeks to assess his progress and make any necessary adjustments to his medications. He was also scheduled for regular cardiac check-ups to monitor his cardiac function, lipid profile, and blood pressure.

In summary, the patient had a successful CABG surgery for severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. His postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation and hemodynamic instability but overall improved gradually with appropriate management. He did not experience any major complications and was discharged home to continue his recovery and participate in cardiac rehabilitation.
