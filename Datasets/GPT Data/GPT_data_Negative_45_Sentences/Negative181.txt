The patient is a 45-year-old female, with a medical history significant for hypertension and osteoarthritis. She has been experiencing severe pain and limited mobility in her right knee and has tried conservative management measures such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections, without significant improvement. Due to the persistence of symptoms impacting her quality of life, she has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation, including a comprehensive medical history and physical examination. Laboratory investigations showed normal renal and hepatic function, and she had no signs of acute renal failure. Her blood pressure was well-controlled on antihypertensive medication, and her cardiac evaluation revealed no significant abnormalities. Additionally, she had an unremarkable pulmonary function test.

The patient provided informed consent for the surgical procedure and received thorough preoperative counseling. She was advised about the potential risks and benefits associated with the surgery and the expected postoperative course. She was also instructed on the importance of following the postoperative rehabilitation plan and attending physical therapy sessions.

The patient underwent total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure went smoothly, and no intraoperative complications were noted. Her vital signs remained stable throughout the surgery, and she required no blood transfusions. Postoperatively, she was closely monitored in the recovery room and then transferred to the orthopedic surgery ward.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced pain, which was effectively managed with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. She was instructed on proper wound care and the prevention of complications such as infection. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day, focusing on range of motion exercises and gait training.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. She tolerated a regular diet without any issues and had satisfactory urine output. Daily rounds were conducted by the medical team to ensure adequate pain management, wound healing, and early mobilization. The patient was encouraged to actively participate in her recovery process and adhere to the prescribed medication regimen.

On the third postoperative day, the patient developed a superficial wound infection, which was promptly diagnosed and treated with antibiotics. The infection resolved within a few days without any need for surgical intervention. Despite this complication, her overall progress remained on track, and she continued to make steady improvements in her range of motion and physical function.

Physical therapy interventions were gradually advanced over the following weeks, incorporating strengthening exercises and more demanding functional activities. The patient actively engaged in her rehabilitation program and demonstrated excellent compliance. She exhibited good weight-bearing tolerance and achieved independence in activities of daily living within the expected timeframe.

The patient was monitored closely for any signs of venous thromboembolism and received prophylactic anticoagulation therapy as per protocol. She did not develop any deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism throughout her hospital stay.

After an unremarkable postoperative course, the patient was discharged home on the postoperative day six. She was provided with instructions for continuing physical therapy as an outpatient and for managing her medications. The wound had healed well by the time of discharge, and she was advised to maintain regular follow-up with her orthopedic surgeon for long-term monitoring.

In summary, this 45-year-old female underwent total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis of the right knee. Preoperatively, she had well-controlled hypertension and underwent a thorough evaluation, which revealed no contraindications for surgery. The surgical procedure was uneventful, with no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, she experienced pain, which was managed effectively. Despite a superficial wound infection, the patient's overall recovery was satisfactory. She achieved independence in activities of daily living and was discharged home on postoperative day six, with plans for outpatient physical therapy and long-term follow-up.
