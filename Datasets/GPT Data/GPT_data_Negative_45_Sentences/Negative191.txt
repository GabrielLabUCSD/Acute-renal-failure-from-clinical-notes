The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with symptoms of chronic knee pain and severe arthritis, which has significantly impacted his daily activities and quality of life. His knee pain has been unresponsive to conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medications.

On examination, his knee shows significant swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion. X-rays reveal severe joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis, confirming the diagnosis of advanced osteoarthritis. Based on these findings, the patient and his orthopedic surgeon have decided to proceed with total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's preoperative evaluation includes a comprehensive medical assessment. His hypertension is well-controlled on antihypertensive medications, and his diabetes is managed with diet and exercise. His lipid profile is within normal limits on statin therapy, and his renal function is also normal. He does not have a history of bleeding disorders or any known drug allergies.

Lab tests, including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and liver function tests, are all within normal limits. The patient's ECG shows normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes. Chest X-ray reveals clear lung fields, ruling out any significant respiratory pathology. With these favorable results, the patient is deemed medically fit for surgery.

Prior to surgery, the patient undergoes a thorough discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure. Informed consent is obtained, and the patient's questions and concerns are addressed. He also attends a preoperative education session, where he learns about postoperative pain management techniques, physical therapy, and expected recovery milestones.

The patient undergoes general anesthesia for the surgery. The procedure involves removing the damaged knee joint surfaces and replacing them with an artificial prosthesis. The surgery is successfully completed without any intraoperative complications.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is transferred to the recovery room for monitoring. He is administered pain medications to ensure adequate pain control. Continuous passive motion machines are applied to his knee to promote early range of motion and prevent stiffness. Physical therapy starts on the day of surgery, where he begins with gentle exercises and ambulation with a walker.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful. He experiences the expected postoperative pain, but it is well-managed with a combination of oral analgesics and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. His vital signs remain stable, and there are no signs of infection or wound complications at the surgical site.

The patient progresses well during his hospital stay and demonstrates good cooperation and determination during physical therapy sessions. He achieves independence in walking with an assistive device and shows improvement in joint range of motion. The surgical wound gradually heals without any signs of dehiscence or infection.

After five days, the patient is discharged home with a prescription for oral pain medications and a referral for outpatient physical therapy. He is advised to continue his antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications as before. The patient is also educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, infection, and implant loosening, and is instructed to seek medical attention if any concerns arise.

Overall, the patient's surgical intervention for total knee replacement was successful, with no significant complications in the postoperative period. He is expected to continue his rehabilitation and achieve substantial improvement in functional mobility and pain relief. Regular follow-up visits are scheduled to monitor his progress and address any concerns that may arise.
