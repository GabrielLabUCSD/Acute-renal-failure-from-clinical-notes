The patient has been on medication to control his blood pressure and blood sugar levels, with good control of both.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent preoperative testing, including blood work, a chest x-ray, and an electrocardiogram. His labs were within normal limits, including a hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%. The chest x-ray revealed no significant abnormalities, and the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

During the procedure, the patient was placed under general anesthesia. The surgery went smoothly without any complications. The patient received prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively as per standard protocol. He was monitored closely throughout the procedure, with stable vital signs noted.

Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for close observation. He recovered well from anesthesia and was appropriately responsive. Pain management was initiated with intravenous opioids, and the patient's pain was well-controlled. He was also provided with deep breathing and coughing exercises to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications.

In the postoperative period, the patient was encouraged to ambulate early to promote recovery and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. Physical therapy was consulted to assist with mobilization and strengthening exercises. The patient was monitored closely for any signs of infection, such as fever or increased redness and swelling at the surgical site.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no major complications noted. His vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of infection. He progressed well with pain management and achieved good control with oral analgesics. The intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours as per protocol, as there were no signs of infection.

The patient was discharged home three days post-surgery. He was provided with instructions for wound care, signs of infection to watch for, and a plan for pain management. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his chronic medical conditions.

During the follow-up appointment, the patient reported an improvement in his surgical site pain and ability to perform daily activities. The wound appeared to be healing well without signs of infection. The patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels remained well-controlled, and there were no medication adjustments required.

In summary, this 65-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia underwent a successful hernia repair surgery.
