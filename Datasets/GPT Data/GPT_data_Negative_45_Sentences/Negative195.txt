Patient Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a complex medical history, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been managed with multiple antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics, to control his blood pressure. His diabetes is well controlled with oral hypoglycemic medications.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient also has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which he takes statins. He has a family history of coronary artery disease and has had a previous myocardial infarction. As a result of this, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) three years ago and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then.

The patient also has a known history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50 mL/min/1.73m². His renal function has been stable over the years, and he has been monitored regularly by a nephrologist. There is no evidence of acute renal failure.

During preoperative assessments, the patient has been found to be otherwise healthy, with a well-controlled blood pressure and stable glycemic levels. His preoperative laboratory studies, including complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, were all within normal limits.

The patient’s surgical procedure is scheduled for tomorrow, and detailed discussions have been held regarding the surgical risks, benefits, and possible complications. The patient has provided informed consent for the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. His vital signs remained stable, and he was managed for pain control with intravenous analgesics. Monitoring for any signs of infection, such as fever or wound site redness, was performed diligently.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was started on oral pain medications. He was encouraged to ambulate to prevent complications such as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Mild postoperative swelling was noted, which was managed with elevation and compression stockings.

The patient received regular follow-up with his primary care physician and surgeon in the weeks following the surgery. He was advised to watch for any signs of wound infection or dehiscence. Appropriate wound care was implemented to promote healing.

At the postoperative visit, the patient presented with no major complications. His wound had healed well, with no signs of infection. The patient reported mild incisional pain, which was managed with over-the-counter analgesics. No signs of postoperative bleeding or hematoma were observed.

In conclusion, the patient's medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, CKD stage 3, and previous CABG. Preoperatively, his conditions were well controlled, and laboratory tests were within normal limits. After an uneventful surgical procedure, the patient had a smooth postoperative course with no major complications. The patient is recovering well without any signs of acute renal failure.
