He will be monitored closely throughout the procedure, including continuous ECG, oxygen saturation monitoring, and blood pressure monitoring. 

A central venous catheter and arterial line will not be required. 

The surgery is estimated to take approximately two hours. 

Postoperatively, the patient will be monitored in the recovery area for the initial few hours before being transferred to a surgical ward. 

He will receive intravenous fluids initially and will be transitioned to the oral route as tolerated. 

The patient will be started on prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infections.
