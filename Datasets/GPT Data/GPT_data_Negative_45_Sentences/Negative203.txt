The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an enlarged prostate. He has a significant medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been on antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years and his blood pressure is well controlled. He takes a statin medication for his hyperlipidemia. His diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and he does not require insulin or oral antidiabetic medications.

The patient's preoperative laboratory results show normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits. His fasting blood glucose is slightly elevated at 150 mg/dL, but his HbA1c level is 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control. He is not on any medications that affect coagulation, and his coagulation profile is normal.

On physical examination, the patient has an enlarged prostate with a palpable mass on rectal examination. He does not exhibit any signs of urinary obstruction, such as distended bladder or hydronephrosis. His cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are unremarkable. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 28, suggesting he is overweight but not obese.

In terms of prior surgeries, the patient had an appendectomy when he was 20 years old, and an inguinal hernia repair at the age of 50. Both surgeries were uneventful, and he had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He has no known drug allergies.

As part of the preoperative evaluation, the patient undergoes an echocardiogram, which reveals mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved systolic function. Other cardiac parameters are within normal limits. The patient is deemed to be at low risk for cardiac complications during surgery.

The plan for the patient's surgery is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). He has been informed about the procedure, its risks and benefits, and has provided informed consent. The patient understands the need for postoperative catheterization and the possibility of temporary urinary incontinence.

After the surgery, the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). He is monitored closely for vital signs, pain level, and urine output. The patient does not experience any intraoperative complications, and the surgical procedure was successful in relieving the obstruction caused by the enlarged prostate.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remain stable, and his pain is well controlled. He is started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections. The patient is able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulates without difficulty. The Foley catheter remains in place for continuous bladder drainage.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's vital signs remain stable, and his pain continues to be well controlled. He is encouraged to increase his fluid intake and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia. The patient's urine output is within normal limits.

The patient's Foley catheter is removed on the second postoperative day. He is able to void spontaneously without difficulty. He is instructed to monitor his urine output and report any signs of urinary retention to the healthcare provider. The patient is discharged home with appropriate discharge instructions, including the need for follow-up appointments.

During the postoperative course, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or urinary retention. He does not require any additional interventions or readmissions to the hospital. The patient's postoperative course is uncomplicated.

In summary, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with an enlarged prostate and is planned for a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Preoperative evaluation shows normal renal function, and the patient is at low risk for cardiac complications during surgery. The surgery is successful in relieving the obstruction caused by the enlarged prostate. The patient's immediate postoperative course is uneventful, with stable vital signs, well-controlled pain, and appropriate diet and ambulation. The Foley catheter is removed on the second postoperative day, and the patient is discharged home without complications.
