The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has a sedentary lifestyle and is an ex-smoker of 10 years. The patient has been experiencing worsening chest pain and shortness of breath and has been scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery.

In the past, the patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement and has been taking antiplatelet medications regularly. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago for which he received thrombolytic therapy. The patient also has a history of left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45%.

His blood pressure has been well controlled on a combination of antihypertensive medications, and his diabetes is managed with diet and metformin. The patient has a history of dyslipidemia and is on statin therapy to control his cholesterol levels.

Before the surgery, the patient underwent a preoperative evaluation which included a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram. These tests showed mild anemia and stable renal function with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient was advised to discontinue his antiplatelet medications a week before the surgery and was started on low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis. His glycemic control was optimized, and he received counseling on the importance of smoking cessation.

During the surgery, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, and a quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting procedure was performed. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively.

In the immediate postoperative course, the patient required mechanical ventilation for 24 hours. He was extubated successfully, and his vital signs remained stable. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed briefly to support his left ventricular function but was removed after 48 hours.

The patient was started on aspirin therapy to prevent graft thrombosis and continued on his antihypertensive and anti-diabetic medications. His postoperative recovery was unremarkable, and he was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day.

During the follow-up visits, the patient complained of mild chest discomfort and underwent an exercise stress test, which showed no significant evidence of myocardial ischemia. His wound healed well without any signs of infection, and his renal function remained stable.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he made good progress in his recovery. He was advised to continue with regular exercise, maintain a healthy diet, and adhere to his medication regimen for optimal management of his cardiovascular risk factors.

It is important to note that the patient did not develop any acute renal failure during his postoperative course. However, specific complications other than acute renal failure were not mentioned in the medical history provided.
