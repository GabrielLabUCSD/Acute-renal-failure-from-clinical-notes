The patient in question is planning to undergo surgery and has an extensive medical history. They are a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been taking metoprolol succinate, lisinopril, amlodipine, metformin, and atorvastatin for management of their chronic conditions.

In terms of surgical history, the patient previously underwent a cholecystectomy ten years ago without any complications. They also had a left inguinal hernia repair two years ago, which was uneventful. The patient does not have a history of blood transfusions or any known allergies.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a baseline hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, platelet count of 250,000/μL, and a white blood cell count of 7,000/μL. The comprehensive metabolic panel reveals normal liver function tests, with a total bilirubin level of 0.8 mg/dL, AST and ALT levels within normal limits, and an alkaline phosphatase level of 60 U/L. The patient's renal function is stable, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 mL/min/1.73m².

Cardiac evaluation shows an ejection fraction of 55% without evidence of significant valvular disease on echocardiogram. The patient had a recent stress test, which demonstrated no signs of myocardial ischemia. Their blood pressure is well-controlled, with a recent reading of 128/76 mmHg.

The patient's pulmonary function tests indicate normal spirometry results, with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 4.2L and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 3.8L. Their oxygen saturation is consistently above 95% on room air.

Regarding the patient's perioperative management, they will receive prophylactic antibiotics based on surgical guidelines. Additionally, the patient will be closely monitored perioperatively for blood pressure control with medications if necessary. Blood glucose will be monitored and managed in the operating room to maintain euglycemia. The patient's antihypertensive medications will be continued the morning of surgery with a sip of water.

Postoperatively, the patient will be monitored in the recovery room for any signs of respiratory distress or pain. Adequate pain control will be provided through a multimodal approach, which may include opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local anesthetics. Early ambulation will be encouraged to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

In terms of the patient's postoperative course, they recovered well without any complications. Their pain was well-controlled, and they were able to tolerate oral intake the day after surgery. The patient passed gas and had a bowel movement postoperatively, indicating the return of gastrointestinal function. They were able to ambulate independently, and their vital signs remained stable.

Overall, the patient's surgery was successful, and there were no notable complications encountered during their postoperative course. The patient is expected to have a smooth recovery and be discharged to home within the next few days.
