Patient is a 67-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with complaints of worsening knee pain and difficulty walking, resulting in a significant decrease in his quality of life. After a thorough evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis of the right knee and decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient was evaluated by the anesthesia team, who determined him to be at moderate risk for surgery due to his comorbidities. Preoperative laboratory results were within normal limits, and an electrocardiogram showed no significant abnormalities. The patient's medications were temporarily adjusted, and he was counseled on the importance of glycemic control and blood pressure management prior to surgery. 

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and the procedure was uneventful. The orthopedic surgeon successfully replaced the patient's right knee joint with a prosthetic implant. There were no intraoperative complications reported. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of infection, bleeding, or thrombosis.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient received continuous intravenous analgesia, which effectively controlled his pain. He was started on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in the form of low molecular weight heparin injections. Physical therapy was initiated on the day of surgery to minimize joint stiffness and promote early mobility. The patient was encouraged to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain gradually improved, and he experienced significant functional improvement. He was able to bear weight on the operated leg with minimal discomfort. In the absence of any signs of infection or wound complications, the patient's surgical wound was deemed healing satisfactorily. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and his antihypertensive medications were gradually resumed. 

The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day with a prescription for oral analgesics for pain management. He was advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient and attend follow-up appointments with the orthopedic surgeon. The patient was educated on signs and symptoms of wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. 

During the postoperative course, the patient did not experience any complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, he did not develop any cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. His glycemic control remained stable, and his blood pressure was well-managed. He demonstrated excellent compliance with the prescribed medication regimen and attended all follow-up appointments. 

At the one-month postoperative visit, the patient reported a significant improvement in his quality of life. He was able to walk without pain and resume his activities of daily living. The surgical wound had completely healed without any signs of infection. The physical therapist noted remarkable progress in the patient's range of motion and strength. 

In conclusion, this 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia underwent an uneventful total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course with no complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He experienced significant pain relief and functional improvement. The patient demonstrated excellent compliance and achieved a satisfactory outcome with improved quality of life.
