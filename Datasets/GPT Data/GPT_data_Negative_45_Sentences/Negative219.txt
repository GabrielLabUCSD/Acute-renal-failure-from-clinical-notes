The patient is a 50-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, who is planning to undergo surgery for repair of an inguinal hernia.
The hypertension is well-controlled with Lisinopril 10mg daily, and the hyperlipidemia is managed with Atorvastatin 40mg daily. The patient's blood pressure has been consistently stable with average readings of 130/80 mmHg, and his lipid panel is within normal limits.
He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago and has been managing it with Metformin 1000mg BID. His hemoglobin A1c level has been stable around 7%, and he has no recent history of hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient had a routine preoperative visit with the surgeon, who mentioned the potential risks of surgery, including infection, bleeding, and the rare possibility of needing additional procedures. The patient was educated on the importance of diligent wound care and infection prevention.
In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy at age 30 without any complications. No significant anesthesia-related complications or adverse reactions have been reported in the past.
On physical examination, the patient is in no acute distress. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no palpable masses or organomegaly.
Routine preoperative laboratory tests, including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. His renal function tests showed a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ².
The patient has a history of smoking ten cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. He reported a smoking cessation attempt five years ago but was unsuccessful. The surgeon advised him to quit smoking to reduce the risk of complications such as delayed wound healing and respiratory issues postoperatively.
The patient has a supportive family and will have a designated caregiver following the surgery. He has been instructed about postoperative dietary modifications and restrictions but has no known allergies to any medications or substances used in the perioperative period.
The patient consented to surgery and received preoperative prophylactic antibiotics according to institutional guidelines. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia without any reported intraoperative complications. The estimated blood loss was minimal, and no blood transfusions were required.
Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or malignant hyperthermia. He tolerated oral intake and reported good pain control with the prescribed analgesics.
Wound care instructions were provided to the patient and his caregiver, emphasizing the importance of maintaining cleanliness and avoiding any undue stress on the incision site. They were also educated about signs of infection to watch for, such as redness, swelling, warmth, and discharge.
The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 1 with prescriptions for pain medication and instructions to follow up with the surgeon in two weeks for wound assessment. He was advised to gradually resume normal activities, avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous exercises for the first few weeks.
There were no immediate postoperative complications reported in the patient's medical record. The surgical incision appeared well-approximated, with no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. He did not report any significant postoperative pain or adverse reactions to the prescribed medications.
During his two-week follow-up visit, the patient reported some mild postoperative discomfort, which was expected, but no red flags for infection. The surgeon noted satisfactory wound healing and no evidence of hernia recurrence on physical examination. The patient was encouraged to continue smoking cessation efforts and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
The patient's overall postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any major complications such as surgical site infection, hematoma, seroma, or wound dehiscence. His blood pressure remained stable, and there were no signs of uncontrolled diabetes or hyperlipidemia during the follow-up period.
He continued to take his medications as prescribed, with no reported adverse effects or drug interactions. He was referred to a smoking cessation program for further support in quitting smoking.
In conclusion, the patient underwent successful surgery for repair of an inguinal hernia without any immediate or delayed complications. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he demonstrated appropriate wound healing and resolution of postoperative discomfort. The patient's preexisting medical conditions were well-managed, and he received appropriate perioperative care to optimize outcomes. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine monitoring of his chronic conditions and encouraged to make lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, for better overall health.
