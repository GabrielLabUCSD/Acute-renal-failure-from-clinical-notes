24. The healthcare team will monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, and urine output.
25. The patient will be encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to prevent atelectasis.
26. He will follow a clear liquid diet initially and progress to solid food as tolerated.
27. The patient will be discharged once his pain is controlled, he is able to walk with assistance, and his vital signs are stable.
28. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled for suture or staple removal and wound assessment.
29. The surgical team will ensure appropriate postoperative wound care, including wound dressing changes and keeping the incision clean and dry.
30. The patient will be educated on signs and symptoms of infection and advised to contact his healthcare provider if they occur.

42. He had no in-hospital falls or other physical accidents.
43. The patient did not require any blood transfusions during the perioperative period.
44. There were no known drug interactions or allergic reactions during the patient's hospital stay.
45. The patient was discharged to home in stable condition without any ongoing complications related to the surgery.
