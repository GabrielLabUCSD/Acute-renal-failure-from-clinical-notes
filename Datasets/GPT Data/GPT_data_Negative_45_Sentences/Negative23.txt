The patient is a 55-year-old man who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension for which he takes amlodipine. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is managed with metformin and insulin. Other medical comorbidities include hyperlipidemia, for which he takes atorvastatin, and osteoarthritis, which is managed with acetaminophen and occasional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy done 10 years ago and a knee arthroscopy for meniscal repair 2 years ago. He had an uneventful recovery from both surgeries without any reported complications. The patient has no known allergies to medications or latex.

During the preoperative evaluation, it was noted that he has a smoking history of 20 pack-years. Despite being advised numerous times to quit, the patient continues to smoke. His vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormal findings.

Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL, normal white blood cell count, and a fasting blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL. Kidney function tests demonstrated a serum creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, corresponding to an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 70 mL/min/1.73mÂ². No electrolyte imbalances or abnormalities were noted.

The patient was advised to stop smoking for at least two weeks before the surgery to reduce the risk of complications. Additionally, he was instructed to continue taking his antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications as usual. The patient was provided with information on preoperative fasting and bowel preparation, ensuring clear communication and understanding of the surgical procedure and postoperative care.

The surgery, which was scheduled as an elective procedure, was performed without any complications. The patient was kept under general anesthesia during the surgery and was monitored closely with continuous vital sign monitoring. A urinary catheter was inserted intraoperatively to monitor urine output accurately.

After the surgery, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where he was closely monitored for recovery from anesthesia and pain control. He was started on antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections. The patient was encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced moderate pain, which was managed with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics, including opioids and non-opioid medications. The patient was encouraged to use incentive spirometry regularly to prevent respiratory complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia.

During the hospital stay, the patient's blood pressure remained stable, and his blood glucose levels were closely monitored and managed with sliding scale insulin. Wound care was performed regularly to ensure proper healing and prevention of infection.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 3. He was provided with clear instructions regarding wound care, medications, and the importance of adherence to a diabetic diet. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for one week after discharge to assess wound healing and evaluate the need for further rehabilitation.

No complications such as infection, hemorrhage, or wound dehiscence were reported during the postoperative period. However, the patient continued to smoke despite counseling and the information provided regarding the increased risk of surgical site complications and delayed wound healing associated with smoking.

In conclusion, the patient, a 55-year-old man, was admitted for surgery and had an uneventful procedure and postoperative course. He had a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. No acute renal failure was observed. The patient was advised to quit smoking, and his comorbidities were managed appropriately during the hospital stay. Clear instructions were provided for his discharge planning, and a follow-up appointment was scheduled to ensure optimal recovery.
