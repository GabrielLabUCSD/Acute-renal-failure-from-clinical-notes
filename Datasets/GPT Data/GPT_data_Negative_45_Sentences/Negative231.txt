The results showed [normal/inrange/out-of-range] values for all parameters tested. The patient's renal function, as indicated by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), falls within the normal range, suggesting no renal impairment.

The patient has a history of [surgical procedure 1] performed [years] ago, which was uneventful with no reported complications.

Pain management was initiated utilizing a multimodal approach to minimize discomfort and promote early mobilization.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with regular monitoring of vital signs, wound healing, and pain control. Physical therapy was initiated promptly to prevent postoperative complications and promote early mobility and independence. Ambulation progress was satisfactory with the patient reaching the desired functional milestones.

Surveillance for potential postoperative complications, such as infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE), was carried out in accordance with established protocols. No signs of infection, venous thromboembolism (VTE), or wound dehiscence were noted during the hospital stay.
