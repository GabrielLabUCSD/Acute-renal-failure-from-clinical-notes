Patient X is a 60-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a chronic knee injury. He has a history of hypertension, controlled with medication. The patient reports occasional episodes of shortness of breath, especially during physical exertion, which prompted an evaluation for possible underlying heart disease.

In the past, the patient was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and underwent a coronary angioplasty with stent placement. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy, consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel, as part of his cardiovascular management. His echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50%, indicating a mildly reduced heart function.

Regarding respiratory health, he was a long-term smoker but quit 10 years ago. A recent chest X-ray showed mild emphysematous changes, but no active pulmonary infection or findings suggestive of lung cancer. Pulmonary function tests indicated mild obstruction consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has been managed with a bronchodilator inhaler.

His other chronic conditions, apart from hypertension and COPD, include type 2 diabetes, which is well-controlled with oral medication. The patient underwent a recent eye examination due to intermittent visual disturbances and was diagnosed with mild cataracts but no retinopathy.

In terms of his surgical history, he previously had an appendectomy and hernia repair surgery, both of which were uneventful. The patient reported tolerating anesthesia well during these procedures.

During the preoperative evaluation, routine laboratory tests were performed, which revealed mild abnormalities. Specifically, his renal function was mildly impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 55 mL/min/1.73m². However, he has no history of acute renal failure and his renal function has remained stable over the years.

An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities, and a preoperative cardiology consultation confirmed the patient to be at low risk for cardiac complications during surgery. To further assess his cardiovascular fitness, a stress test was performed, which showed good exercise capacity without significant ischemic changes.

The patient was counseled extensively preoperatively on the importance of maintaining his medications throughout the perioperative period and was advised to withhold his antiplatelet therapy for a specified timeframe before the surgery, with approval from his cardiologist.

Following the surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He experienced mild pain, which was effectively managed with non-opioid analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated early to aid in the recovery of his knee function. Although he required minimal assistance with ambulation during the initial days following surgery, he gradually regained his independence.

There were no postoperative complications related to his cardiovascular system. Regular monitoring of his blood pressure revealed no significant fluctuations. The patient's respiratory status remained stable, with no signs of exacerbation of his underlying COPD. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use his inhaler as needed.

Blood work, including renal function tests, was repeated postoperatively, and no significant deteriorations were observed. Although his creatinine level remained mildly elevated, the eGFR remained relatively stable at 56 mL/min/1.73m².

In summary, Patient X, a 60-year-old male, presented with chronic knee injury requiring surgery. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease with stent placement, COPD, and type 2 diabetes. His preoperative evaluation indicated well-managed chronic conditions, with stable renal function and cardiovascular fitness. The surgical procedure was successful, and his postoperative course was uneventful, without complications such as acute renal failure. The patient continues to follow up for rehabilitation and monitoring of his chronic conditions.
