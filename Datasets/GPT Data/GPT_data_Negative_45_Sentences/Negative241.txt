The patient in question is a 52-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite these conditions, his blood pressure, lipid levels, and blood glucose have been well controlled with medications. The patientâ€™s surgical history includes an appendectomy performed 20 years ago and a hernia repair surgery 10 years ago, both of which were uneventful.

In terms of his social history, he is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally, but not excessively. He has never used illicit drugs. The patient works as a teacher and has a sedentary lifestyle. However, he tries to walk for 30 minutes every day to maintain some level of physical activity.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's physical examination was within normal limits. His cardiac examination revealed regular heart sounds and no murmurs or gallops. Pulmonary auscultation was clear, with no adventitious sounds noted. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no evidence of organomegaly or masses. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves and normal strength and sensation in all extremities.

Laboratory investigations showed a complete blood count within normal range, with no evidence of anemia or infection. Renal function tests were within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Liver function tests were also within normal range. Fasting blood glucose levels were well controlled, with a hemoglobin A1C of 6.4%. Lipid profile revealed total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 105 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 120 mg/dL. Preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm.

The patient was deemed suitable for surgery by both the surgeon and anesthesiologist. He was instructed to stop taking his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications the night before the procedure, as per preoperative instructions.

The patient underwent the scheduled surgery without any complications. He tolerated anesthesia well and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. The surgical team reported that the operation was uneventful, with no unexpected findings or complications.

Regarding the patient's postoperative course, he was initially managed in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring. His vital signs remained within normal limits, and he was able to ambulate with minimal assistance. The patient's pain was managed adequately with analgesics, and he reported good pain control. He followed the prescribed postoperative diet and consumed clear fluids without any difficulty.

The patient's recovery was smooth, and he was transferred to the surgical ward the following day. He continued to progress well, with no signs of infection, wound complications, or respiratory distress. The surgical wound was clean and dry, and there was no evidence of dehiscence or drainage. His bowel and bladder function returned to normal. The patient was encouraged to continue ambulating and performing deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient remained stable, with no adverse events reported. His blood pressure was well controlled, and his blood glucose levels were within the target range. On the third postoperative day, he was discharged home with appropriate postoperative care instructions. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks and with the surgeon for a wound check in one week.

In summary, this 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent a smooth surgery without any intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications.
