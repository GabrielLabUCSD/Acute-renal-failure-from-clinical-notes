He takes medications including Lisinopril, Simvastatin, and Metformin for these conditions. The patient has been generally healthy and has not required any hospitalizations in the past.

The patient's surgical history is notable for an appendectomy 20 years ago, which was uneventful. There have been no complications or issues since then. The patient does not have any known drug allergies or sensitivities.

In terms of social history, the patient is a non-smoker, but does consume alcohol occasionally. He works in an office setting and is generally active, engaging in regular exercise such as walking and swimming.

The patient will undergo a left knee replacement surgery. He has had chronic knee pain and decreased mobility for several years. Conservative management with physical therapy and pain medications has been unsuccessful in alleviating his symptoms. Therefore, he has opted for surgical intervention to improve his quality of life.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough medical evaluation, including blood tests and imaging studies. His blood pressure and blood sugar levels were well-controlled within target ranges. His renal function was normal, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's surgical team deemed him appropriate for the procedure and cleared him for surgery.

The surgery was performed without any complications, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He was placed on intraoperative antibiotics and the incision was closed with staples. The surgical team also provided appropriate pain management postoperatively.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. Vital signs were stable, and he received intravenous fluids and pain medications as needed. The patient was instructed on how to perform breathing exercises, leg exercises, and use of an incentive spirometer to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

The patient was started on a course of physical therapy early in his recovery period. The physical therapy sessions included exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee joint and promote range of motion. The patient was also educated on the importance of pain management, wound care, and adherence to the prescribed medications.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not develop any signs of infection or other postoperative complications. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count and renal function tests, were within normal limits. The patient's pain was well-controlled with oral pain medications, and he was able to mobilize with the assistance of a physical therapist.

Following a successful recovery in the hospital, the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3. He was provided with a prescription for pain medications and instructions for wound care. The patient was advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient for further rehabilitation.

In the outpatient setting, the patient demonstrated steady progress in his recovery. He attended physical therapy sessions regularly and reported improvement in pain levels and mobility. He actively participated in his rehabilitation program and followed all recommendations regarding exercise, gait training, and weight-bearing restrictions.

During a follow-up visit 6 weeks post-surgery, the patient showed significant improvement in knee function and reported minimal pain while performing daily activities. The surgical incision was well-healed with no signs of infection or complications. The patient's physical therapist recommended continuing with a maintenance exercise program to further enhance his knee strength and joint stability.

In summary, the patient underwent a left knee replacement surgery for chronic knee pain and limited mobility. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient had a smooth postoperative course. He was discharged home on postoperative day 3 and continued rehabilitation as an outpatient. The patient demonstrated good progress and no complications were noted. He achieved improved knee function, reduced pain, and regained independence in his daily activities.
