The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period. Intravenous pain medications were administered as needed, and the patient reported adequate pain relief.

The patient's respiratory status was monitored closely to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis. Incentive spirometry was initiated, and the patient demonstrated good compliance and effort.

To prevent deep vein thrombosis, the patient received prophylactic anticoagulation in the form of subcutaneous heparin or low molecular weight heparin depending on the surgical procedure and bleeding risks. Sequential compression devices were also applied to the lower extremities.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, with a gradual improvement in pain control and overall well-being. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of infection or wound complications.

No complications were noted during the postoperative assessment, and the patient's recovery was deemed uneventful. There were no signs of surgical site infection, wound dehiscence, or any other surgical complications. The patient was discharged home with a plan for close outpatient follow-up to ensure continued recovery and management of chronic conditions.

In conclusion, the patient had a successful surgery and an unremarkable postoperative course. The patient's chronic medical conditions were well-managed, and there were no complications during the hospital stay.
