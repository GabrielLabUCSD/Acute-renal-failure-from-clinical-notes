The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and asthma. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years and his blood pressure has been well-controlled. His diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet modification. The patient reports occasional episodes of wheezing, for which he uses a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler as needed.

In terms of surgeries, the patient had undergone cholecystectomy 5 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uncomplicated, and he had a normal postoperative course. There were no concerns regarding anesthesia or wound healing, and the patient recovered well without any immediate postoperative complications.

The patient's surgical history also includes a knee arthroscopy for a meniscal tear 2 years ago. He had a brief period of postoperative pain, which was managed with oral analgesics, and his recovery was uneventful. No complications, such as infection or joint stiffness, were reported, and the patient regained full function of his knee.

Regarding allergies, the patient has a documented allergy to penicillin, with a reported rash following prior exposure. He has not experienced any anaphylactic reactions or other adverse effects with other antibiotics and is able to tolerate medications in the cephalosporin class without any issues.

In terms of smoking history, the patient is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago. He used to smoke a pack a day for over 20 years. However, since quitting, he has not experienced any significant respiratory symptoms or exacerbations of his asthma.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of acute distress, and his lung auscultation reveals equal breath sounds bilaterally without any wheezing or adventitious sounds.

Laboratory results show his blood glucose levels within the target range, with HbA1c of 6.5%. His renal function tests, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, are normal, indicating no evidence of kidney dysfunction. All other routine blood work, including complete blood count and coagulation profile, are within normal limits.

The patient's surgical plan involves general anesthesia, and the anesthesiologist has reviewed his medical history, ensuring that appropriate precautions will be taken during the procedure. The patient has been advised to continue taking his regular medications, with the exception of oral hypoglycemics, which have been held on the morning of surgery. The surgical team will take necessary measures to prevent surgical site infection, such as proper preoperative skin preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis.

Regarding the postoperative course, the patient will be monitored closely in the recovery unit, ensuring adequate pain control, vital signs stability, and appropriate wound care. The nursing staff will assist the patient with early mobilization and breathing exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis or respiratory infections. The patient will receive appropriate postoperative instructions and follow-up appointments for wound care and suture removal.

Following prior surgeries, this patient has not experienced any acute renal failure as a complication. However, in the postoperative period, he may be at risk for potential complications such as wound infection, postoperative pain, respiratory complications (including asthma exacerbation or atelectasis), postoperative ileus, or venous thromboembolism. The surgical team will closely monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of these complications and take prompt action if needed. However, it is worth noting that acute renal failure is not a typical complication associated with the type of surgery being performed in this case.
