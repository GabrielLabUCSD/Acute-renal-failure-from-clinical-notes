The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on medication for his conditions, including an ACE inhibitor and a statin. The patient has had a previous surgical procedure five years ago for appendicitis, which was uncomplicated.

He presents to the hospital with complaints of severe abdominal pain and is diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. After an evaluation, the decision is made to proceed with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to the severity of his symptoms and the risk of complications associated with conservative management.

Prior to surgery, the patient's preoperative evaluation includes routine blood work, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and metabolic panel. The results of these tests are within normal limits. An ultrasound is also performed to confirm the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and rule out any other pathology. The patient is found to have multiple gallstones and a thickened gallbladder wall.

The patient is scheduled for surgery the following day and undergoes a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The surgery lasts approximately one hour, and the patient is placed under general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The gallbladder is removed without any complications, and the surgical site is closed using absorbable sutures.

During the postoperative course, the patient is initially monitored in the recovery room for any immediate complications. He is started on intravenous fluids and pain medication to manage postoperative pain. The patient is encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain gradually improves, and he is transitioned from intravenous pain medication to oral pain medication. He is started on a clear liquid diet and advances to a regular diet as tolerated. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with no signs of infection or fever.

On postoperative day four, the patient is discharged home with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks. He is prescribed a short course of oral antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. The patient is advised to continue his regular medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

During the postoperative period, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or bile leaks. His laboratory values, including liver function tests, remain within normal limits. The patient is educated on signs and symptoms to watch for post-discharge, such as increasing abdominal pain, jaundice, or fever, and is advised to seek medical attention if any of these occur.

Overall, the patient's surgical procedure for acute cholecystitis goes well, with an uneventful postoperative period. The patient follows up with his primary care physician as scheduled, and his recovery progresses without any further complications. The surgical intervention successfully resolves the patient's symptoms, and he reports improved quality of life after the surgery.
