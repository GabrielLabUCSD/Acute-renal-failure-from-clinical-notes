Patient X, a 58-year-old male, is scheduled to undergo surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. His medical history reveals that he has experienced hypertension for the past 10 years, well-controlled with medications. He is also a former smoker, having quit 15 years ago after smoking for 20 years. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases, with both parents suffering from myocardial infarctions in their 60s.

Further examination of Patient X's medical history shows that he has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 6 years. His diabetes is managed with lifestyle modifications and oral hypoglycemic medications. He has no previous history of diabetic complications or hospitalizations related to his diabetes.

Despite a sedentary job, Patient X reports engaging in regular exercise, such as brisk walking, to maintain his cardiovascular health. His BMI is within the normal range, and he has no known allergies to medications or prior adverse reactions to anesthesia.

In terms of medications, Patient X takes lisinopril for his hypertension, metformin for his diabetes, and a daily multivitamin. He also takes low-dose aspirin as a preventative measure for cardiovascular disease. His blood pressure is consistently in the range of 130/80 mmHg, and his most recent HbA1c level was 6.5%.

Upon physical examination, Patient X appears to be in good overall health, with no significant findings on cardiopulmonary auscultation. His abdominal examination reveals a reducible inguinal hernia, causing mild discomfort and occasional pain during physical activities.

Laboratory test results show a normal complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. Electrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm, and an echocardiogram demonstrates preserved left ventricular systolic function.

Patient X undergoes the planned inguinal hernia repair surgery successfully under general anesthesia. The surgical procedure lasts an uneventful 45 minutes, and a mesh is used to reinforce the hernia repair. Intraoperative blood loss is minimal, and no transfusions are required.

In the immediate postoperative period, Patient X is monitored closely for pain management, vital signs, and wound healing. He reports moderate incisional pain, which is effectively managed with opioid analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. His blood pressure remains stable, and there are no signs of postoperative bleeding or infection at the surgical site.

Patient X shows good progress in his recovery, with normal bowel function resuming within 24 hours post-surgery. His oral intake is gradually increased, and he tolerates a regular diet without nausea or vomiting. On postoperative day 2, he is able to ambulate independently without assistance and is compliant with deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's incision site appears clean with no signs of erythema, swelling, or discharge. The surgical wound is healing well, with intact sutures and no signs of wound dehiscence. Adequate dressing is applied to protect the incision, and wound care instructions are given to the patient.

Patient X's postoperative course remains unremarkable, and he is discharged on postoperative day 3 with appropriate pain medication prescriptions and instructions for wound care. He is advised to gradually resume his regular activities, avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous exercise for the first few weeks.

During the follow-up visit scheduled at two weeks post-discharge, Patient X reports no significant issues or complications related to the surgery. His incision shows complete healing, with no signs of infection or inflammation. He no longer requires opioid analgesics for pain relief and expresses satisfaction with the surgical outcome.

In summary, Patient X has a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. He is a former smoker but has been leading a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and good control of his medical conditions. His inguinal hernia repair surgery was successful, with no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications observed. His recovery has been unremarkable, and he is healing well without any signs of infection or wound complications.
