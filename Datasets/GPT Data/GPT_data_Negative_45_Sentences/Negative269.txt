The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. He is currently on medications including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin to manage these conditions. The patient has no known drug allergies.

He presented with complaints of worsening knee pain and mobility difficulties due to osteoarthritis. Physical examination revealed crepitus of the knee joint and decreased range of motion. X-rays confirmed severe degenerative changes, and conservative management including physical therapy and analgesics have been unsuccessful in alleviating his symptoms.

After discussing the benefits and risks, the patient has now opted for knee replacement surgery. The preoperative laboratory evaluation revealed a normal complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, hepatic function panel, and coagulation profile. His electrocardiogram showed a regular sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient underwent a right inguinal hernia repair two years ago without any complications. Additionally, he had a wisdom tooth extraction and a tonsillectomy in his childhood, and both procedures were uneventful.

The patient was advised to discontinue his metformin prior to the surgery to mitigate the risk of lactic acidosis. He was instructed to continue all other medications, including his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, on the morning of the surgery with a sip of water.

On the day of surgery, an intravenous line was established, and the patient was placed under general anesthesia. The procedure involved a total knee replacement, which was performed without any intraoperative complications. The estimated blood loss was minimal, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and closely monitored. He was provided with appropriate pain management and started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization and joint range of motion.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, with no signs of wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia. His pain was well controlled with a combination of oral analgesics and local joint injections, and he demonstrated gradual improvement in knee function.

Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and ensure adequate rehabilitation. During the follow-up visits, his surgical wound was inspected for signs of healing, and he was assessed for any complications, such as prosthetic loosening or joint instability.

Overall, the patient had a successful knee replacement surgery and experienced a smooth recovery without any major postoperative complications. He adhered to the prescribed physical therapy regimen and reported progressive improvement in pain relief and functional capacity.

With appropriate medical management and a diligent rehabilitation program, the patient regained normal mobility and returned to his regular activities of daily living. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and did not report any issues or concerns with the prosthetic joint or the operated limb.

In conclusion, the 65-year-old male patient underwent an uneventful knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis. He had a favorable postoperative course without any complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia. The patient's pain was effectively managed, and his functional capacity improved over time, allowing him to resume his normal activities.
