Prior to surgery, he underwent extensive preoperative evaluations, including a thorough physical examination, blood workup, and imaging studies. All investigations showed no significant abnormalities, and the patient was deemed suitable for surgery.

During the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, were stable and within normal limits. The surgical wound was monitored for signs of infection, with daily assessments revealing no alarming changes.

Pain management was initiated post-surgery, with the patient receiving a combination of analgesics, including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This multimodal approach effectively controlled the patient's pain, allowing him to ambulate and perform activities of daily living comfortably.
