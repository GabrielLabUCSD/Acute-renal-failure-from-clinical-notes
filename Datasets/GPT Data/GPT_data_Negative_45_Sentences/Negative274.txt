The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past five years and is currently on lisinopril 20mg once daily. His diabetes is controlled with metformin 1000mg twice daily. The patient reports a body mass index (BMI) of 32, indicating obesity.

The patient has a surgical history of cholecystectomy ten years ago without any complications. He presents today for preoperative evaluation before undergoing a scheduled open hernia repair surgery. The patient reports experiencing intermittent pain and discomfort in the abdominal area, especially when lifting heavy objects. His primary care physician recommended surgery after a physical examination and an ultrasound confirmed the presence of a hernia.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a reducible hernia in the right groin area, measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter. The patient denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations. His laboratory results show a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, HbA1c of 6.8%, and a normal complete blood count and renal function panel.

The patient is scheduled to have an open hernia repair procedure under general anesthesia. The surgeon explains the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for infection, bleeding, and recurrence of the hernia. The patient gives informed consent and is instructed to stop taking his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications 24 hours before the surgery.

Following the surgery, the patient is observed in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for a couple of hours and is then transferred to the surgical ward. He is given analgesics for pain management and is encouraged to ambulate as tolerated. The patient's vital signs are monitored regularly, and his incision site is checked for signs of infection.

In the postoperative period, the patient's blood pressure remains stable, and his blood glucose levels are well controlled. He is started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. The patient's pain is well-managed with oral analgesics, and he reports minimal discomfort during movement.

On postoperative day 2, the patient develops a low-grade fever (100.4Â°F) and reports increased redness and swelling around the surgical incision. The surgical team suspects a superficial wound infection and orders a wound culture. The patient is started on empiric antibiotics pending culture results.

The wound culture reveals the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient's antibiotic regimen is adjusted accordingly. Wound care is intensified, including daily dressing changes and regular cleaning with topical antiseptics. The patient's fever subsides, and the redness and swelling gradually improve over the next few days.

Despite the wound infection, the patient's recovery progresses well, and he is discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5. He is given a prescription for a 10-day course of oral antibiotics to complete at home. The patient is advised to follow up with his surgeon in two weeks for a wound check and to discuss postoperative physical therapy for strengthening the abdominal muscles.

In summary, the 65-year-old male patient with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity presents for preoperative evaluation before an open hernia repair surgery. His medical conditions are well controlled. The patient undergoes the surgery without complications and has a postoperative course marked by a superficial wound infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The infection is successfully treated with antibiotics and wound care, and the patient is discharged home with a favorable prognosis.
