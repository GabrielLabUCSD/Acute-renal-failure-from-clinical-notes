The patient is a 56-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. His blood pressure has been well-controlled on medications, and his diabetes is managed with diet and exercise. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father experiencing a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.

The patient has never undergone any surgeries before, and there are no known drug allergies. He is currently taking lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. His blood pressure is typically around 130/80 mmHg, and his blood glucose levels are under good control with an HbA1c of 6.5%. His cholesterol levels are also within the normal range.

His surgical procedure is being performed to address a hernia that has been causing him discomfort and occasional pain for the past few months. He has been experiencing occasional episodes of nausea and vomiting, which are suspected to be related to the hernia. The surgical team is planning to repair the hernia using a laparoscopic procedure, which has a shorter recovery time and lower risk of complications compared to open surgery.

The patient has been instructed to discontinue his anticoagulant medication, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a week prior to the surgery. Preoperative labs, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. His cardiac workup, including an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, showed no significant abnormalities.

Due to the patient's diabetes, his blood glucose levels will be closely monitored during the perioperative period to ensure they remain within target range. He will receive intravenous fluids with glucose as needed during the surgery to maintain euglycemia. The anesthesiologist has discussed the risks and benefits of general anesthesia with the patient, and he has provided informed consent for the procedure.

The surgery was performed without any complications, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He remained stable throughout the surgery, with no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. Intraoperative antibiotics were administered as per protocol to prevent surgical site infections. The hernia was successfully repaired using the laparoscopic technique, and the surgeon reported no unexpected findings or complications.

Following the surgery, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any significant pain or discomfort. He was able to tolerate clear liquids without any issues. He was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to solid foods as tolerated.

The patient was discharged home later that day with postoperative instructions that included limiting physical activity for the first few days and avoiding heavy lifting for a few weeks to allow for optimal healing. He was prescribed acetaminophen for pain control if needed and given instructions for proper wound care. He was advised to contact his surgeon if he experienced increasing pain, redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical site.

The patient had a smooth postoperative course and did not experience any complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or bowel obstruction. He followed up with the surgeon in the outpatient clinic one week after the surgery for a wound check, which showed no signs of infection or dehiscence.

Overall, the patient's surgery and postoperative course were uneventful. His hernia was successfully repaired, and he was able to return to his usual activities after a brief recovery period. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and reported a significant improvement in his symptoms.
