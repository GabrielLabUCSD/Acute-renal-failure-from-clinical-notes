The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented to the hospital with complaints of severe knee pain. He had a history of long-standing osteoarthritis, with recurrent flare-ups. His pain worsened over the past few months, severely limiting his daily activities and quality of life. Conservative management, including physical therapy and medications, failed to provide adequate relief. After discussion with his orthopedic surgeon, the patient decided to undergo a total knee replacement surgery.

In terms of medical history, the patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension, which was well-controlled with medication. He had a history of type 2 diabetes, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications. The patient also had a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, for which he was taking a statin. He denied any history of chronic kidney disease, and his baseline renal function was within normal limits.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation to ensure his suitability for surgery. His preoperative laboratory results were unremarkable, with normal complete blood count and serum electrolytes. An ECG showed no significant abnormalities, and a chest X-ray was clear. The patient was counseled about the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for complications such as infection, blood clots, and anesthesia-related complications. He provided informed consent and was scheduled for surgery within the next month.

Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the orthopedic ward. He received appropriate perioperative prophylactic antibiotics and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Physiotherapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to assist with mobility and strengthening exercises. Pain control was achieved using a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. The patient was closely monitored for signs of infection, wound healing, and any complications related to the surgery or anesthesia.

During the postoperative period, the patient's recovery progressed well. He tolerated oral intake and was able to walk with assistance a few days after surgery. His pain gradually subsided, allowing for an increase in physical therapy exercises and ambulation. The surgical wound healed without signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and his diabetes management remained stable throughout the hospital stay. The orthopedic team was satisfied with the patient's progress, and he was discharged home after five days.

No significant postoperative complications were encountered during the patient's hospital stay. He experienced no signs of infection, thromboembolic events, or anesthesia-related complications. His surgical wound remained clean and well-approximated. The patient was given instructions for wound care, activity modification, and follow-up appointments. He was advised to continue physical therapy and maintain a healthy lifestyle to ensure optimal healing and recovery.

In summary, the patient with long-standing osteoarthritis opted for total knee replacement surgery due to severe pain and functional limitations. His medical history included well-controlled hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Preoperative evaluation revealed no contraindications for surgery. Postoperatively, the patient had a smooth recovery, progressing well with pain control, ambulation, and wound healing. No significant complications were encountered during his hospital stay. The patient was discharged home with instructions for further rehabilitation and follow-up.
