Patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. His blood pressure has been well controlled on lisinopril 10 mg daily, and his diabetes has been managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily.

He is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for a hernia repair. The patient has a history of recurrent inguinal hernias and has been experiencing increasing discomfort and pain in the groin area. His primary care physician referred him for surgical evaluation.

In his preoperative workup, he underwent routine lab tests including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, all of which were within normal limits. His chest x-ray showed no significant findings and an electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.

The patient reported having a previous hernia repair surgery ten years ago, which was successful without any complications. He denied any history of deep vein thrombosis or clotting disorders.

Regarding his surgical history, the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy five years ago for symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uneventful, and he recovered well without any postoperative complications.

During the pre-anesthetic evaluation, the anesthesiologist determined that the patient is a healthy candidate for surgery. His physical examination showed no cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological abnormalities. The patient had a body mass index of 28, within the overweight range.

In the preoperative discussion, the surgeon informed the patient of the risks and benefits associated with the hernia repair surgery. The patient was educated on the possibility of postoperative pain, bleeding, infection, and recurrence.

The patient received clear instructions for the use of prophylactic antibiotics and was advised to withhold his metformin on the day of surgery. He was informed about the fasting requirements before surgery and given detailed information about postoperative care, including pain management and wound care.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital and underwent successful inguinal hernia repair, which was performed laparoscopically. The procedure lasted approximately two hours, and the surgeon reported no complications during the operation.

The patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of postoperative complications. His vital signs remained stable, and he was given intravenous fluids for hydration.

Following surgery, the patient experienced mild to moderate pain at the incision site, which was managed with oral analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and atelectasis.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on the second postoperative day. He was instructed to continue using the prescribed pain medication as needed and to follow up with the surgeon in two weeks for a wound check.

During the follow-up visit, the surgeon noted that the patient's incision site had healed well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient reported minimal pain and had resumed his normal daily activities.

At the three-month follow-up appointment, the patient had fully recovered from the surgery, and there were no signs of recurrent hernia. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained well controlled, and he continued to take lisinopril and metformin as prescribed.

In summary, the patient presented with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, which were managed with medication. He underwent an elective hernia repair surgery without complications and had an uneventful postoperative course. The patient's incision site healed well, and pain was effectively managed. He achieved a successful recovery and did not experience any postoperative complications.
