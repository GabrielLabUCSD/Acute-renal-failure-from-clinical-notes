The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He has been on medications to control these conditions for several years. The patient is also a former smoker, having quit 10 years ago. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient had been experiencing worsening pain and limited mobility in his left knee due to severe osteoarthritis, which has been refractory to conservative management. He has previously tried physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections without significant relief. Given the impact of his knee pain on his daily activities and quality of life, it was decided that total knee replacement surgery would be the most appropriate intervention.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough medical evaluation, which included a detailed history and physical examination. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and urinalysis, were obtained. All results were within normal limits except for slightly elevated blood pressure and blood glucose levels, which were managed with adjustments in his antihypertensive and diabetic medications.

As part of the preoperative protocol, the patient received prophylactic antibiotic therapy to reduce the risk of surgical site infection. The surgery proceeded uneventfully under general anesthesia. The patient was closely monitored throughout the procedure, and all vital signs remained stable.

Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery. He was closely monitored for any signs of complications, especially postoperative bleeding, infection, or deep vein thrombosis. Appropriate prophylactic measures, including the use of compression stockings and anticoagulants, were implemented to prevent venous thromboembolism.

The patient's pain was managed with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote range of motion, mobility, and functional independence. He was encouraged to gradually bear weight on the operated knee with the aid of assistive devices.

During the postoperative course, the patient developed mild postoperative edema and bruising around the surgical site, which were expected after the procedure. However, these resolved with conservative management, including elevation, ice application, and compressive dressings. The patient reported a gradual improvement in pain and mobility with physical therapy sessions.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period, and he did not develop any signs of infection or other complications. His laboratory values, including complete blood count and renal function tests, remained within normal ranges. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels were actively managed, and the patient was closely monitored in the hospital for glycemic control.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate pain medications, written instructions for wound care, and a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine postoperative evaluation and adjustment of his antihypertensive and diabetic medications.

During the routine follow-up appointment, the patient reported a satisfactory recovery with significant reduction in knee pain and improved mobility compared to the preoperative period. The surgical wound appeared to be healing well without any signs of infection. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and his overall postoperative experience.

In conclusion, the patient underwent total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. The surgery was successful without any intraoperative complications. In the postoperative period, he had mild edema and bruising around the knee incision, which resolved with conservative management. He did not experience any major complications, such as infection or deep vein thrombosis. The patient had a smooth recovery and reported improved pain and mobility following the surgery.
