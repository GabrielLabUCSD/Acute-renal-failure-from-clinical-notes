The patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managed with medications including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. The patient had a recent diagnosis of a benign tumor in his colon and is scheduled to undergo surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient's vital signs were stable, with no significant abnormalities on physical examination. Laboratory investigations revealed well-controlled blood glucose levels with an HbA1c of 6.5%. His lipid profile showed normal levels, with total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL. Renal function tests were within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL.

The patient provided a thorough medical history, reporting no known allergies to medications or anesthesia. He denied any recent episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath, or heart palpitations. His exercise tolerance was good, being able to walk two miles without difficulty. The patient has a history of smoking but quit five years ago.

During the anesthesia evaluation, the patient was found to have a Mallampati Class II airway, indicating a favorable intubation condition. His airway examination revealed normal mouth opening and neck extension, suggesting no anticipated difficulties during intubation. His cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable, with clear lung fields and a regular heart rhythm.

With regards to past surgical history, the patient underwent cholecystectomy ten years ago due to acute cholecystitis. He tolerated the surgery well and had an uneventful recovery without any postoperative complications.

The patient was admitted to the hospital one day before the surgery for preoperative preparations. He was placed on NPO (nothing by mouth) status after midnight and received appropriate bowel preparation. In the morning of the surgery, the patient received intravenous antibiotics as a prophylaxis.

On the day of the surgery, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was taken to the operating room. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and all necessary precautions were taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis, including the use of compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices.

During the surgery, the tumor was successfully excised, and the patient's colon was resected. The procedure lasted approximately three hours, and the estimated blood loss was minimal. The patient received appropriate pain control postoperatively through a patient-controlled analgesia pump.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for close monitoring. His vital signs remained stable, and he was gradually weaned off the ventilator. He received intravenous fluids and nutrition to maintain hydration and nourishment.

Throughout the patient's hospital stay, his surgical wound was assessed regularly and showed evidence of good healing without signs of infection. The patient's pain was adequately controlled with oral analgesics, and he was encouraged to begin ambulation as soon as possible to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful, and he did not develop any major complications such as wound dehiscence, surgical site infection, or postoperative bleeding. He had regular follow-up visits with his surgical team and showed steady progress in his recovery.

The patient was discharged from the hospital five days after the surgery with instructions for wound care, pain management, and follow-up appointments. He was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and compliance with his medication regimen for his chronic conditions.

In conclusion, the patient had a successful surgery for the excision of a benign colon tumor. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any major complications. With appropriate postoperative care and close follow-up, the patient is expected to have a smooth recovery and return to his normal daily activities.
