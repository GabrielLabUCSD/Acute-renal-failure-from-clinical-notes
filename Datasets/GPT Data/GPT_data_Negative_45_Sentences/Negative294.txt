The patient, Mr. X, is a 50-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a planned surgical procedure. He has a complex medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and obesity. He has been on antihypertensive medications, including lisinopril and metoprolol, for several years.

Mr. X's diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents, including metformin and glipizide. His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels have been consistently around 7% over the past year. He has never required insulin therapy. He monitors his blood glucose levels regularly at home and adheres to a diabetic diet.

In addition to his chronic conditions, Mr. X has a history of myocardial infarction two years ago. He underwent coronary angiography, which showed significant coronary artery disease. He subsequently had a percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. He has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel since then.

Mr. X's surgical procedure is planned to address severe osteoarthritis in his left knee. He has been experiencing chronic pain and difficulty ambulating, which has significantly impacted his quality of life. Conservative management, including physical therapy and analgesics, has been unsuccessful in relieving his symptoms.

Prior to surgery, Mr. X underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation. His complete blood count and coagulation profile were within normal limits, with a hemoglobin level of 14 g/dL. His renal function, as determined by serum creatinine levels, was also within the normal range at 1.0 mg/dL. However, it is important to note that he has a history of chronic kidney disease stage 2, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 65 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

Mr. X also underwent a cardiology consultation to assess his cardiovascular fitness for surgery. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm, and echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. Stress testing was not performed due to his recent myocardial infarction and absence of symptoms suggestive of ischemia.

During the surgical procedure, Mr. X received general anesthesia and underwent a left total knee arthroplasty. The surgical team documented no intraoperative complications. The procedure lasted approximately two hours, and Mr. X tolerated it well.

In the immediate postoperative period, Mr. X was closely monitored in the recovery room. He received appropriate pain management with a combination of analgesic medications, including opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.

Mr. X's vital signs remained stable, and he was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet within a few hours after surgery. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and gradually increase his mobility with the assistance of physical therapy. A sequential compression device was applied to his lower extremities to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

Mr. X's postoperative course was uneventful, without any signs of surgical site infection. He began weight-bearing activities under the guidance of physical therapy on the second day following surgery. An epidural catheter was placed for postoperative pain control, and it was removed on the third day without complications.

He was transitioned to oral pain medications and gradually weaned off them as his pain improved. His surgical wound healed well, without any signs of dehiscence or delayed healing. He received comprehensive wound care and followed the recommended dressing changes.

Mr. X's hemoglobin levels were monitored regularly, and he did not require any blood transfusions during his hospital stay. His renal function remained stable throughout the postoperative period, with no significant changes in serum creatinine levels.

On the fifth postoperative day, Mr. X was deemed fit for discharge, with appropriate pain control and optimal mobility. He was provided with detailed instructions for wound care, signs of infection, and when to follow up with his surgeon. He was also prescribed a short course of prophylactic antibiotics to finish at home.

Although Mr. X had a successful postoperative course overall, he did experience a minor postoperative complication of a superficial wound infection, likely due to poor wound healing secondary to his chronic conditions. The infection was managed with local wound care and a seven-day course of antibiotics. The wound was closely monitored, and there were no signs of deep tissue involvement or systemic infection.

In summary, Mr. X, a 50-year-old male with a complex medical history including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and obesity, successfully underwent a left total knee arthroplasty for severe osteoarthritis. The surgery was performed without intraoperative complications, and his immediate postoperative course was uneventful. He did experience a minor wound infection, which was managed appropriately. His renal function remained stable, and he was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with appropriate instructions for continued care.
