The patient is a 56-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) two years ago and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, resulting in four coronary artery bypasses.

The patient also has a history of hyperlipidemia and is on statin therapy to manage his cholesterol levels. In addition, he has a long-standing history of smoking but recently quit two years ago. He occasionally experiences angina symptoms, which are managed with nitroglycerin as needed.

His medications include metoprolol for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, aspirin for his heart condition, and atorvastatin for cholesterol management. He is adherent to his medications and has regular follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and cardiologist.

The patient has routine check-ups with his doctors to monitor his cardiac function with echocardiograms and stress tests. His most recent echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular function with no evidence of significant structural abnormalities. His stress test was negative for any signs of myocardial ischemia.

He has undergone preoperative evaluation by the anesthesiologist and has been deemed fit for surgery. His preoperative labs including a complete blood count, renal function panel, liver function tests, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities.

In the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored in the surgical recovery unit. He received adequate pain control and was started on prophylactic antibiotics as per surgical protocol. Early mobilization was encouraged to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period. He was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues and maintained good oral intake. His incision site was assessed regularly for signs of infection or poor wound healing, but no complications were noted.

Physiotherapy was initiated to promote respiratory function and prevent postoperative pulmonary complications. The patient was compliant with the physiotherapy exercises and demonstrated satisfactory lung expansion and cough effort.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He did not experience any major complications such as wound dehiscence, surgical site infection, or cardiovascular events. His pain was adequately managed with oral analgesics and he did not require any additional interventions.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's renal function remained stable, with normal urine output and no evidence of acute kidney injury. His serum creatinine levels were consistently within the normal range.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day five with appropriate wound care instructions. He was advised to continue his regular medications and follow-up with his primary care physician and cardiologist for routine postoperative surveillance.

No complications or adverse events related to the surgery were reported during the patient's postoperative follow-up visits. His incision site healed well and there were no signs of infection or delayed wound healing. His cardiac function remained stable, without any evidence of recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.

The patient completed a course of physical therapy to regain his strength and mobility. He actively participated in his rehabilitation process and showed improvement in his exercise tolerance and overall functional status.

Follow-up imaging studies, including a repeat echocardiogram, were scheduled to assess his cardiac function and evaluate the patency of his coronary artery grafts. These tests showed no significant changes compared to the preoperative studies, indicating successful surgical outcomes.

In summary, this patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting two years ago and currently manages his health with medications. He recently quit smoking and had no acute renal failure.

His preoperative evaluation was favorable, with normal lab results and cardiac function. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful without major complications. He was discharged home after five days and had successful follow-up visits. Overall, he showed positive progress and maintained a stable health status following surgery.
