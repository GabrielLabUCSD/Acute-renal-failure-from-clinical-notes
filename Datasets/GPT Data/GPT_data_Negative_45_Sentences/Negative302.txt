The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is scheduled to undergo surgery for an elective procedure. The patient is compliant with his medications and has his blood sugar under control with oral hypoglycemic agents. His blood pressure is well managed with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. His lipid profile is within the target range with the use of a statin. The patient has had no recent exacerbations of his chronic conditions and is medically stable for the surgery.

The patient's surgical history also includes a knee arthroscopy for a meniscus tear, which was successful in reducing his knee pain and improving his range of motion. He did not experience any complications from that procedure as well.

During preoperative assessment, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his laboratory results were generally within normal limits. His renal function was also normal, with a creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min, ruling out any underlying kidney disease.
