The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has been managing his blood pressure with lisinopril 20mg daily and amlodipine 5mg daily. His diabetes is controlled with metformin 1000mg twice daily and he has a recent HbA1c of 7.2%. His cholesterol levels are managed with atorvastatin 40mg daily, resulting in LDL levels within target range. The patient has a previous surgical history of appendectomy and inguinal hernia repair.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He has a well-healed surgical scar in the right lower quadrant from his appendectomy and a small scar from his previous hernia repair. The rest of his physical examination is unremarkable, with clear breath sounds and no signs of infection or organ dysfunction.

Initial laboratory results show a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL on the day of surgery, and he is given his usual morning dose of metformin prior to surgery. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram are within normal limits.

The patient undergoes surgery without complications. Anesthesia is induced with intravenous propofol and maintained with sevoflurane. He is intubated and ventilated without difficulties. The hernia repair is completed successfully, and the patient is extubated at the end of the procedure. Intraoperative blood loss is minimal, and the patient's vital signs remain stable throughout the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient is transferred to the recovery room and monitored closely. He is initially on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula but is weaned off within a few hours as his oxygen saturation remains above 95%. The patient's pain is managed with intravenous morphine, which provides adequate relief. He is encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with no signs of infection or wound complications. He is transitioned to oral pain medications and is able to tolerate a regular diet. The patient's blood pressure remains stable, and his medications are resumed on the first postoperative day. His diabetes is managed with the addition of a short-acting insulin regimen to ensure glycemic control during the postoperative period.

The patient is discharged home on the second postoperative day with oral pain medications and a scheduled follow-up appointment in two weeks. He is instructed to monitor his blood pressure and blood glucose levels regularly and to gradually increase his activity level. The patient is advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for the next four to six weeks to allow for proper healing.

In summary, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia who underwent an uneventful surgery for hernia repair. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he did not experience any significant complications. The patient was discharged home with appropriate pain management and instructions for postoperative care. His long-term management of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia remains unchanged.
