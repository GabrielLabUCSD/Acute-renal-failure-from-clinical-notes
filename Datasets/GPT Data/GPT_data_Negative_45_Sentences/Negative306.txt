He presents to the hospital planning to have surgery for a symptomatic inguinal hernia. The patient reports intermittent groin pain and discomfort, which has progressively worsened over the past few months.

In terms of his surgical history, Patient A had previous cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones about five years ago, which was uncomplicated. He also had a colonoscopy two years ago that showed no abnormalities. He has no known drug allergies. 

During the preoperative evaluation, his vital signs were within normal limits and he had no significant physical examination findings. Laboratory investigations revealed a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, total cholesterol level of 185 mg/dL, and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. His renal function is within normal limits with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient was deemed fit for surgery and provided with appropriate preoperative instructions. He was advised to discontinue metformin for 24 hours prior to surgery and to report any signs of infection or fever before the surgery. Patient A understands the instructions and agrees to comply.

On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The surgical team carried out an open inguinal hernia repair using mesh. The procedure lasted approximately one hour, and the patient tolerated the surgery well.

Postoperatively, the patient woke up in the recovery room without any complications. He was monitored closely for any signs of infection, bleeding, or other postoperative complications. His vital signs remained stable.

Pain management after surgery was achieved with a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patient A reported pain levels ranging from 3 to 5 out of 10 on a pain scale for the first 48 hours postoperatively. He received regular wound care and was assisted with early mobilization to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Patient A's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any significant complications during his hospital stay. Physical examination of the surgical site revealed no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. Additionally, the patient's urine output remained within normal limits, and he did not develop acute renal failure.

Prior to discharge, the patient was educated on managing postoperative pain, wound care, and signs and symptoms of infection. He was prescribed oral analgesics for pain management and advised to follow up with his surgeon in two weeks.

Patient A was discharged home in stable condition, with appropriate wound healing, and without any complications of surgery. He was advised to gradually resume his daily activities while avoiding heavy lifting for at least six weeks.

In summary, Patient A underwent an uncomplicated inguinal hernia repair surgery using mesh. His postoperative course was smooth, and he did not develop any significant complications. The patient was discharged home in stable condition and was provided with appropriate instructions for follow-up care.
