The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 4. He has been on metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and darbepoetin alfa for the past year. The patient presents with worsening osteoarthritis of the right knee and is scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

His diabetes has been relatively well-controlled with an HbA1c of 7.0%. His blood pressure has been stable with lisinopril, maintaining it around 130/80 mmHg. Lipid levels have slightly improved with atorvastatin, with total cholesterol of 190 mg/dL and LDL of 110 mg/dL. He has been experiencing frequent episodes of chronic knee pain and decreased mobility, significantly impacting his quality of life.

The patient had a preoperative consultation with an orthopedic surgeon who deemed him to be an appropriate candidate for total knee replacement. His preoperative evaluation shows a baseline serum creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, consistent with his chronic kidney disease. However, his kidney function has been stable over the past few months.

In terms of the patient's surgical risks, he is at an increased risk for surgical complications due to his comorbidities, especially his history of chronic kidney disease. However, with appropriate preoperative evaluation and management, the benefits of the surgery outweigh the risks.

The patient is scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. He is informed about the potential complications such as infection, blood clots, and adverse anesthesia reactions. The patient is also instructed to discontinue his metformin on the day of surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to experience pain and swelling in the operated knee. He will be started on intravenous antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. Thromboembolic prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin will also be initiated to minimize the risk of blood clots.

The patient will be closely monitored for acute kidney injury, as he is at an increased risk due to the surgery and anesthesia. Measures will be taken to maintain adequate hydration and avoid nephrotoxic medications during the perioperative period. The patient's renal function will be monitored with regular serum creatinine measurements.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient will participate in physical therapy to promote early mobilization and regain strength in the knee joint. Pain management will be optimized with a multimodal approach, including oral analgesics and local anesthetic infiltration.

The patient's postoperative course is generally uneventful. He reports satisfactory pain control with oral pain medications and the swelling in his knee gradually subsides. Markers of infection remain within normal limits, and there are no signs of wound complications.

The patient's kidney function is carefully monitored postoperatively, with regular serum creatinine measurements. He shows stable renal function with only a minimal increase in serum creatinine, expected with a surgical insult.

On day 4 postoperatively, the patient develops a low-grade fever with mild leukocytosis. His wound shows signs of erythema, warmth, and tenderness, raising concern for a surgical site infection. A wound culture is obtained, and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated pending culture results.

The wound culture grows methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), confirming the diagnosis of a surgical site infection. The patient is switched to intravenous vancomycin based on sensitivity results, and a course of antibiotics is completed.

Despite the infection, the patient's renal function remains stable, excluding acute kidney injury as a complication. The patient's knee range of motion gradually improves, enabling him to participate more actively in physical therapy sessions.

The patient is eventually discharged from the hospital with oral antibiotics to complete the treatment for the surgical site infection. Close outpatient follow-up is arranged to monitor his renal function, manage his chronic kidney disease, and continue physical therapy.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course presents a minor complication in the form of a surgical site infection caused by MRSA. However, diligent treatment and close monitoring prevent any adverse effects on his renal function. The patient remains motivated towards his recovery and rehabilitation after knee replacement surgery.
