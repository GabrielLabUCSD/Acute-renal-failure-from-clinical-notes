Patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a history of chronic kidney disease and is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and diuretics to manage his blood pressure.

He was diagnosed with stage 3 chronic kidney disease two years ago and has been under the care of a nephrologist since then. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has remained stable around 45 ml/min/1.73m2. He has been following a low-protein diet and taking phosphate binders to manage his renal condition.

The patient's diabetes has been well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, and he closely monitors his blood glucose levels. He has a history of stable angina due to his coronary artery disease and takes antiplatelet therapy with aspirin to reduce his risk of cardiovascular events.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an elective cholecystectomy five years ago for symptomatic gallstones, which was uneventful. He is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use.

Current preoperative investigations show stable kidney function, with serum creatinine at 1.4 mg/dL and potassium at 4.5 mmol/L. His electrocardiogram shows no acute ischemic changes, and echocardiography reveals preserved left ventricular systolic function. Chest X-ray is unremarkable.

The patient's surgery is planned for next week, and the surgical team has been informed about his chronic kidney disease and the need for careful perioperative monitoring. They have prescribed appropriate perioperative antibiotics and pain management.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery unit for any signs of acute kidney injury. His vital signs remained stable, and urine output was adequate. He received intravenous fluids cautiously to maintain adequate hydration and preserve renal function.

The patient's recovery was generally uneventful, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet within a day post-surgery. His pain was managed with oral analgesics, and he did not require any opioid medications. He was mobilized early and encouraged to ambulate to prevent complications, such as deep vein thrombosis.

During his hospital stay, no signs of infection or wound complications were noted. His renal function remained stable, with serum creatinine consistently around 1.4 mg/dL. Electrolyte levels were within normal limits, including potassium.

The patient's blood glucose levels were well-controlled throughout his hospitalization, and no episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia were documented.

Physical therapy provided education on postoperative exercises and precautions to promote a speedy recovery. The patient was discharged home five days after surgery with appropriate instructions for wound care and medication management.

Upon follow-up two weeks later, the patient reported feeling generally well. He had no signs of surgical site infection and experienced only mild incisional pain, which was managed with over-the-counter analgesics. He continued to monitor his blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and took his prescribed medications regularly.

The patient's primary care physician informed him about the importance of continued follow-up visits to monitor his renal function and manage his chronic diseases. The nephrologist recommended routine renal function tests every three months, along with dietary modifications and strict adherence to prescribed medications.

In summary, the patient had a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease, but was stable preoperatively. He underwent surgery, which was uneventful, with no postoperative complications or acute renal failure. The patient's renal function remained stable, and he was discharged home in good condition. He will require long-term management of his chronic conditions with close monitoring and follow-up appointments to optimize his overall health.
