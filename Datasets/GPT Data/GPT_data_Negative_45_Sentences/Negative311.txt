The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managed with medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for his hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and a statin for hyperlipidemia. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels have been relatively well controlled.

The patient recently underwent a preoperative evaluation for a planned surgery. His primary care physician recommended the surgery due to a chronic knee injury that has been causing significant pain and functional limitation. The patient has attempted conservative measures, including physical therapy and analgesics, without significant improvement.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient had a cholecystectomy approximately ten years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. He recovered uneventfully from that procedure and had no postoperative complications or further issues with his gallbladder.

Regarding his cardiovascular history, the patient had a myocardial infarction three years ago. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed a significant stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Ultimately, he received a drug-eluting stent to alleviate the stenosis. Since then, he has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor.

The patient also had a colonoscopy four years ago, which was unremarkable, with no evidence of polyps or malignancy. He has not had any gastrointestinal symptoms since then.

Furthermore, the patient does not have a history of respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. He is a non-smoker and denies any respiratory symptoms, such as cough or dyspnea.

In terms of his renal history, the patient has had no documented chronic kidney disease and no history of acute renal failure. His most recent basic metabolic panel showed normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient was assessed for any contraindications to surgery. He underwent a comprehensive physical examination, which was unremarkable. His vital signs were stable, and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.

Laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST segment changes or arrhythmias.

In addition to the preoperative evaluations, the patient was seen by an anesthesiologist to assess his fitness for anesthesia. He was noted to have a Mallampati score of II. His airway appeared normal without any anatomical abnormalities or predicted difficulties in endotracheal intubation.

The patient's surgical plan includes a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain. The procedure aims to improve the patient's quality of life and restore his functional mobility.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to undergo close monitoring to manage pain, prevent postoperative complications, and facilitate early mobilization. He will be started on prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, including low molecular weight heparin or a direct oral anticoagulant.

In terms of pain management, a multimodal approach will be employed, including the use of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and adjunctive therapies such as physical therapy and local anesthetic techniques.

The patient will be closely monitored for signs of infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE), with appropriate prophylaxis measures implemented. He will receive sequential compression devices (SCDs) and early ambulation to prevent venous stasis.

Additionally, the patient will be monitored for any cardiac complications, given his history of myocardial infarction and drug-eluting stent placement. Adequate pain control and proper fluid management will be crucial to optimize his cardiac function during the postoperative period.

Immediate mobilization and physical therapy will be initiated to promote joint range of motion and prevent complications such as stiffness and contractures. Continuous passive motion (CPM) will likely be utilized to facilitate early rehabilitation.

The patient's wound will be assessed regularly for signs of infection, such as erythema, swelling, warmth, and purulent discharge. Prophylactic antibiotics may be administered perioperatively, depending on the surgeon's preferences.

As for gastrointestinal management, the patient will initially be kept on a clear liquid diet and subsequently advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. Stool softeners or laxatives may be prescribed to prevent constipation, which is commonly associated with postoperative pain medications.

A urinary catheter may be inserted intraoperatively to monitor urine output and facilitate patient care. It will be removed once the patient is ambulating and able to void spontaneously.

A follow-up appointment will be scheduled for the patient after discharge to monitor his wound healing, pain management, and overall recovery. Physical therapy sessions will also be planned to ensure appropriate rehabilitation.

In terms of complications, it is important to note that acute renal failure is not expected in this patient given his preoperative normal renal function and absence of renal disease. However, potential complications may include infection, wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, anesthesia-related complications, postoperative bleeding, and delayed wound healing.

In conclusion, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, who is planning to undergo total knee replacement surgery. His postoperative course will involve pain management, close monitoring for complications, early mobilization, and physical therapy. It is crucial to provide appropriate care to prevent potential complications and ensure a successful recovery.
