The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who is planning to undergo surgery. He has been on antihypertensive medication for the past five years and has his blood pressure well controlled. Additionally, he has been managing his diabetes with oral antidiabetic drugs.

The patient had a routine preoperative assessment, including blood work, ECG, and chest X-ray. His laboratory results showed a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests. However, his fasting blood glucose levels were slightly elevated, and his HbA1c indicated suboptimal control of diabetes.

He does not have any known allergies to medications. During the preoperative discussion, it was noted that the patient occasionally smokes about half a pack of cigarettes per day but has been trying to quit.

The patient's surgical history is notable for an appendectomy performed 15 years ago. There were no complications during that surgery, and the patient had an uneventful recovery with no subsequent issues.

Upon physical examination, the patient was in overall good health. He had a body mass index of 28, indicating mild obesity, and he appeared well-nourished. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 beats per minute. Lung auscultation revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally, and his abdomen was soft and non-tender.

The patient was scheduled for a cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. Preoperative counseling was provided regarding expected postoperative pain, wound care, and incisional hygiene. The patient was advised to comply with fasting guidelines and to withhold antidiabetic medications on the day of surgery.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia without any complications. The cholecystectomy was performed laparoscopically, and there were no intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery area. He received pain management with intravenous analgesics and was kept nil per oral until bowel sounds returned. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and practice deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as atelectasis and thromboembolism.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he had minimal pain. He was started on a clear liquid diet, which he tolerated without any issues. The surgical wound was clean, dry, and intact. He was also provided with appropriate wound care instructions for home.

The patient's glucose levels were monitored closely, and sliding scale insulin was initiated to maintain blood sugar within the target range. His glucose levels gradually improved, and he was transitioned back to his regular antidiabetic medications within three days.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and he did not experience any significant complications. He was discharged home on the fourth postoperative day with instructions for wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and surgeon for further evaluation.

During the follow-up visits, the patient reported minimal pain and improvement in surgical wound healing. He was gradually weaned off pain medications and encouraged to increase physical activity. The patient's blood pressure remained under control with no adjustments in antihypertensive medications.

In terms of complications, the patient did not develop any surgical site infections, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He did not experience any respiratory issues such as atelectasis or pneumonia. There were no signs of wound dehiscence or delayed wound healing.

The patient adhered to his postoperative care plan and showed significant improvement in his overall health status. He continues to monitor his blood pressure and blood glucose levels at home, striving to maintain within target ranges. The surgical intervention significantly relieved his gallstone-related symptoms, and he reported improved quality of life.

In summary, the patient, a middle-aged male with hypertension and diabetes, underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home after an appropriate recovery period. He continues to follow up with healthcare providers and remains committed to managing his chronic conditions.
