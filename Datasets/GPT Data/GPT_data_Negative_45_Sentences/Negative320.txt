He also has a history of dyslipidemia for which he takes simvastatin 20 mg daily. He has a long history of smoking, having smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for 40 years, but he quit 10 years ago. He has had no previous surgeries. Preoperative labs showed a hemoglobin of 12 g/dL, hematocrit of 36%, and a platelet count of 220,000/mm3.

The patient is scheduled to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has been experiencing discomfort and pain for the last few months, and conservative management did not improve his symptoms. The surgeon has determined that surgical intervention is necessary. The patient is concerned about the procedure but understands the need for it.

In the preoperative period, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation by the anesthesiology team. He completed all the necessary preoperative labs and tests. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities.

The patient was counseled about the surgical procedure and the potential risks and benefits. He was informed about the possibility of complications such as infection, bleeding, and hernia recurrence. The surgeon also discussed the need for postoperative pain control and potential restrictions during the recovery period.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital and was properly prepared for the procedure. He was given intravenous fluids and prophylactic antibiotics. General anesthesia was induced, and the patient was intubated. The surgery was uneventful and lasted approximately 2 hours. The incision was closed with sutures.

Following the procedure, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room. His vital signs remained stable, and he woke up from anesthesia without any complications. He was given pain medication as needed and closely observed for any signs of postoperative pain or discomfort.

The patient was transferred to the surgical ward a few hours later. He was able to tolerate clear liquids without any issues. The surgical incision was assessed and showed no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. Pain control was managed with a combination of oral analgesics and nonpharmacologic measures such as ice packs and positioning.

During his stay in the hospital, the patient was encouraged to ambulate and engage in deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis. He had no difficulty with mobilization and reported feeling less discomfort with each passing day.

On postoperative day 2, the patient's diet was advanced to a regular oral diet, and he tolerated it well. His bowel movements resumed, and there were no signs of any gastrointestinal complications. The surgical team continued to monitor the surgical site and administered antibiotics as per protocol.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with appropriate discharge instructions. He was instructed to continue taking his usual medications and to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks. He was also advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for the next 6 weeks to allow for proper healing of the surgical site.

Throughout the postoperative course, the patient did not experience any complications related to the surgery. His pain was well-controlled, and he reported feeling significantly better compared to before the surgery. He did not develop any signs of infection, bleeding, or hernia recurrence.

The patient was compliant with his postoperative care instructions and attended all follow-up appointments. At the two-week follow-up, his surgical wound had completely healed, and he had no complaints. His incision was well-approximated with no signs of infection or dehiscence.

In summary, the patient underwent a successful hernia repair surgery without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he made a good recovery. The surgical site healed well, and he did not experience any postoperative pain or discomfort. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and expressed his gratitude towards the surgical team for their excellent care.
