The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2.
Both conditions have been well-controlled with medications.
He has no known drug allergies and is a non-smoker.
The patient presented with complaints of severe knee pain and limited mobility.
Physical examination revealed signs of osteoarthritis in both knees.
X-rays confirmed the diagnosis and showed significant joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation.
Conservative management including physical therapy, analgesics, and intra-articular injections failed to alleviate the patient's symptoms.
As a result, he opted for surgical intervention and scheduled for total knee replacement surgery.
Preoperative laboratory investigations were within normal limits, including a normal renal function panel.
The patient received preoperative education about the procedure, including risks and benefits, and provided informed consent.
He was placed on a regular diet and instructed to adhere to NPO guidelines after midnight on the day of surgery.
Anesthesia consult was obtained, and the patient was deemed fit for surgery.
The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any complications.
The total knee replacement surgery involved replacing the damaged joint surfaces with prosthetic implants.
Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for vital signs, pain levels, and wound healing.
He received intravenous fluids and pain medications as per the postoperative pain management protocol.
The patient was ambulated on the first postoperative day with the help of a physical therapist.
He was gradually transitioned to oral pain medication and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any signs of nausea or vomiting.
Wound care was provided, and the incision site remained clean and well-approximated without any signs of infection.
The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day with instructions to continue with physical therapy and prescribed pain medications.
He was advised to follow up in the outpatient clinic in two weeks for a wound check and suture removal.
During the first follow-up visit, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and mobility.
The wound was healing well, and sutures were removed without any issues.
The patient was advised to continue with physical therapy and gradually increase weight-bearing activities as tolerated.
Regular follow-up visits were scheduled at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months to monitor the patient's progress and evaluate the functionality of the prosthetic joint.
At the six-week follow-up visit, the patient continued to show satisfactory progress and achieved a good range of motion in the replaced knee.
No signs of infection or complications were noted during subsequent visits.
The patient adhered to the prescribed medication regimen and adopted a healthy lifestyle to manage his underlying medical conditions.
He reported no episodes of hypoglycemia or hypertension exacerbation during the postoperative period.
Physical therapy sessions were continued for three months, focusing on strengthening the surrounding muscles and improving joint stability.
By the end of the six-month follow-up, the patient had returned to his preoperative level of function with minimal pain and improved mobility.
No complications such as wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or prosthetic joint infection were encountered in this case.
The patient expressed his satisfaction with the surgical outcome and his improved quality of life.
He was advised to schedule annual follow-up visits to monitor the longevity of the prosthetic joint and address any potential concerns in the future.
Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he successfully recovered from the total knee replacement surgery without any complications.
