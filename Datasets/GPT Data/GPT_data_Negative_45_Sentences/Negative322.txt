This is the medical history of a patient who is planning to have surgery. The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has had a long-standing history of uncontrolled blood pressure, with multiple ER visits for hypertensive crises in the past. His hypertension is currently managed with a combination of three antihypertensive medications: lisinopril, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide.

He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ten years ago and has been on a stable regimen of metformin and glipizide. His diabetes has been fairly well controlled with an HbA1c consistently ranging between 7-8%. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and has been on atorvastatin for the past five years. His lipid profile has shown significant improvement on this medication.

The patient has a history of smoking, approximately half a pack per day for the past 30 years. He is willing to quit but has been unsuccessful in previous attempts. He consumes alcohol occasionally, with only social drinking.

The patient has no known drug allergies or adverse reactions to medications. He denies any family history of cardiac diseases or malignancies. He has not undergone any surgeries in the past.

In terms of his current surgical indication, the patient is scheduled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, especially after fatty meals, for the past six months. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of gallstones.

Preoperatively, the patient was evaluated by the anesthesiology team and deemed fit for surgery. His cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable, with clear lung fields and no evidence of peripheral edema. An EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes. Basic laboratory tests, including complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, were within normal limits.

The patient was given preoperative instructions about fasting prior to the day of surgery and advised to avoid any blood-thinning medications. He was advised to continue taking his regular antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the morning of surgery with a sip of water.

The surgery proceeded smoothly, and no intraoperative complications were encountered. The patient tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia, and postoperatively, he was taken to the recovery room for observation.

During the postoperative course, the patient's vital signs remained stable. He had adequate pain control with opioid analgesia and was able to ambulate within a few hours of surgery. His diet was gradually advanced from clear liquids to a regular diet as tolerated.

He remained in the hospital for two days and was discharged with instructions for wound care and pain management. He was also advised to follow a low-fat diet to prevent recurrent gallstone formation. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up clinic visit in two weeks to review his surgical wound and assess for any potential complications.

His postoperative course was uneventful, without any signs of infection or wound dehiscence. He did not experience any major complications related to the surgical procedure. The patient was compliant with his medications and lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation counseling. He was referred to his primary care physician for continued management of his chronic medical conditions.
