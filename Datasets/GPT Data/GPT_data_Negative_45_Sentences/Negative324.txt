The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. He has a history of myocardial infarction three years ago for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history.

His current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and aspirin. He reports good compliance with his medications and regular follow-up with his primary care physician.

The patient is scheduled to undergo surgery for a right total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. He has had chronic knee pain for the past five years, which has significantly impacted his daily activities and quality of life. Non-surgical interventions, including physical therapy and analgesics, have provided minimal relief.

Preoperative evaluation revealed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. His electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits, including complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and liver function tests.

During the procedure, the patient received general anesthesia without any complications. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient tolerated it well. He was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit where he recovered without any issues.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was started on a multimodal pain management regimen, including opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. He was encouraged to perform active range of motion exercises to minimize postoperative stiffness and enhance rehabilitation.

The patient's vital signs remained stable during the postoperative course. Blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and adjustments were made to his antidiabetic medications to maintain optimal glycemic control.

On the first postoperative day, the patient was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist. He reported pain at a tolerable level and was able to tolerate a regular diet. Wound inspection revealed no signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient continued to make progress in his mobility and pain control during his hospital stay. He participated in daily physical therapy sessions and demonstrated improvement in his range of motion and strength.

On the third postoperative day, the patient was discharged home with a prescription for pain medications and instructions for continued physical therapy as an outpatient. He was advised to monitor his blood glucose levels closely and make appropriate adjustments to his antidiabetic medications as needed.

Throughout his recovery at home, the patient adhered to the prescribed pain management regimen and attended scheduled physical therapy sessions. He reported gradual improvement in his knee pain and functional mobility.

During his follow-up appointment six weeks after surgery, the patient showed significant improvement in his range of motion and was able to perform weight-bearing activities without significant pain. His surgical wound had healed well without any signs of infection or complications.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no major complications identified. He achieved satisfactory pain control and showed satisfactory progress in his functional recovery. He was advised to continue regular follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon for long-term monitoring and management of his knee replacement.
