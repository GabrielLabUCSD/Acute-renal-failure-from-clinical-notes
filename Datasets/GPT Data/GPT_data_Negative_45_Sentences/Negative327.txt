The patient has been educated on the risks and benefits of the surgery, as well as the postoperative course. She understands the need for adequate pain control, early ambulation, and deep breathing exercises to reduce the risk of postoperative complications.

The patient has been instructed to continue taking her preoperative medications, including metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin, on the day of surgery with sips of water.

She has also been advised to adhere to a clear liquid diet and to stop eating and drinking after midnight on the day of surgery.

The patient has undergone a thorough evaluation by the anesthesia team, with no significant findings or contraindications identified. The anesthesiologist will optimize her blood pressure control perioperatively to reduce the risk of perioperative cardiovascular events.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to have a routine recovery. She will be closely monitored for any signs of infection, bleeding, or other complications.

Pain management will be optimized to ensure her comfort and promote early mobilization. The patient will be encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to prevent postoperative atelectasis.

In terms of fluid management, the patient will receive intravenous fluids as needed to maintain adequate hydration and hemodynamic stability.

The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored closely, and sliding scale insulin may be initiated if necessary to maintain glycemic control in the perioperative period.
