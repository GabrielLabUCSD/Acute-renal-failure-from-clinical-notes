Patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis of the knees. She is scheduled to undergo elective surgery for total knee replacement due to severe pain and functional limitation. The patient reports worsening knee pain over the past two years, which has significantly impaired her ability to perform activities of daily living.

Her hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient's blood pressure readings have consistently been within target range with no recent complaints of dizziness, syncope, or symptoms of end-organ damage.

Hyperlipidemia is managed with atorvastatin, and the patient's lipid profile has improved with the latest LDL cholesterol measurement of 78 mg/dL. She follows a low-fat diet and exercises regularly to maintain cardiovascular health.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is controlled with metformin, with her most recent hemoglobin A1c level at 6.5%. The patient reports no symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, and her routine blood glucose monitoring has been within target range.

The patient's osteoarthritis has been managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and regular joint injections with corticosteroids. She has not experienced adverse effects from these treatments. Rheumatology consultations have suggested that total knee replacement would be the most appropriate intervention.

The patient's preoperative laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and urinalysis, were unremarkable. Her renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

Anesthesiology evaluation confirmed her suitability for surgery, with no concerns regarding anesthesia administration or potential contraindications. The patient provided informed consent after discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, wound healing, and mobility. She was started on a multimodal analgesic regimen, including opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's recovery was uneventful, with gradual improvement in pain, range of motion, and functional capacity. She was able to achieve weight-bearing status on her affected leg with the assistance of a walker within the first week post-surgery. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled with orthopedics and physical therapy to monitor her progress.

No immediate or delayed complications were observed. She did not develop any surgical site infections, wound dehiscence, or leakage of joint fluid. The patient did not experience any postoperative acute renal failure or other renal complications.

On follow-up visits, the patient reported gradual improvement in mobility and a reduction in pain levels. She reached full weight-bearing status within six weeks and continued her physical therapy to strengthen the muscles surrounding her knee joint. By three months post-surgery, the patient reported near-complete resolution of pain and a significant improvement in her quality of life.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience for total knee replacement was successful, with an uneventful recovery and no complications observed, including acute renal failure. She is now able to perform daily activities with minimal discomfort and plans to resume regular exercise to maintain the functionality of her new joint.
