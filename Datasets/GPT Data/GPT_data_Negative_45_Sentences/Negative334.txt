On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. His body mass index (BMI) is 28 kg/mÂ², indicating overweight. There are no obvious abnormalities noted upon inspection, and his abdomen is soft and nontender.

Preoperatively, the patient was optimized by his primary care physician and had routine blood tests performed. His complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control.

The patient was seen by the anesthesiologist to evaluate his fitness for surgery. The anesthesiologist determined that he would be a suitable candidate for general anesthesia based on his overall health and absence of contraindications.

The patient was instructed to fast for 8 hours prior to surgery and to take his regular medications with a sip of water as directed. He was educated about deep breathing exercises and postoperative pain management options, including the use of non-opioid analgesics.

The surgery was performed uneventfully, and the patient was closely monitored during the procedure. He received prophylactic antibiotics as per the surgical team's protocol. The procedure duration was approximately 2 hours, and the estimated blood loss was minimal. There were no intraoperative complications.

In the postoperative period, the patient was initially monitored closely in the recovery room. He was assessed for pain, wound healing, and any signs of infection. His vital signs remained stable, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to minimize the risk of complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient received appropriate postoperative analgesia, including non-opioid medications and opioids as needed. The surgical team discontinued the prophylactic antibiotics according to their protocol. His incision site was clean, dry, and intact, without any signs of infection or wound dehiscence.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and had no evidence of surgical site infection or postoperative bleeding. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not develop any major complications.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with proper wound care instructions and a prescription for analgesics. He was advised to continue his regular medications and to monitor his blood glucose levels closely in the following weeks. He was scheduled for a follow-up visit with his primary care physician in two weeks to monitor his recovery and discuss any concerns.

Upon follow-up, the patient reported feeling well and exhibited signs of healing with a well-approximated surgical incision. His vital signs remained stable, and he reported minimal pain that was effectively managed with non-opioid analgesics. He was referred to physical therapy for a gradual return to his baseline activity level.

In conclusion, the patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, underwent surgery without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 3. The patient's overall recovery was favorable, and he did not experience complications such as acute renal failure or surgical site infections. He was advised to continue his regular medications, monitor his blood glucose levels, and gradually increase his physical activity.
