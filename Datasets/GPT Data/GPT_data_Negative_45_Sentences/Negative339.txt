The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital for surgery after being diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in his left hip. He has a significant medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His vital signs were stable upon admission, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. The patient reported occasional angina but denied any recent cardiac events.

His past surgical history includes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago for symptomatic gallstones. He has no known drug allergies and takes regular medications including metoprolol for his hypertension, atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia, and metformin for his diabetes. His glycemic control is fair, with a most recent HbA1c level of 7.2%.

Upon physical examination, the patient had tenderness and limited range of motion in his left hip. X-rays revealed advanced degeneration of the left hip joint. After discussing the risks and benefits, the patient agreed to undergo total hip replacement surgery. Preoperative labs were within normal limits, including a hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL and a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient was scheduled for surgery and received appropriate preoperative counseling. He was instructed to fast for eight hours before the surgery and was started on prophylactic antibiotics one hour prior to the procedure. Anesthesia consult was obtained, and the patient was determined to be an appropriate candidate for the surgery under general anesthesia. He was informed about the potential risks of surgery, including bleeding, infection, and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient underwent an uneventful total hip replacement surgery. The surgery lasted approximately two hours, and there were no intraoperative complications reported. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. He was instructed on deep breathing exercises, early ambulation, and pain management. He was placed on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and compression stockings.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild pain at the surgical site which was managed with analgesics. His vital signs remained stable, and he maintained good urine output. The wound was assessed daily and showed no signs of infection. Physical therapy was initiated on postoperative day one, focusing on range of motion exercises and gait training. The patient was able to bear weight on the operated leg without significant pain.

Throughout the hospital stay, glycemic control was maintained with sliding scale insulin. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medications as tolerated and was able to eat a regular diet without any difficulties. On postoperative day two, the patient's hemoglobin level dropped to 10 g/dL, but this was attributed to postoperative blood loss and he did not require a blood transfusion.

The patient's recovery continued to progress well, and he was discharged home on postoperative day four with appropriate discharge instructions. He was prescribed physical therapy and instructed on wound care. He was advised to continue his regular medications and to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks. He was also educated on signs and symptoms of potential complications such as wound infection and deep vein thrombosis.

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reported significant improvement in his pain and mobility. His wound had healed well without any signs of infection. He had regained full range of motion in his hip joint and was able to bear weight on the operated leg without any limitations. His glycemic control remained stable, and no further adjustments to his antidiabetic medication were required.

Overall, the patient had a successful total hip replacement surgery with no significant complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he achieved the desired outcome of improved pain and function. The patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and was able to return to his regular activities without any issues.
