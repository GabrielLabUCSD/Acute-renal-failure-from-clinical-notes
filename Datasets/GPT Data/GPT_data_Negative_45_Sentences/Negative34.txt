Patient XYZ is a 55-year-old male who presents with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He has previously undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery four years ago. XYZ is currently asymptomatic and has been managed conservatively with medications. The patient has been experiencing progressive angina symptoms lately, necessitating the need for further surgical intervention.

Further evaluation revealed severe triple vessel coronary artery disease, prompting the decision to schedule XYZ for an elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Pre-operative assessments were performed, including a complete blood count, cardiac enzymes, coagulation profile, and an echocardiogram. The echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%. Additional cardiac catheterization was performed to confirm the extent of coronary artery disease and to guide surgical planning.

The patient was thoroughly educated about the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives. XYZ acknowledged and understood the information provided, giving informed consent for the surgery. He was advised to discontinue antiplatelet medications and anticoagulants prior to the surgery to minimize bleeding risk during the operation.

On the day of the surgery, XYZ was taken to the operating room, and general anesthesia was administered. The procedure involved harvesting the left internal mammary artery for grafting and anastomosing it to the left anterior descending artery. Saphenous vein grafts were also utilized to bypass the other occluded coronary arteries. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for monitoring.

During the initial postoperative course, XYZ's vital signs remained stable, and he was weaned off mechanical ventilation successfully. Continuous cardiac monitoring showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant arrhythmias. Fluid and electrolyte balance was closely monitored, and intravenous medications were administered as needed. Pharmacological therapy included antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statin therapy.

Meticulous wound care was maintained to prevent infection, and prophylactic antibiotics were administered. XYZ was mobilized early with the assistance of physical therapy to prevent complications like deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. Pulmonary hygiene techniques, such as incentive spirometry and deep breathing exercises, were encouraged.

Routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood count and metabolic panel, were performed to monitor the patient's recovery. Serial cardiac enzyme measurements were also obtained to check for any myocardial injury. The patient was kept on a cardiac monitoring device to promptly detect any cardiac rhythm abnormalities.

XYZ's postoperative recovery was uneventful, with no significant complications encountered. He did not develop acute renal failure during the entire perioperative period. The patient's incision site healed well without signs of infection. There were no postoperative cardiac arrhythmias, and his vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery phase. He was gradually weaned off intravenous medications and transitioned to oral formulations.

Physical rehabilitation was initiated to restore the patient's functional abilities and improve his overall strength. A structured program focusing on cardiovascular exercises, as well as flexibility and strength training, was designed by the physiotherapy team.

During follow-up visits, XYZ reported an overall improvement in symptoms, with a reduction in anginal episodes. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels were properly managed with medications. Additionally, lipid levels were optimized, and the patient was advised to adhere to a heart-healthy diet and lifestyle modifications.

In summary, patient XYZ underwent an elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery for severe triple vessel coronary artery disease. The surgery was successful, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. No complications, including acute renal failure, occurred during the perioperative period. XYZ demonstrated favorable recovery, resulting in improved symptoms and overall cardiovascular health.
