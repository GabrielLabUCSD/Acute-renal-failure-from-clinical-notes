The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. The patient has a history of smoking for the past 30 years but quit six months ago. He has been on antihypertensive medication for the past five years and is currently well controlled. His diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents, and his last HbA1c level was 6.8%.

In terms of cardiovascular history, the patient had a myocardial infarction five years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. He has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then and has shown no signs of angina or other cardiovascular symptoms. His last stress test six months ago was negative for ischemia.

The patient has a body mass index of 30, indicating obesity. He has a sedentary lifestyle and does not engage in regular physical exercise. He does, however, mention that he walks around 30 minutes daily.

The patient reports a previous history of two hernia repairs, one in the inguinal region and another umbilical hernia repair. Both surgeries were successful with no postoperative complications.

Laboratory investigations reveal a normal complete blood count and liver function tests. His renal function tests are within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 80 mL/min/1.73m2. There are no significant abnormalities in his electrocardiogram or chest X-ray. His current medications include metoprolol, aspirin, atorvastatin, metformin, and glipizide.

The patient has been thoroughly counseled about the risks and benefits of the proposed surgery. He understands that there may be potential complications such as wound infection, bleeding, organ damage, or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient is scheduled for surgery in two weeks and has been advised to stop taking aspirin one week prior to the procedure. He has also been instructed to hold his oral antidiabetes medications on the day of surgery. He will be started on intravenous antibiotics in the operating room and will receive general anesthesia.

Following surgery, the patient will be monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit for a few hours before being transferred to the surgical ward. He will be encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. His pain will be managed with a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics.

In terms of complications, the patient has a higher risk for poor wound healing due to his diabetes and obesity. However, given his previous surgeries with no complications, the risk is not significantly higher. He will be closely monitored for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical site.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to be uneventful. He will continue his regular medications, including antihypertensive and hypoglycemic agents, once he is tolerating oral intake. The surgical team will follow up with him in the clinic in two weeks to assess his wound healing progress and ensure there are no signs of infection.

Overall, the patient's surgical plan takes into account his medical history and risk factors. The informed consent process has been completed, and the patient is well-prepared for surgery. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the surgical team anticipates a successful procedure and a smooth recovery for the patient.
