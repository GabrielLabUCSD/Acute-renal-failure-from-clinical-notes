Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, were within normal limits during follow-up.

In conclusion, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia who is planning to undergo gallbladder removal surgery. His preoperative assessment revealed stable vital signs and well-controlled chronic conditions. Postoperatively, the patient had an unremarkable recovery course without any complications.
