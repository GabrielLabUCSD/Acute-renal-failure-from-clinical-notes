The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, he has a history of smoking for 20 years but has been tobacco-free for the past five years. The patient is currently taking metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin to manage his chronic conditions. He has not experienced any recent hospitalizations or surgeries.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. His electrocardiogram showed no evidence of any cardiac abnormalities.

Given the patient's medical history, the surgery team discussed the importance of perioperative management of his chronic conditions. The patient was advised to continue taking his regular medications, including metformin, until the morning of surgery. He was instructed to withhold food and drink after midnight on the day of surgery to prevent any potential complications during anesthesia.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient underwent an uneventful procedure lasting approximately two hours. Postoperatively, he was transferred to the recovery room and his vital signs remained stable. He was closely monitored for pain control and adequate fluid intake.

During his postoperative course, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any potential surgical site infections. The surgical wound was assessed regularly for signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative pain was managed with a combination of oral analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia. His pain scores remained well-controlled throughout his hospital stay. He was also closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of postoperative ileus and given appropriate prophylaxis.

Despite meticulous postoperative care, the patient developed a superficial surgical site infection. The wound appeared erythematous and there was minimal purulent discharge. The surgery team promptly initiated antibiotic therapy and implemented wound care measures. The infection gradually improved, and the patient did not require any additional surgical interventions.

The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored in the postoperative period due to his history of diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy was initiated to maintain optimal glycemic control. His blood pressure was also monitored regularly to ensure it remained within the target range.

The patient's overall postoperative recovery was uncomplicated, and he was able to resume a regular diet within two days of surgery. Physical therapy was initiated to prevent muscle weakness and promote early ambulation. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate wound care instructions and a prescription for oral antibiotics to complete the course.

During his postoperative follow-up visit, the patient's surgical wound showed significant improvement without any signs of infection. He was advised to continue taking his regular medications and follow a healthy lifestyle to manage his chronic conditions effectively. The patient was also encouraged to schedule regular follow-up appointments with his primary care physician to ensure optimal long-term care.

In conclusion, the patient had a successful surgery with no intraoperative complications. However, he did develop a superficial surgical site infection in the postoperative period, which was promptly treated with antibiotics. The patient's overall postoperative course was uneventful, demonstrating appropriate management of his chronic conditions to ensure a smooth recovery.
