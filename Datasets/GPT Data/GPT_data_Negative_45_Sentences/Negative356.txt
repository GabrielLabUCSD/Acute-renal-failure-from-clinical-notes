They have a history of allergies, particularly to penicillin, and have had no adverse reactions to other medications in the past.

The patient has undergone previous surgeries, including appendectomy and gallbladder removal, without any complications. However, it is worth noting that they experienced prolonged wound healing after their appendectomy, possibly due to diabetes.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient mentioned that they frequently use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage occasional joint pain. This usage has not caused any significant adverse effects in the past.

The patient underwent surgery without any complications or reported difficulties with anesthesia. They received a general anesthesia and remained stable throughout the procedure. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for vital signs and pain management. The surgical wound was also assessed for any signs of infection.

No complications were observed during the immediate postoperative course. The patient's pain was well-managed with a combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics. There were no signs of wound infection or dehiscence. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and follow a respiratory care plan, including deep breathing exercises and use of an incentive spirometer.
