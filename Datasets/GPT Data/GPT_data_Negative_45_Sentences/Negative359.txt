The patient is a 65-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been on medications for these conditions, including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He reports a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. He denies any current alcohol or illicit drug use.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy in his 20s and a cholecystectomy in his 40s. Both surgeries were unremarkable without any complications. He reported being allergic to penicillin, which causes a rash.

During the preoperative evaluation, his blood pressure was slightly elevated but otherwise within normal limits. His laboratory results revealed a fasting blood glucose of 140 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 7.5%, and a total cholesterol level of 210 mg/dL with LDL of 150 mg/dL and HDL of 40 mg/dL. The patient was advised to continue his current medications and monitor his blood glucose. Additionally, he was recommended to start preoperative deep breathing exercises to prepare for the surgery.

The patient underwent successful surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure lasted around three hours and involved a midline abdominal incision. The surgeon reported no intraoperative complications. The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring following the surgery.

In the PACU, the patient was initially stable with blood pressure ranging from 120/70 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 80 bpm. However, he did experience some postoperative pain which was effectively managed with analgesics. His oxygen saturation remained above 95% on room air. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and ambulate as tolerated to prevent potential complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. His pain was well controlled with oral pain medications, and he did not experience any wound complications such as infection or dehiscence. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and did not have any issues with bowel movements. He was closely monitored for signs of infection, deep vein thrombosis, or respiratory complications.

The patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day. He was given instructions on wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. He was advised to continue his regular medications and follow up with his primary care physician and surgeon for postoperative visits. The patient was also recommended to schedule a follow-up appointment with the anesthesiologist to evaluate and manage his surgical stress-induced hyperglycemia.

No significant complications were noted during the postoperative course. The patient did not experience any acute renal failure, which is a commonly recognized complication associated with anesthesia and surgery. However, he did develop a mild surgical site infection a week after discharge, which was treated effectively with antibiotics and wound care. The infection resolved without further complications. The patient's blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid levels were measured during his follow-up visits and remained within target ranges. He was counseled on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and medication adherence, to manage his underlying medical conditions and prevent future complications.
