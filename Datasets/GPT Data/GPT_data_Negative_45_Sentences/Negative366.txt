The patient is a 65-year-old female who is planning to undergo surgery. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension, asthma, and osteoarthritis. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications and uses an inhaler for her asthma symptoms. She has reported occasional joint pain and stiffness due to osteoarthritis, which is managed with over-the-counter pain relievers.

The patient denies any known drug allergies and does not smoke or consume alcohol. She has no family history of surgical complications or adverse drug reactions. Physical examination reveals well-controlled blood pressure and normal lung function. The patient is mentally alert and oriented.

Laboratory investigations show a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. Her renal function is within the normal range with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 80 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient has consulted with her surgeon, who has explained the necessity of surgery and the potential risks involved. The patient understands the procedure and the need for anesthesia. She has provided informed consent for the surgery.

To prepare for surgery, the patient has been asked to stop taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) one week before the procedure. She has been educated on the importance of maintaining her blood pressure within normal limits and has been instructed to continue her antihypertensive medication. The patient has been advised to follow preoperative fasting protocols and to shower with an antibacterial soap the night before the surgery.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrives at the hospital on time and is taken to the preoperative area. An intravenous line is initiated, and general anesthesia is administered. The procedure is performed without any complications and lasts approximately two hours. The surgical team ensures adequate pain control during the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient is monitored closely in the recovery room. Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are stable. The patient is awake and responsive as the anesthesia wears off. She is provided with pain medications as needed and encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experiences some pain at the surgical site, which is adequately managed with intravenous and oral analgesics. The surgical wound is assessed for signs of infection, and appropriate care is provided. The patient is encouraged to mobilize and engage in physical therapy to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Over the next few days, the patient's pain gradually subsides, and she is transitioned to oral pain medications. Her vital signs remain stable, and she is encouraged to maintain good hydration and nutrition. The patient is started on a prophylactic antibiotic regimen to prevent surgical site infection.

On the third day postoperatively, the patient complains of constipation, which is managed with stool softeners and increased fluid intake. Her bowel movements gradually return to normal.

The patient's recovery progresses uneventfully, and she is discharged from the hospital on the fifth day postoperatively. She is given appropriate discharge instructions and provided with a follow-up appointment with her surgeon. The patient is advised to continue taking her antihypertensive medication, perform light exercises, and gradually increase activity levels as tolerated. She is also counseled on nutrition, wound care, and signs of infection or complications.

During the postoperative course, the patient does not experience any major complications such as wound dehiscence, deep surgical site infections, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction. However, the patient does develop a urinary tract infection four weeks after surgery, which is treated with an appropriate antibiotic. Her renal function remains stable throughout the postoperative period. The patient continues to do well and resumes her normal activities of daily living after complete recovery from surgery.
