The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well-controlled with medications. He presents with severe arthritis in his right knee, causing significant pain and mobility issues. Physical therapy and conservative measures have not provided sufficient relief, so he is now considering surgical intervention.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy during childhood and a cholecystectomy 10 years ago for acute cholecystitis. Neither procedure was complicated, and he recovered well from both surgeries. There have been no other surgical interventions to date.

The patient's medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He does not smoke and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. He exercises regularly and follows a well-balanced diet. Allergies include penicillin and sulfa medications, but there have been no adverse reactions reported.

His current medications include lisinopril for hypertension and simvastatin for hyperlipidemia. Both medications have been stable for several years. He reports no recent changes in his medication regimen.

Physical examination reveals significant joint deformity, tenderness, and limited range of motion in the affected knee. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count and metabolic panel, are within normal limits. Imaging studies confirm severe osteoarthritis with bone-on-bone contact, supporting the need for surgical intervention.

The patient's surgical plan involves a total knee replacement (TKR). Preoperative consultations with the orthopedic surgeon, anesthesiologist, and primary care physician have been completed. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia, and the patient has been thoroughly informed about the risks and benefits.

In terms of the postoperative course, he will be closely monitored in the recovery room for the initial hours. Pain control will be managed with intravenous opioids initially and then transitioned to oral analgesics as tolerated. Physical therapy and mobilization will begin on the first postoperative day to encourage early ambulation and joint movement.

Complications that could arise postoperatively include infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), implant loosening, and joint instability. However, the patient will receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery to minimize the risk of infection. Mechanical DVT prophylaxis will also be initiated to prevent clot formation.

Early ambulation, range of motion exercises, and physical therapy will help prevent implant loosening and joint instability. The patient will be instructed in proper wound care, signs of infection, and when to seek medical attention.

During the hospital stay, the patientâ€™s vital signs will be closely monitored, along with wound healing and pain management. Radiological imaging may be performed to assess the positioning and integrity of the prosthesis.

If all goes well, the patient is expected to have significant pain relief and improvement in joint function postoperatively. Rehabilitation will be continued as an outpatient, involving regular physical therapy sessions and home exercises. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess progress and address any concerns.

In summary, a 55-year-old male with a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia is planning to undergo a total knee replacement due to severe arthritis. He has a surgical history of appendectomy and cholecystectomy, with uneventful recoveries. His medication regimen includes lisinopril and simvastatin, both unchanged. The patient is in overall good health, does not smoke or use illicit drugs, and exercises regularly. The surgical plan has been established and informed consent obtained. Postoperatively, he will be monitored closely for pain control and complications such as infection, DVT, implant loosening, and joint instability. Early mobilization, physical therapy, and proper wound care will be essential for optimal recovery. The patient is expected to have a significant improvement in pain and joint function, but complications will be monitored throughout the postoperative course.
