Patient X is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who is now planning to have surgery. He has been experiencing symptoms of shortness of breath upon exertion, fatigue, and chest discomfort. He takes medications for his hypertension and his cholesterol levels are well-controlled with statins.

His surgical history includes an appendectomy performed 20 years ago and a hernia repair 5 years ago, both of which were uneventful. He has no known drug allergies and does not smoke or consume alcohol excessively. His family history is significant for heart disease in his father, who had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.

In terms of his cardiovascular health, the patient had an exercise stress test six months ago, which was positive for ischemic changes. Subsequently, he underwent a coronary angiogram, which revealed a 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. He was advised to have a coronary artery bypass graft surgery to improve blood flow to his heart. However, due to his symptoms and the severity of the stenosis, the surgery was put on hold to optimize his medical condition first.

On further evaluation, an echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% with no regional wall motion abnormalities. His pulmonary function tests were within normal limits, and his liver and kidney function tests were also unremarkable. He was started on beta-blockers and aspirin prior to surgery.

Three weeks ago, the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The surgical procedure involved using a saphenous vein graft to bypass the blocked left anterior descending artery. He tolerated the surgery well and was extubated on postoperative day one. His vital signs remained stable, with blood pressure controlled and no signs of postoperative bleeding.

In the postoperative course, the patient started physical therapy the day after the surgery to gradually mobilize and regain strength. His pain was effectively managed with analgesics, and he was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and atelectasis.

The patient remained in the hospital for five days after the surgery, during which time his surgical incisions were monitored for signs of infection. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. No wound complications were noted, and his incisions were healing well.

As for any complications, the patient did experience atrial fibrillation on the second postoperative day, which was managed with antiarrhythmic medications and electrical cardioversion. His rhythm reverted to normal sinus rhythm, and he remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of his hospital stay.

His renal function remained within normal limits throughout the postoperative period, and he did not experience any signs of acute renal failure. His urine output was adequate, and there were no electrolyte imbalances observed.

In terms of his postoperative care plan, the patient was discharged with instructions to continue taking his prescribed medications, including antiplatelet agents and beta-blockers. He was advised to gradually increase physical activity over the next few weeks, as tolerated. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for six weeks after the surgery to assess his surgical wounds and overall recovery.

In summary, Patient X, a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery three weeks ago. His surgery was uneventful, and he had no wound complications. He experienced atrial fibrillation, which was successfully managed, and his renal function remained unaffected. The patient was discharged with a favorable postoperative course, and his follow-up appointment is scheduled for six weeks from the surgery date.
