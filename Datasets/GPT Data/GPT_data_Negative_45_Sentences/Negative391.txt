The patient, a 60-year-old male, has a significant medical history leading up to his planned surgery. He has a past diagnosis of hypertension, which is well-controlled on a stable medication regimen. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which he takes a statin. Additionally, the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a BMI of 32, reflecting obesity.

The patient has reported occasional episodes of chest discomfort, concerning for angina. He has undergone an exercise stress test, which revealed evidence of reversible myocardial ischemia. A coronary angiogram was subsequently performed, indicating significant stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery. As a result, the patient is scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient's baseline hemoglobin A1c level is 7.2%, reflecting fair glycemic control. He is instructed to continue his oral hypoglycemic agents until the day of surgery. His blood pressure is stable on antihypertensive medication, aiming to maintain his values below 130/80 mmHg. His lipid profile reveals well-controlled levels, with LDL cholesterol within the target range.

The patient is also on regular aspirin therapy for secondary prevention due to a previous history of myocardial infarction. He is advised to discontinue aspirin five days prior to the surgery to prevent excessive perioperative bleeding.

During the surgery, the patient undergoes CABG with the use of a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery. The surgery proceeds without any significant intraoperative complications, and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative monitoring.

In the ICU, the patient is extubated and maintained on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. He is monitored closely for pain control, and a multimodal approach is utilized, combining intravenous opioids with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen.

The patient's vital signs remain stable throughout the postoperative period, without any significant fluctuations. He maintains adequate urine output, and his fluid balance is carefully managed. Serial electrocardiograms are obtained to monitor for any new cardiac ischemic changes.

Within the first 24 hours postoperatively, the patient starts ambulating with physical therapy assistance. His pain is well-controlled, and he is able to tolerate a regular diet. His glucose levels are monitored closely, and insulin sliding scale is utilized to maintain optimal glycemic control.

On postoperative day 2, the patient develops a low-grade fever, attributed to post-surgical inflammation. His chest incision is inspected and reveals no signs of infection or dehiscence. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated empirically to cover potential sources of infection.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient demonstrates gradual improvement in ambulation and functional status. He successfully completes his cardiac rehabilitation program and is discharged home with specific discharge instructions.

The patient's postoperative recovery at home is generally uneventful. He complies with his medication regimen, including beta-blockers, antiplatelets, statins, and his antihypertensive agents. His glucose levels remain within target ranges, with regular glucose monitoring and adjustment of his oral hypoglycemic agents.

Despite appropriate prophylaxis, the patient does develop an incisional surgical site infection on postoperative day 10. The infection involves the superficial layers and is managed with local wound care, oral antibiotics, and regular follow-up with his surgeon.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course is characterized by successful recovery with resolution of chest discomfort and improved exercise tolerance. He attends regular follow-up appointments with his cardiologist and surgeon for continued monitoring and optimization of his cardiovascular health.
