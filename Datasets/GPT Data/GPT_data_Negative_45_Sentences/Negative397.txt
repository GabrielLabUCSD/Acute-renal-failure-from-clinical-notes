The patient, a 60-year-old male, has a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been taking antihypertensive medications for the past five years, including amlodipine and lisinopril, which have been well controlled. His dyslipidemia is managed with atorvastatin. The patient has been on metformin for the past ten years to control his diabetes and maintains good glycemic control with a recent HbA1c of 6.7%.

The patient is now scheduled to undergo an elective surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis in the left knee. The surgery is necessary to alleviate chronic pain and improve his overall quality of life. The patient has been thoroughly evaluated preoperatively, including cardiovascular assessment, pulmonary function tests, and a complete blood count. These tests revealed no significant abnormalities, and the patient has received medical clearance for surgery.

He underwent the surgery under general anesthesia with no reported intraoperative complications. The procedure lasted approximately two hours and was performed by an orthopedic surgeon with extensive experience in joint replacement surgeries. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

In the PACU, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was closely monitored for pain management and early mobilization. He was started on intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids to control postoperative pain. Physical therapy initiated on the day of the surgery to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and assist in early mobilization.

During his postoperative course, the patient's pain was adequately managed, and he reported significant improvement in the left knee pain compared to before the surgery. The patient's vital signs remained stable, with no signs of infection or wound complications noted. He was closely monitored for any signs of deep vein thrombosis and was placed on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day three. Before discharge, he received detailed instructions on wound care, pain management, and exercises to improve knee strength and range of motion. The patient was also advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient to optimize his knee function.

In the following months, the patient attended regular follow-up appointments. He reported gradual improvement in his knee function, with increased mobility and decreased pain. No signs of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence were observed during these visits. The patient continued his regular medications, and his blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained well-controlled.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, with no significant complications noted. He experienced an unremarkable postoperative course and achieved the desired outcome of improved knee function and diminished pain. The patient's diligent adherence to medical advice, including physical therapy, plays a crucial role in the successful recovery following surgery.
