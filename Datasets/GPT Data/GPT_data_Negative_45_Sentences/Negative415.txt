The patient undergoing surgery is a 55-year-old male who has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been managing his conditions well with medications, including lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and albuterol inhaler as needed. His blood pressure has been consistently controlled with lisinopril, and his blood glucose levels are within target range with metformin. He also follows a healthy diet and exercises regularly.

The patient's surgical indication is a scheduled elective knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. He has been experiencing significant knee pain, limited range of motion, and difficulty with mobility. Conservative management including physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were unsuccessful in providing long-term pain relief.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, which were within normal limits. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated as 82 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating normal renal function.

In terms of preoperative medications, the patient was instructed to discontinue aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs one week prior to surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding. He was given specific instructions regarding fasting and medication administration on the day of the surgery.

The patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia and received appropriate prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively. The surgery was uneventful, with no intraoperative complications reported. The surgical team utilized a posterior-stabilized total knee replacement procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition. He received standard postoperative pain management with intravenous opioids initially, followed by transition to oral pain medications. The patient was mobilized on the first postoperative day with the assistance of physical therapy to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was afebrile. Routine blood tests were ordered, including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, which showed no significant abnormalities. His postoperative course was unremarkable.

The patient was closely monitored for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or drainage at the surgical site. No signs of infection were noted, and the wound incision appeared to be healing properly without any signs of dehiscence or necrosis.

To prevent deep vein thrombosis, the patient received prophylactic low molecular weight heparin injections daily. Sequential compression devices were applied to his lower extremities during the hospital stay. He was also encouraged to perform leg exercises and ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient's pain was well-controlled, and he was able to participate in physical therapy sessions to facilitate his postoperative recovery. While he experienced some expected postoperative discomfort and swelling, these symptoms gradually improved.

There were no complications during the patient's hospital stay. He had maintained adequate urinary output, with no signs of acute renal failure. His laboratory values, including serum creatinine levels, remained stable throughout his postoperative course.

Upon discharge, the patient was provided with instructions for wound care, pain management, and physical therapy exercises to be continued at home. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a postoperative visit.

During the scheduled postoperative visit, the patient reported overall improvement in pain control and an increase in mobility. The wound incision appeared to be healing without any signs of infection or complications. He continued to take his medications regularly and remained compliant with his prescribed treatment plan.

In summary, the patient undergoing knee replacement surgery had a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and mild COPD. His preoperative course was uneventful, with no significant abnormalities noted in the laboratory tests. The surgery was performed without complications or intraoperative incidents.

Postoperatively, the patient had an unremarkable recovery. He experienced expected postoperative pain and swelling, which improved over time. No signs of infection or wound complications were observed. The patient was effectively managed with pain medications and physical therapy, facilitating his postoperative rehabilitation.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, and he did not experience any significant complications, including acute renal failure.
