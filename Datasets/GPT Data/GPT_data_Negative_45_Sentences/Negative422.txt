The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant medical history. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, all of which are well-controlled with medications. He is an ex-smoker and currently does not consume alcohol. The patient has a family history of heart disease, but no significant family history of any other medical conditions. 

The patient is currently planning to have surgery, but the exact type of surgery is not specified. However, given his medical history, it is important to take certain precautions. Prior to the surgery, the patient's blood pressure should be carefully monitored to ensure it is under control. Additionally, his blood glucose levels should be carefully managed to prevent any postoperative complications related to his diabetes. 

In terms of his postoperative course, the patient is expected to recover well. However, there is a possibility of complications due to his history of hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, close monitoring of his blood pressure and blood glucose levels will be crucial during the postoperative period. 

If any complications arise, prompt intervention will be necessary. However, it is important to note that acute renal failure is not expected to be a complication in this patient's case. Other potential complications could include wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia. These should be actively monitored for and managed if they occur. 

Overall, the patient's medical history and pre-surgery preparations suggest that he is at a higher risk for certain postoperative complications. However, with proper monitoring and management, his postoperative course is expected to be smooth.
