20. Intraoperative findings revealed severe osteoarthritis in both knees, necessitating the use of prosthetic components.
21. The surgery was performed without complications and lasted approximately four hours.
22. The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.
23. In the PACU, her vital signs were monitored closely, and pain control was achieved through intravenous analgesics.

38. Six weeks after surgery, the patient reported full range of motion in her knees and minimal pain.
39. Radiographs taken at the follow-up appointment confirmed proper alignment and positioning of the prosthetic components.
40. No signs of complications such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, or implant failure were noted.
41. At the six-month follow-up, the patient reported being able to perform daily activities with minimal difficulty.
42. Repeat imaging showed continued satisfactory positioning of the prosthetic components.
43. There were no signs of loosening or wear of the implants.
