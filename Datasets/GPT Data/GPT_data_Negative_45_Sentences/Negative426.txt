The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently managed on medication for both conditions, and his blood pressure and blood glucose levels are well controlled. 

Mr. Smith is now planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. His surgical history includes an appendectomy 10 years ago without any complications. He has no known drug allergies. 

In addition to his chronic conditions, Mr. Smith has a history of smoking. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. This places him at an increased risk for postoperative complications such as delayed wound healing and respiratory issues.

Preoperatively, Mr. Smith underwent a thorough medical evaluation. His physical examination revealed normal vital signs, except for a slightly elevated blood pressure. Laboratory investigations showed a fasting blood glucose level within the target range. His renal function, liver function, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits.

Given his hypertension, Mr. Smith's antihypertensive medications were continued up until the day of surgery. He was advised to take all his medications with a small sip of water on the morning of the procedure. The surgeon also recommended stopping smoking at least two weeks before surgery to reduce the risk of complications.

On the day of surgery, Mr. Smith was admitted to the hospital. He underwent general anesthesia and surgery proceeded without any complications. The hernia repair was successful, and no intraoperative complications were reported.

Postoperatively, Mr. Smith was closely observed in the recovery room. He was initially stable, with normal vital signs and satisfactory pain control. He was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to regular food as tolerated. The surgical wound was clean, dry, and intact without any signs of infection.

During his hospital stay, efforts were made to promote early ambulation and prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. Mr. Smith received deep breathing exercises and was encouraged to do leg exercises.

Mr. Smith's recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day. He was given instructions for wound care and pain management at home. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting, straining, and smoking for the next six weeks to aid in the healing process.

In the immediate postoperative period, Mr. Smith did not experience any complications such as surgical site infection, wound dehiscence, or seroma formation. He followed up with his surgeon as scheduled and was noted to have good wound healing progress.

In the weeks following surgery, Mr. Smith reported a gradual improvement in his pain and ability to perform daily activities. He continued to monitor his blood pressure and blood glucose levels, which remained stable.

Overall, Mr. Smith's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he had a successful hernia repair. He had no major complications during his hospital stay or in the weeks following surgery.

It is important to note that while Mr. Smith did not experience acute renal failure as a complication, this does not mean that he was not at risk for it. Given his medical history of hypertension and diabetes, close monitoring of his renal function is essential to identify any potential complications in the future.
