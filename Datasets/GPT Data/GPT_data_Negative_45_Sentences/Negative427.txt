This patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been on Lisinopril and Metformin for the management of his conditions.

His surgical history includes an appendectomy at age 20 and bilateral cataract surgery at age 40. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

The patient's preoperative laboratory work-up revealed a fasting blood glucose of 148 mg/dL, hemoglobin level of 14 g/dL, and a baseline creatinine level of 0.98 mg/dL. His electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were within normal limits.

He met with the anesthesiologist and was deemed fit for surgery. The anesthesiologist recommended general anesthesia for the procedure. Additionally, the patient was advised to discontinue his Metformin two days prior to surgery.

On the day of surgery, the patient presented to the hospital fasting and received an intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis with Cefazolin. A peripheral intravenous line was established, and the patient was monitored by continuous electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and non-invasive blood pressure measurement.

The hernia repair surgery was uneventful. The Surgeon utilized a tension-free technique, placing a mesh to reinforce the defect and reduce the risk of recurrence. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remained stable. He was able to void normally and had no signs of urinary retention. The nurse provided analgesia as per the surgeon's orders, and the patient reported his pain as well controlled.

The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent the development of postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was started on a clear liquid diet, and his blood glucose levels were monitored closely.

On the first postoperative day, the patient continued to progress well. He had no signs of wound infection or significant swelling. The nurse removed his urinary catheter, and he was able to ambulate without assistance. He was advanced to a regular diet, and his pain was controlled with oral analgesics.

The patient's postoperative course remained uneventful. He was discharged home on postoperative day two with instructions to continue his normal oral medications. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous physical activity for the next two weeks.

During his follow-up appointment, the patient reported no complications or issues with his surgical incision. His blood glucose levels remained within the target range, and his blood pressure was adequately controlled. The surgeon examined the incision site, which appeared well-healed without signs of infection or dehiscence.

In summary, this 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes underwent an uneventful inguinal hernia repair surgery. His postoperative course was marked by adequate pain control, early ambulation, and return of normal bowel and bladder function. The patient did not experience any complications related to the surgery, such as wound infection or urinary retention. He was discharged home on postoperative day two and had a favorable outcome without acute renal failure.
