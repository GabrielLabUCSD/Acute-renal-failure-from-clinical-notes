Treatment plan includes a comprehensive preoperative evaluation and optimization of his medical conditions. The anesthesia team will be involved to ensure his safety during surgery. The patient will be instructed to discontinue anticoagulant medications such as aspirin and any herbal supplements. He will receive preoperative antibiotics according to institutional protocols to reduce the risk of surgical site infections.

Postoperatively, the patient will receive attentive pain management, including the use of opioid and non-opioid analgesics. He will undergo physical therapy to minimize complications such as deep vein thrombosis and postoperative pneumonia. Regular monitoring of vital signs, wound healing, and mobility will be carried out. Deep breathing exercises and ambulation will be encouraged to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with no major surgical complications observed. He does not experience acute renal failure. His pain is effectively managed, and he achieves adequate mobilization within the expected timeframe. Drains and catheters are successfully removed, and his overall recovery progresses smoothly.

Given his baseline medical condition and optimized perioperative care, the patient successfully regains his independence and is discharged from the hospital. Close follow-up is planned to monitor his healing progress and manage any potential long-term complications associated with the surgery.
