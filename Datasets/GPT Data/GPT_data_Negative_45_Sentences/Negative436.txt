The patient is a 68-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a knee replacement. He has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The patient has been on metformin for diabetes management with good glycemic control. His blood pressure has been well-controlled on lisinopril, and his cholesterol levels have been maintained within normal limits with atorvastatin.

In addition to his medical conditions, the patient has a history of cigarette smoking, but he quit smoking 10 years ago. He has no known allergies to medications and denies any prior surgical interventions. The patient's baseline renal function is within normal range, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 78 mL/min/1.73 mÂ².

On physical examination, the patient is found to be overweight with a body mass index of 31. He has an antalgic gait and limited range of motion in his affected knee. No other abnormal findings are noted on examination.

Preoperatively, the patient's lab work showed normal hemoglobin, electrolyte, and coagulation profiles. His fasting blood glucose levels were well-controlled. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were within normal limits.

The patient underwent the knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative complications. The surgeon reported that the procedure went smoothly, and a prosthetic knee was successfully implanted. The patient tolerated the surgery well under general anesthesia and was subsequently transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit.

During the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored for pain control and respiratory function. He received intravenous opioid analgesics initially and then transitioned to oral pain medication. Physical therapy was initiated early to minimize postoperative complications and promote joint mobility.

The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker on the first postoperative day. He followed a progressive exercise regimen to regain functional range of motion and strength in the operated knee. Vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of infection at the surgical site.

Complications commonly associated with surgery, such as wound dehiscence, infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, did not occur in this patient. He did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of acute kidney injury during the postoperative period. The patient's glycemic control remained stable, and there were no episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day with instructions for wound care, pain management, and physical therapy. He was advised to continue taking his regular medications and to closely monitor his blood glucose levels. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks post-discharge to assess the surgical site and evaluate the patient's progress.

In conclusion, the patient successfully underwent knee replacement surgery without any significant intraoperative or postoperative complications. His medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia were well-managed preoperatively, contributing to a smooth surgical course. Postoperatively, the patient demonstrated satisfactory joint function and recovery. His renal function remained stable, and he did not experience any complications typically associated with surgery.
