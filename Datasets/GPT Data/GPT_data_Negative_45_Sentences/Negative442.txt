The patient is a 62-year-old female who is planning to have surgery for an undisclosed condition. She has a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Her diabetes is well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, and her blood pressure is well-managed with an angiotensin receptor blocker and a diuretic. She also has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the past.

The patient has been on aspirin and clopidogrel for secondary prevention since her PCI. She denies any recent cardiac symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. She does not have a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Her surgical team is aware of her cardiovascular history and plan to continue her antiplatelet therapy perioperatively for her surgical procedure.

She had a routine preoperative evaluation, which included laboratory investigations including a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, kidney function tests, coagulation profile, and a chest x-ray. Her laboratory results were within normal limits, with no significant abnormalities.

The patient's preoperative cardiac evaluation included an electrocardiogram, which showed sinus rhythm without any acute changes. Additionally, an echocardiogram was performed, revealing normal left ventricular function with no significant valvular abnormalities or evidence of right heart strain.

She does not smoke and denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse. She has a family history of diabetes and hypertension but no significant family history of cardiovascular disease or clotting disorders.

The patient has had previous surgeries in the past, including a cholecystectomy and an appendectomy, both uneventful with no complications. She did not experience any issues with anesthesia during those procedures. Her surgical team has reviewed her records and communicated with the anesthesiologist regarding her prior experiences.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrives in stable condition, with vital signs within normal limits. She is appropriately fasting and has received preoperative medications as per the protocol for her surgical procedure.

The surgery proceeds uneventfully, lasting approximately three hours. The anesthesiologist monitors the patient closely throughout the procedure, ensuring adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic stability. She receives appropriate prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis with sequential compression devices and pharmacologic agents.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is transferred to the recovery room, where she is closely monitored for signs of complications such as respiratory distress, hypotension, or bleeding. She is initially awake and responsive, with stable vital signs. Her pain is managed with intravenous opioids, and she receives intravenous fluids to maintain hydration.

The patient remains under observation for 24 hours, with regular assessments of her vital signs, pain level, and urine output. She is transitioned from intravenous pain medications to oral analgesics, and her diet is advanced as tolerated.

The patient does not experience any immediate postoperative complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or respiratory complications. She does not develop any signs of infection or thromboembolism, such as fever or leg swelling.

She is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pneumonia. Physical therapy provides her with instructions on breathing exercises, leg exercises, and general mobility to promote healing and prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course is generally uneventful. On the second postoperative day, she is discharged home with instructions for wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments with her surgical team and primary care physician.

Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor her surgical site and evaluate her overall recovery. The patient is advised to report any signs of infection, bleeding, or worsening pain. She is also informed about the importance of continuing her regular medications, including her antiplatelet therapy.

The patient demonstrates good compliance with her postoperative care plan and follows up as scheduled. At her follow-up appointments, her surgical site is healing well without signs of infection, and she reports a significant reduction in pain. Her vital signs remain stable, and she is satisfied with her surgical outcome.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course is free from complications. She does not experience any acute kidney injury, but it should be noted that acute renal failure was not listed as a potential complication to exclude. She is pleased with her surgical procedure and maintains a positive outlook on her overall health.
