The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been managed with medications and lifestyle modifications. The patient has a surgical history of appendectomy 10 years ago.

He is currently scheduled for surgery to repair a hernia. Preoperative evaluation showed no significant abnormalities on physical examination except for the hernia. Labs revealed slightly elevated cholesterol levels, which were attributed to his underlying hyperlipidemia.

The patient has been on lisinopril for his hypertension and atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia, both of which are being continued. His diabetes is managed with metformin, and it will be temporarily discontinued on the day of surgery. He is currently stable on this regimen and has good glycemic control.

In terms of allergies, the patient has a documented allergy to penicillin, which has been noted in his medical records. All necessary precautions will be taken to avoid any potential allergic reactions during his hospital stay.

During the preoperative counseling, the patient expressed concerns about postoperative pain management. The surgical team discussed the options with the patient, including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures. The patient opted for a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics for postoperative pain control.

On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room and underwent hernia repair under general anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful, lasting approximately two hours. There were no intraoperative complications, and the patient tolerated the anesthesia well.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room. His vital signs remained stable, and his pain was well controlled with the prescribed analgesics. He was able to ambulate and tolerate a regular diet without any issues.

The patient was started on prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery, following institutional guidelines for surgical site infection prevention. The antibiotics were continued for 24 hours postoperatively. There were no signs of infection or wound complications on examination.

As part of routine care, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was initiated, consisting of intermittent pneumatic compression devices and early mobilization. The patient was educated about the importance of ambulation and maintaining adequate hydration to prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and he was discharged home on the second postoperative day with appropriate pain medications and wound care instructions. He was also provided with written materials for self-monitoring and instructions to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks.

There were no immediate complications noted during the postoperative period. The patient experienced expected pain at the surgical site, which was managed effectively with the prescribed analgesics. He was instructed to notify the surgical team if there were any signs of infection or worsening pain.

At the two-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported improvement in his symptoms with complete resolution of the initial hernia-related complaints. His surgical wound appeared to be healing well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient was pleased with the outcome of the procedure and was advised to continue his regular medications and lifestyle modifications.

In summary, this 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent successful hernia repair surgery without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. His postoperative course was unremarkable, with adequate pain control, and he was able to return to his regular activities within a few days. The patient's surgical wound healed well, and he had no signs of infection or other complications during the two-week follow-up period.
