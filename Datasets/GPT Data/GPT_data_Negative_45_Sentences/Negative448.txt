Patient X is a 62-year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He is currently stable on metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. The patient has a history of previous myocardial infarction with percutaneous coronary intervention involving stent placement. His preoperative labs showed a fasting blood glucose of 140 mg/dL and HbA1c of 7.5%, which are slightly elevated but well-controlled.

In addition to his cardiac history, the patient has a long-standing history of osteoarthritis in the knees, which has significantly impacted his quality of life. Non-surgical management including analgesics, physical therapy, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been ineffective. As a result, a decision was made for the patient to undergo bilateral total knee replacement surgery to alleviate his pain and improve functionality.

On the day of surgery, the patient received appropriate preoperative anesthesia evaluation and counseling. General anesthesia was administered, and the patient was positioned appropriately for the procedure. Preoperative antibiotics were given in accordance with surgical site infection prevention protocols. The procedure involved sequential bilateral total knee replacement with implantation of prosthetic components. Intraoperatively, the patient tolerated the procedure without any significant complications, and estimated blood loss was minimal.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and closely monitored. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation remained stable throughout the immediate postoperative period. Intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were administered for pain control. Physical therapy was initiated early on to encourage early mobilization and prevent postoperative complications.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He experienced the expected postoperative pain, which was managed effectively with the prescribed pain regimen. Serial laboratory values including complete blood counts, electrolytes, and renal function remained within normal limits. There was no evidence of wound infection or thromboembolic events. The patient's incisions were clean, dry, and intact, and there was no drainage or erythema noted.

On postoperative day 3, the patient was transferred to the orthopedic floor for continued monitoring and rehabilitation. He was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist and perform activities of daily living with minimal assistance. The patient's pain was well-controlled, and his overall progress was satisfactory. There were no signs or symptoms of surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism observed.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient closely followed the prescribed medication regimen, including prophylactic antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis. He was also counseled on the importance of maintaining glycemic control during the perioperative period. Nutritional support was provided to ensure proper wound healing.

At the time of discharge, the patient was able to ambulate independently and had minimal pain at rest. He was given a prescription for oral analgesics for home use and scheduled for follow-up visits with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon. The patient and his family were educated on postoperative wound care and signs of potential complications, including infection, thromboembolic events, and urinary retention.

Overall, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery with a smooth postoperative course. He did not experience any complications related to the surgery or anesthesia. It is important for the patient to continue adhering to his medication regimen, attending rehabilitation sessions, and closely monitoring for any signs of infection or other postoperative complications to ensure a full recovery.
