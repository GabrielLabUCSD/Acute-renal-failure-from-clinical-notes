Patient X is a 65-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain and a history of gallstones. Initial assessment revealed cholecystitis, and the decision was made to proceed with cholecystectomy surgery. The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well-controlled with medication.

The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy successfully, with no intraoperative complications. Preoperative lab work revealed normal liver enzymes and complete blood count. The surgery lasted approximately two hours, and the patient tolerated it well.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day one. Pain management was controlled with oral analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. His incisions were clean, dry, and intact upon discharge. He was instructed to follow a low-fat diet and activity restrictions as instructed by the surgeon.

During postoperative follow-up visits, the patient reported minimal pain and had good wound healing. No signs of wound infection or dehiscence were noted. D-dimer levels were monitored postoperatively but remained within normal limits. The patient was instructed on gradual return to normal activities and to report any worsening pain or fever.

The patient did not develop any immediate complications such as surgical site infections, hemorrhage, or bile duct injury. His vital signs remained stable throughout the hospital stay, with no signs of postoperative bleeding or infection. He did not require any blood transfusion or readmission during the follow-up period.
