The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He has been taking medication for these conditions regularly. He had a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery at that time. He has been relatively stable since then and is currently on aspirin and a statin.

The patient was recently diagnosed with symptomatic gallstones after experiencing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. As a result, he has been advised by the surgeon to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Preoperatively, a complete blood count, coagulation profile, liver function tests, and renal function tests were conducted, all of which were within the normal range. The patient also underwent an electrocardiogram, which showed no significant abnormalities, and a chest x-ray, which was unremarkable.

During the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the patient was placed under general anesthesia. The surgical procedure was uneventful, and the gallbladder, which contained multiple calculi, was successfully removed. The intraoperative course was without any complications, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Postoperatively, the patient received routine pain control using opioid analgesics and was started on a clear liquid diet within a few hours. He was closely monitored for any signs of complications, including wound infection, intra-abdominal bleeding, or bile duct injury. The surgical site was inspected daily, and appropriate wound care was provided.

The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful. He was able to tolerate a regular diet within 24 hours and was discharged home on postoperative day 2. He was provided with instructions regarding wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. He was also advised to follow up with the surgeon for a wound check and further evaluation.

During the follow-up visit, the patient did not report any significant postoperative complications. His surgical incisions were healing well without signs of infection or dehiscence. He experienced minimal pain, which was adequately managed with over-the-counter analgesics. The surgeon also assessed his overall recovery and determined that he did not require any additional interventions or investigations.

In conclusion, this 65-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. His postoperative course was smooth, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 2 without any concerns. He had a successful recovery without any immediate complications.
