The patient is a 58-year-old male with a significant medical history. He has a long-standing diagnosis of hypertension, which is well-controlled on medications. He is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or substance abuse. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father and two siblings having coronary artery disease.

The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, diagnosed 10 years ago. He manages his blood sugar levels through diet and exercise. His last HbA1c level was 6.8%. He does not require insulin therapy at this time.

In addition, the patient has hyperlipidemia and takes a statin medication to control his cholesterol levels. His last lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL, LDL of 100 mg/dL, HDL of 50 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 120 mg/dL.

The patient underwent a cardiac stress test six months ago, which showed moderate inducible ischemia. He was referred for an invasive coronary angiography, which revealed triple-vessel coronary artery disease. The left main artery had 70% stenosis, the left anterior descending artery had 80% stenosis, and the right coronary artery had 90% stenosis.

Based on these findings, the patient was recommended for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. His preoperative assessment included an echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction of 45% with no regional wall motion abnormalities. His renal function was within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient was educated about the surgical procedure and took part in a preoperative cardiac rehabilitation program to optimize his physical fitness. He was also instructed to stop taking antiplatelet medications and received bridging therapy with heparin prior to the surgery.

The patient underwent CABG surgery two weeks ago. The procedure was successful, and he received four bypass grafts using the left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts. Intraoperatively, his ejection fraction was estimated to be around 40%.

Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He required mechanical ventilation for 24 hours and was extubated without any complications. His postoperative course remained uneventful, with stable vital signs and no signs of infection.

The patient was gradually weaned off intravenous medications and transitioned to oral medications. His pain was well-managed with analgesics. Chest x-rays showed good lung expansion, and he did not develop any signs of atelectasis or pneumonia.

The patient was mobilized with the help of physical therapy, starting from the second postoperative day. He walked short distances in the ICU and progressed to longer walks in the wards. He was also educated about deep breathing exercises and instructed to use an incentive spirometer.

His wounds showed good healing without signs of infection, and he did not experience any wound complications such as dehiscence or seroma formation. His drain output decreased gradually, and the drains were removed on the fourth postoperative day.

The patient's cardiac function was monitored closely during his hospital stay. Serial electrocardiograms showed no evidence of new ischemia or arrhythmias. He had stable troponin levels, with a peak of 2.3 ng/mL on the first postoperative day, which then gradually normalized.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was discharged home with detailed instructions on wound care, medication management, and cardiac rehabilitation. He was referred for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation to further optimize his physical fitness and reduce the risk of future cardiac events.

During the first postoperative month, the patient had regular follow-up appointments with his cardiologist. He reported good adherence to the prescribed medications, including aspirin, a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a statin. He did not experience any cardiac symptoms such as angina or dyspnea on exertion.

At the one-month follow-up, the patient underwent a stress echocardiogram, which showed improvement in his ejection fraction to 50%. The patient was pleased with his postoperative course and grateful for the successful surgery. He expressed a renewed commitment to adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle and adhering to his medication regimen.

Overall, the patient had a successful CABG surgery with an uneventful postoperative course. He did not develop any complications such as infection, atelectasis, or wound issues. His cardiac function improved, as evidenced by the increase in ejection fraction observed on follow-up imaging. His commitment to healthy habits and ongoing cardiac rehabilitation will likely contribute to a positive long-term prognosis.
