Patient's medical history prior to surgery: The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has been taking lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin for the control of his chronic conditions. The patient also has a past surgical history significant for appendectomy and cholecystectomy. He denies any known drug allergies.

In terms of his surgical indication, the patient is planning to undergo elective total knee replacement (TKR) due to severe osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain. The patient has been experiencing progressively worsening knee pain and difficulty with functional activities such as walking and climbing stairs. Conservative management options such as physical therapy, analgesics, and intra-articular injections have been unsuccessful in providing adequate relief.

Preoperatively, the patient was thoroughly evaluated by the orthopedic surgeon, including a comprehensive physical examination and imaging studies such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee joint. The patient was deemed suitable for surgery, and the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained, along with the postoperative course and potential complications.

Surgical procedure and anesthesia: The patient underwent uncomplicated total knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. The surgical procedure involved the removal of the damaged knee joint surfaces and replacement with prosthetic components consisting of a metal femoral component, tibial baseplate, and a plastic insert. The surgery was performed by an orthopedic surgeon experienced in joint replacement procedures.

Postoperative course: In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room for close monitoring. He received appropriate pain management, including intravenous analgesics and a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Physical therapy was initiated on the day of surgery to promote early mobilization and optimize functional recovery. The patient was instructed on deep breathing exercises and use of an incentive spirometer to prevent postoperative respiratory complications.

The patient remained in the hospital for a total of three days to ensure adequate pain control, wound healing, and functional progress. During the hospital stay, the patient's vital signs remained stable, with no signs of infection or acute complications. He was gradually weaned off intravenous medications and transitioned to oral pain medications before discharge.

Complications: The patient did not experience any major perioperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound infection, or delayed wound healing. He did not develop any acute renal failure during his hospital stay. However, the patient experienced mild postoperative swelling and bruising around the surgical site, which is considered a normal part of the healing process. These symptoms improved gradually over time.

After discharge, the patient was advised to continue physical therapy on an outpatient basis to enhance his knee joint range of motion, strength, and functional abilities. He was prescribed a course of oral antibiotics as prophylaxis against infection and instructed on proper wound care and monitoring for signs of infection.

During follow-up visits with the orthopedic surgeon, the patient's surgical incision was found to be healing well without any signs of infection. He reported a gradual improvement in pain and functional abilities, including walking, climbing stairs, and performing household tasks. Regular radiographic evaluations were performed to assess the alignment and position of the TKR components.

In conclusion, the 65-year-old male patient successfully underwent a total knee replacement surgery for the management of severe osteoarthritis. His postoperative course was uneventful, without any major complications. The patient's pain improved, and he showed progress in his functional abilities during the postoperative period. Proper wound care, a course of antibiotics, and physical therapy were important components of his recovery process. Regular follow-up visits with the orthopedic surgeon ensured close monitoring of his surgical outcome and overall progress.
