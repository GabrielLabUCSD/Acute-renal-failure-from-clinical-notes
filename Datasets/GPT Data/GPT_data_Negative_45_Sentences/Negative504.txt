The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and controlled type 2 diabetes. He is a non-smoker and has a family history of heart disease. The patient has been scheduled for surgery due to a chronic knee injury sustained during a sporting event several years ago. He has been experiencing worsening pain, decreased mobility, and difficulty performing daily activities.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a complete medical evaluation, including blood tests, which showed well-controlled blood pressure and blood sugar levels. His lipid profile revealed mildly elevated triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Echocardiography showed normal cardiac function, and a stress test was negative for any ischemic changes. The patient has no known drug allergies, and his current medications include lisinopril for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for reducing cholesterol levels, and metformin for diabetes management.

During the preoperative consultation, the anesthesia team evaluated the patient and determined that he is fit for surgery. They discussed the procedure, potential risks, and the importance of adhering to preoperative instructions, such as fasting and medication management. Additionally, the patient was advised to stop taking atorvastatin five days before surgery to prevent potential drug interactions and adverse effects.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient's vital signs were stable throughout the procedure. The orthopedic surgeon performed a meniscectomy and cartilage debridement to alleviate the knee pain and improve the patient's mobility. The surgery was successful and without any intraoperative complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery area where he was monitored closely for any signs of pain, bleeding, or infection. Pain management was achieved using a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was encouraged to mobilize early and received physical therapy to aid in his postoperative recovery. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not require any additional intervention.

Over the next few days, the patient's knee pain gradually improved, and he experienced better mobility with the assistance of crutches. Wound healing progressed well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient was discharged home with appropriate instructions for wound care and rehabilitation exercises. He was advised to continue using crutches for support and gradually increase weight-bearing on the affected limb.

During the follow-up visit one week later, the patient reported continued improvement in knee pain and mobility. The orthopedic surgeon examined the surgical site and found no signs of infection or other complications. He recommended continued physical therapy and instructed the patient to gradually discontinue the use of crutches.

At the one-month follow-up appointment, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in knee function. He no longer required crutches and could ambulate independently. The surgical wound had healed completely, and the patient reported minimal residual pain. The orthopedic surgeon advised him to continue with physical therapy and return for a routine follow-up visit in three months to assess long-term recovery and joint stability.

In summary, the patient, a 55-year-old male, underwent a successful meniscectomy and cartilage debridement for a chronic knee injury. His postoperative course was uneventful, with good pain control and no complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or adverse reactions to anesthesia. The patient's recovery progress was satisfactory, with gradual improvement in pain, mobility, and overall knee function. The surgical team will continue to monitor his progress during follow-up visits to ensure optimal long-term outcomes.
