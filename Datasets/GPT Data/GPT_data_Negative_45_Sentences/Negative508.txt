The patient is a 60-year-old male with a significant medical history. He has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years, which is well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed with diet and oral medications. The patient is a longtime smoker, with a 40-pack-year smoking history.

The patient has been experiencing increasing chronic lower back pain over the past year. He has tried conservative management with physical therapy and over-the-counter analgesics, but his symptoms have persisted. As a result, he has decided to proceed with surgical intervention to alleviate his pain.

On preoperative evaluation, the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and his fasting glucose levels are within normal limits. His renal function is normal, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. His baseline EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a lumbar decompression and fusion surgery. The procedure is expected to be lengthy due to the extensive nature of his spinal pathology. Intraoperatively, there were no complications, and he tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for close monitoring. He remained intubated overnight but was successfully extubated the following morning. His vital signs remained stable, and he was able to maintain adequate pain control with intravenous opioids.

In the first few days after surgery, the patient experienced some postoperative pain, primarily at the surgical site. He required frequent administration of intravenous pain medications and was closely monitored for any signs of infection or bleeding. His white blood cell count remained within normal limits, and there was no evidence of surgical site infection.

Gradually, the patient's pain improved, and he was transitioned to oral pain medications. He was encouraged to ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pneumonia. The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored during this time to ensure optimal glycemic control.

On postoperative day 5, the patient was discharged home with a prescription for oral pain medications and strict activity restrictions. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for suture removal and a wound check. He was also given a referral for outpatient physical therapy to aid in his rehabilitation process.

During his follow-up appointment, there were no concerns about wound healing or signs of infection. The patient reported gradual improvement in his lower back pain and increased mobility. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable, indicating good management of his chronic medical conditions.

At the one-month follow-up visit, the patient continued to make progress with his rehabilitation. He reported minimal residual pain and was able to perform daily activities without significant limitations. His surgical incision appeared well-healed, and there were no signs of complications or infections.

In summary, the patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic smoking underwent lumbar decompression and fusion surgery. The procedure was completed without intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient experienced some pain, requiring adequate pain control and close monitoring. He was discharged home on postoperative day 5 and showed gradual improvement in pain and mobility during his follow-up visits. No complications were encountered during the postoperative course, and the patient's surgical incision healed well without signs of infection.
