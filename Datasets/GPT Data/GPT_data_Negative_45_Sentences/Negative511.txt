The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy 10 years ago and a tonsillectomy in childhood. He does not have any known drug allergies. He has never smoked and is a social drinker.

In terms of medications, the patient takes lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and simvastatin for dyslipidemia. He also takes a daily multivitamin. He reports good compliance with his medications and has had stable blood glucose and lipid levels.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with normal vital signs and no signs of infection. His height is 5'10" and his weight is 185 lbs, giving him a BMI of 26.5. He is in overall good health, other than the conditions mentioned.

Lab results reveal a normal complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and liver function tests (LFTs). His fasting blood sugar is within normal range. His lipid panel shows slightly elevated LDL cholesterol, which is expected given his dyslipidemia.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed as part of the preoperative evaluation and shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemic changes or arrhythmias. An echocardiogram is not conducted due to the patient's lack of cardiac symptoms and normal ECG findings.

The patient is well-informed about the surgical procedure, risks, and postoperative care. He has given his informed consent and understands the need for a temporary discontinuation of his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the morning of surgery.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrives in fasting state, and his blood pressure and blood glucose levels are checked upon admission. Both readings are within acceptable ranges. He undergoes general anesthesia without any complications.

During the surgery, there are no unexpected findings. The hernia repair is successful, and there is no need for additional procedures or interventions. The surgical team monitors the patient's vital signs closely throughout the procedure.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is transported to the recovery room, where his vital signs are monitored closely. He is started on intravenous fluids and given pain medication as needed. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remain stable throughout.

The patient is able to tolerate a regular diet shortly after surgery and does not experience any issues with nausea or vomiting. The surgical team encourages him to engage in deep breathing exercises and ambulation to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's pain is well-controlled with the prescribed pain medications, and he reports minimal discomfort during the first 24 hours after surgery. His wound is assessed regularly for signs of infection, but there are no concerning findings.

During the follow-up appointment, the patient's wound is healing well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels are monitored, and adjustments are made to his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications as needed.
