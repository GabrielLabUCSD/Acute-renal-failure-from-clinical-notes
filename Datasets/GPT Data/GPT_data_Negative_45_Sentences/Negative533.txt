The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is scheduled for surgery due to a chronic knee injury sustained during a fall. The patient reports having pain, swelling, and limited range of motion in his affected knee. 

His hypertension is uncontrolled, despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications including an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. His blood pressure readings have consistently been above the target range of 130/80 mmHg. The patient denies any symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. He has never experienced any cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

The patient's dyslipidemia is managed with a statin medication, and his lipid levels have been within the recommended range. He has a family history of heart disease, but he has not experienced any cardiovascular events himself. The patient denies any symptoms of angina or shortness of breath.

Regarding his diabetes, the patient has been taking metformin regularly to control his blood glucose levels. His most recent HbA1c level was 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control. He denies any symptoms of hyperglycemia such as increased thirst or frequent urination. The patient does not require insulin or other antidiabetic medications.

In terms of surgeries, the patient previously underwent a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uneventful, and he recovered well without any postoperative complications. He has not had any other surgeries or major medical interventions.

The patient's preoperative evaluation includes a comprehensive assessment of his medical conditions. His blood tests show normal renal function, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. His liver function tests and coagulation panel are also within normal limits. The patient does not have any known allergies to medications or latex.

The patient is scheduled to have knee arthroscopy to address the chronic knee injury. The surgery will involve the use of general anesthesia. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient, and he provided informed consent.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to experience pain and swelling in the operative site, which will be managed with analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications. Physical therapy will be initiated to promote range of motion and strengthen the knee joint.

Complications that could potentially arise from knee arthroscopy include infection, bleeding, blood clots, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. Measures will be taken to minimize these risks, such as administering prophylactic antibiotics and utilizing compression devices to prevent blood clots.

During the patient's postoperative course, he is expected to stay in the hospital for a day and will be closely monitored for any signs of infection or complications. Vital signs will be regularly assessed, and wound care will be implemented to prevent infection. Physical therapists will assist with mobility exercises and rehabilitation to ensure a smooth recovery.

Immediate complications such as wound infections or postoperative bleeding will be promptly addressed. If the patient presents with signs of infection such as fever, increased redness, swelling, or drainage from the incision site, cultures will be obtained, and a course of appropriate antibiotics will be initiated.

Long-term complications that can occur after knee arthroscopy include persistent pain, joint stiffness, and limited range of motion. Reinforcement of adequate pain management and adherence to physical therapy will help minimize these complications.

Lastly, the patient's postoperative course did not involve any complications.
