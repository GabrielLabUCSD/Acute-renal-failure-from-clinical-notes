The patient is a 50-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery for a hernia repair. His medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. He has been on medications such as lisinopril for blood pressure management and metformin for diabetes control. He has a history of smoking but quit two years ago. The patient reports occasional shortness of breath, which he attributes to his obesity. He denies any other significant respiratory or cardiac symptoms. He has no known drug allergies.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has undergone an appendectomy 10 years ago and a cholecystectomy 5 years ago, both without any complications. The patient was last admitted to the hospital two years ago for an elective colonoscopy, which was unremarkable. Lab results reveal a well-controlled blood sugar level with a recent HbA1c of 6.4%. Lipid profile shows a total cholesterol of 185 mg/dL and LDL of 110 mg/dL.

A preoperative chest x-ray is unremarkable, showing no signs of infection or pulmonary abnormalities. The patient's electromyography and nerve conduction study were within normal limits, excluding any peripheral neuropathy. Echocardiography results indicate mild left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved systolic function and no valvular abnormalities. He has a normal ejection fraction of 65% and an unremarkable stress test, ruling out any significant ischemic heart disease.

The patient has been educated on preoperative fasting and bowel preparation protocols. He underwent preoperative assessment by an anesthesiologist, who determined him to be an ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) Physical Status II, indicating a patient with mild systemic disease. The patient's blood pressure, glucose, and heart rate were stable during the assessment.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the operating room in a stable condition. General anesthesia was induced without any complications. The hernia repair was performed without any difficulties, and the surgical team reported no intraoperative complications. The patient's vital signs were stable throughout the procedure, and blood loss was minimal. Surgery was concluded, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room for postoperative monitoring.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient reported minimal pain at the surgical site, which was effectively managed with analgesics. He was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet without any issues. His vital signs remained stable, with no signs of infection or respiratory distress. The patient's incision site was clean, dry, and intact. He was encouraged to adhere to deep breathing exercises and mobilize in order to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient made good progress in his postoperative course, with improved pain control and gradually advancing his diet to solid food. There were no signs of wound infection, and his surgical incision healed well. His urinary output remained within normal limits, without any signs of acute kidney injury. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, were all within normal range during the hospital stay.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day three with instructions to continue his regular medications. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for about six weeks to allow for proper healing. Post-discharge, the patient remained in regular follow-up visits with his surgeon, who monitored his progress and ensured complete resolution of his surgical site.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course without any complications. He recovered well from the surgery and did not experience acute renal failure. The patient's compliance with preoperative instructions and management of comorbidities played a significant role in ensuring a successful surgical outcome.
