The patient is a 68-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history that includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. His blood pressure is well-controlled with the use of antihypertensive medications. His lipid levels are managed with lipid-lowering agents, and he maintains good glycemic control through oral hypoglycemic agents. He had a myocardial infarction six years ago, for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. He has been asymptomatic since then.

The patient has a history of smoking, with a total pack-year history of 30, but he quit smoking ten years ago. He has been counseled on the importance of maintaining smoking cessation. He denies any respiratory symptoms or a chronic cough.

In addition to his cardiac history, the patient has osteoarthritis of the bilateral knees. He experiences intermittent pain and stiffness, especially with prolonged walking. He has tried over-the-counter analgesics and physical therapy which offered temporary relief. His knee pain significantly hinders his mobility and quality of life. He has been evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon who has recommended a knee replacement surgery.

The patient's preoperative laboratory investigations show a normal complete blood count, renal function, liver function, and electrolyte levels. His coagulation profile, including prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, is within the normal range. He has a baseline hemoglobin A1c of 6.7%.

He underwent a preoperative ECG which showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave changes. An echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular systolic function without any regional wall motion abnormalities. His ejection fraction was estimated to be 60%, indicating normal cardiac function. The patient has no history of arrhythmias or heart failure symptoms.

The patient is afebrile and has no active infection at the time of surgery. His immunization status is up-to-date, including influenza and pneumonia vaccines. He does not have any known drug allergies.

During the surgical procedure, the patient was administered general anesthesia and was intubated using endotracheal intubation. Surgery went smoothly, and the patient did not experience any intraoperative complications. He received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room for any signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, or cardiovascular events. He was also closely observed for any postoperative pain or signs of respiratory distress. The patient was started on prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The patient received a patient-controlled analgesia pump to manage his postoperative pain. He also received physical therapy to promote early mobility and prevent complications associated with prolonged immobilization.

Throughout the postoperative course, the patient's vital signs remained stable. His pain was well-controlled with the use of the patient-controlled analgesia pump. He was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist on the first postoperative day.

The patient did not experience any significant postoperative complications such as wound infection, hematoma formation, or cardiovascular events. His surgical incision appeared clean and dry, without any signs of redness, warmth, or discharge.

He was discharged from the hospital on the third day post-surgery, following a satisfactory recovery. He was instructed to continue his usual medications, adhere to a diabetic diet, and monitor his blood glucose levels closely.

During the first post-discharge follow-up visit, the patient reported a significant reduction in knee pain and improved mobility. The surgical wound continued to heal without any signs of infection.

The patient underwent regular follow-up appointments with his primary care physician to monitor his blood pressure, lipid levels, and glycemic control. His antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and oral hypoglycemic medications were adjusted as needed to achieve optimal control.

During subsequent follow-up visits, the patient's knee function continued to improve, and he achieved near-normal mobility. He was encouraged to engage in regular physical activity, including joint-friendly exercises, to further enhance his knee function.

Throughout the postoperative course and subsequent follow-up visits, the patient did not experience any significant complications related to the surgery. He maintained good glycemic control with an HbA1c level of 6.8% at his last visit.

In conclusion, the patient's preoperative evaluation revealed well-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His cardiac function was normal, and he had no active infections. The patient underwent a knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, with adequate pain control, early mobility, and no signs of wound infection. The patient's recovery showed significant improvement in knee pain and mobility. No complications were reported throughout the postoperative and follow-up period, and his glycemic control remained stable.
