The patient is a 58-year-old female who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which are well-controlled with medications. She also has a history of asthma, but it is mild and well-controlled with inhalers. The patient does not smoke and has no history of recreational drug use.

Her surgical history includes an appendectomy at the age of 25 and a cholecystectomy at the age of 40. Both surgeries were uneventful, without any complications. There is no family history of any surgical complications or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient has been thoroughly evaluated prior to surgery with a comprehensive physical examination and laboratory tests. Her basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, coagulation profile, and liver function tests were all within normal limits. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which revealed no significant abnormalities. In addition, a chest X-ray was obtained, showing clear lung fields.

The patient has been advised to discontinue her antiplatelet medication, aspirin, one week before the surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding. She has been instructed to continue all other routine medications including her antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs. The anesthesiology team has reviewed her medications and has ensured there are no contraindications for anesthesia.

On the day of surgery, the patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was induced without any complications. The surgical team successfully repaired the hernia without any difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and her vital signs remained stable throughout the surgery.

Following surgery, the patient was transferred to the recovery room where she was monitored closely for any signs of postoperative complications. She was initially on oxygen supplementation but weaned off successfully within a few hours. Her pain was well-managed with intravenous and later oral medications. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

During her hospital stay, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Her vital signs remained stable, and she had no signs of wound infection or dehiscence. She was able to tolerate a regular diet without any difficulty. Postoperative blood work, including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, remained within normal limits. The surgical site was observed daily by the healthcare team and showed appropriate signs of healing.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three with a prescription for pain medication and instructions for wound care. She was advised to avoid any strenuous physical activities for the first few weeks post-surgery. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in two weeks to ensure proper healing and to remove any sutures if necessary.

In summary, the patient's medical history includes controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mild asthma. She has a previous surgical history, with uneventful appendectomy and cholecystectomy. Her preoperative evaluation suggests that she is in overall good health and a suitable candidate for the scheduled hernia repair surgery. The surgery itself went smoothly without any complications, and the patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. She was discharged home with appropriate instructions and is expected to have a full recovery without any complications.
