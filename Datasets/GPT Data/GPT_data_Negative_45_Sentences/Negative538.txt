The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a herniated disc in the lumbar region. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure has been well controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, and his lipid levels have improved with atorvastatin. His diabetes is managed with metformin and diet modifications.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of tobacco use, smoking half a pack per day for the past 30 years. He has expressed interest in quitting smoking and has been provided with resources for smoking cessation.

The patient's surgical candidacy was evaluated by the anesthesia team, who reviewed his preoperative labs and deemed him fit for surgery. His preoperative labs revealed a well-controlled fasting blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL, HbA1c of 6.5%, and lipid panel within normal limits. His renal function, as measured by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was normal.

The patient was counseled on preoperative fasting requirements and medication management. He was advised to withhold his antihypertensive medication on the day of surgery and to resume it once able to take oral medications postoperatively. He was also instructed to continue taking his oral hypoglycemic medication unless instructed otherwise by the surgical team.

The patient underwent the surgery without any immediate complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, with adequate pain control managed with a combination of oral analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia. He was closely monitored for any signs of infection or wound complications but none were noted.

As part of routine postoperative care, the patient was mobilized early, with physical therapy guiding him through a graduated exercise program to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. He was also instructed to maintain proper wound hygiene and to report any signs of infection, such as redness, warmth, or purulent discharge.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay, and his pain was well controlled. He was able to tolerate a regular diet soon after surgery without any gastrointestinal issues.

In terms of smoking cessation, the patient reported making efforts to quit before surgery but admitted occasional lapses. He was referred to a smoking cessation program to receive counseling and pharmacotherapy to support his long-term smoking cessation goals.

The patient's recommended postoperative follow-up consists of regular visits with the surgical and anesthesia team to monitor his recovery and manage any potential complications. He was also advised to continue his usual antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications. Additionally, he should receive regular check-ups to monitor his blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid profiles.

To summarize, the patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, is planning to undergo surgery for a herniated disc. His preoperative labs, including fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and renal function, were within normal limits. The surgery was performed without complications, and his postoperative course has been unremarkable. He continues to receive proper pain management, wound care, and mobilization. Efforts for smoking cessation are ongoing, with resources being provided for support. Regular follow-up visits are planned to monitor his recovery and manage his chronic conditions.
