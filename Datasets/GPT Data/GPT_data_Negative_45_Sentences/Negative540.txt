The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a significant medical history and is planning to undergo surgery in the near future. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently managed on medications including lisinopril for blood pressure control, metformin for diabetes treatment, and atorvastatin for cholesterol management.

The patient had a previous myocardial infarction eight years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting. Since then, he has been asymptomatic for angina and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. He has regular follow-up with his cardiologist every six months and his stress test done a year ago showed no signs of ischemia.

In addition to his cardiovascular conditions, the patient also has a history of osteoarthritis of the right knee, which has been causing him significant pain and functional limitations. Conservative management with physical therapy and analgesics has been ineffective, and therefore, the patient has elected to undergo a total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's preoperative workup included a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram. The lab results were within normal limits, and his electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without any acute changes.

During his preoperative evaluation, the patient was found to have a body mass index of 32, which classifies him as obese. He was counseled on the potential risks associated with surgery in the presence of obesity and advised to engage in weight loss measures to optimize his surgical outcome.

The patient has been provided with instructions regarding medication management before and after surgery. He has been advised to continue his lisinopril and metformin on the morning of surgery with a small sip of water. His anticoagulation regimen was modified, and he was asked to discontinue clopidogrel for five days prior to surgery while continuing aspirin.

On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The surgery proceeded without any complications, and a total knee replacement was successfully performed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and wound care. He received a multimodal pain management regimen including opioid and non-opioid analgesics, as well as regional analgesia with an epidural catheter. His wound was inspected daily for signs of infection or dehiscence.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced significant swelling and pain around the surgical site, which gradually improved over the next few days with appropriate interventions. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to facilitate early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

During his hospital stay, the patient's blood glucose levels were well-controlled with sliding-scale insulin as needed. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not develop any signs of infection or wound complications. He received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and was monitored for any signs of bleeding due to his anticoagulation therapy.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was able to ambulate independently and was discharged home with a prescription for physical therapy. He was provided with instructions for wound care and advised to continue his anticoagulation regimen with aspirin. Additionally, he was referred for outpatient follow-up with both his orthopedic surgeon and cardiologist.

Overall, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course following his total knee replacement surgery. He experienced the expected postoperative pain and swelling, which improved over time with appropriate management. No complications such as infection, wound dehiscence, or bleeding were encountered. The patient was satisfied with the surgery and noted improved functionality of his knee during his follow-up visits.
