The patient is a 63-year-old male who has been experiencing chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis for the past five years. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy, pain medications, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, but his symptoms have not improved significantly. Therefore, he has recently decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient was found to have a history of hypertension, which is well controlled with medication. He has a smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit smoking five years ago. He denies any significant cardiac or pulmonary conditions and has a normal body mass index.

His laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. His blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were also stable during the evaluation. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

The patient was seen by an anesthesiologist and deemed suitable for general anesthesia. Given his overall good health and the absence of any contraindications, the surgical team anticipates a successful outcome.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the day before surgery and received preoperative instructions regarding fasting, medication management, and postoperative care. On the morning of the surgery, his vital signs were stable, and he was taken to the operating room.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and a total knee replacement was successfully completed without any intraoperative concerns or complications. The patient was closely monitored for blood loss, oxygenation, and fluid management throughout the procedure.

Following surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. His vital signs remained stable, and he was able to maintain adequate pain control through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous opioids. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to encourage early mobilization and promote joint range of motion.

His initial postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of surgical site infection or deep vein thrombosis. He was closely monitored for signs of complications such as wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, or respiratory distress. Serial laboratory investigations were performed to assess his hemoglobin levels, coagulation profile, and renal function.

The patient demonstrated good progress in physical therapy, gradually increasing his weight-bearing activities and achieving satisfactory flexion and extension of the affected knee joint. He remained motivated and engaged in the rehabilitation process.

On the third postoperative day, the patient developed a low-grade fever accompanied by mild leukocytosis. Blood cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated empirically to cover potential infections. His fever resolved within 48 hours, and blood cultures did not grow any organisms, suggesting a self-limited inflammatory response.

After careful evaluation, the fever was attributed to the surgical stress and inflammatory reaction rather than a specific infection. The patient was monitored closely, and there were no further complications.

Given his stable progress and satisfactory knee joint function, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day. He was provided detailed instructions regarding wound care, pain management, physical therapy exercises, and the importance of follow-up appointments.

During the follow-up visits, the patient continued to demonstrate improvement in knee function and mobility. He reported minimal residual pain, which was managed with over-the-counter analgesics. The surgical incision had healed well without any signs of infection, and range of motion of the knee joint was within the expected parameters for the postoperative period.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course following total knee replacement surgery was favorable, with only a transient febrile episode that resolved without the need for specific interventions. The surgery successfully relieved his chronic knee pain, allowing him to resume his regular activities with an improved quality of life.
