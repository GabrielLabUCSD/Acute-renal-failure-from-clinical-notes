Patient Summary:

The patient is preparing to undergo surgery and has an extensive medical history. The individual is a 55-year-old male with a BMI of 32, diagnosed as obese. They have a past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea. The patient has been on medication regimens for all comorbidities, including metoprolol for hypertension, atorvastatin for dyslipidemia, and metformin for diabetes. They also utilize a CPAP machine for sleep apnea.

The patient's surgical procedure involves a total hip replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. On examination, it was observed that the patient has difficulty walking, with limited range of motion and constant pain in the right hip. Prior to surgery, the patient consulted with an orthopedic surgeon, who discussed the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives. They reviewed the patient's medical history and conducted a preoperative evaluation.

In terms of preoperative interventions, the patient underwent various tests, including laboratory investigations of blood count, complete metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and kidney function. Within normal limits, the patient had a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel consistent with diabetes and dyslipidemia control. The coagulation profile revealed no abnormalities. Their kidney function tests indicated a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 70 ml/min/1.73 mÂ², which was considered adequate for surgery.

Regarding the anesthesia plan, the patient met with an anesthesiologist who conducted a preoperative assessment, including a detailed history review and physical examination. Since the patient had a posterior approach hip replacement scheduled, a neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anesthetic technique was chosen as it provides optimal pain control postoperatively.

The surgery took place under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. The patient was monitored appropriately throughout the procedure, with stable vital signs. Following surgery, the individual was transferred to the recovery room for close observation. Pain management was initiated, focusing on controlling postoperative hip pain with a combination of analgesics and physical therapy.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. The orthopedic surgeon advised early mobilization, and the patient was able to ambulate under the guidance of a physical therapist. Postoperative pain was effectively managed, with a gradual tapering of analgesic medications.

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any acute renal failure. However, they did encounter a mild surgical site infection, which was treated with antibiotics and proper wound care. The infection resolved without further complications, and the patient was discharged five days post-surgery after demonstrating stable vital signs and independent ambulation.

During the scheduled follow-up appointments, the patient exhibited overall improvement in mobility and reduction in pain. They were referred to physical therapy for continued rehabilitation. The patient's medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were adjusted as per postoperative requirements.

In summary, the patient, with multiple comorbidities including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, underwent a total hip replacement for severe osteoarthritis. The surgical procedure and anesthesia administration were successful without any immediate complications. The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful, except for a mild surgical site infection that resolved with appropriate treatment. The patient showed improvement in pain control and mobility and was discharged in stable condition. Follow-up care focused on continuing rehabilitation and adjusting medications as needed.
