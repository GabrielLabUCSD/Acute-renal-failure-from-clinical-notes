The patient's oxygen saturation remained within normal limits, and there were no signs of respiratory distress.

Once the patient achieved adequate pain control and met the PACU discharge criteria, they were transferred to a general medical/surgical unit for continued postoperative care. Vital signs were monitored regularly, and intravenous fluids and medications were administered as ordered.
