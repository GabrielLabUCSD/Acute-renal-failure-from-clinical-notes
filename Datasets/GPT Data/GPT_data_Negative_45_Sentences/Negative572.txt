In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was monitored in the recovery room for initial recovery and stabilization. Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, were closely monitored. The patient was also assessed for pain control and provided appropriate analgesics.

In the following days after surgery, the patient had a smooth postoperative course without any major complications. They were monitored for signs of infection, especially at the surgical site, and received prophylactic antibiotics as per the surgical protocol. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and venous thromboembolism.

A few days after the surgery, the patient was discharged home with detailed discharge instructions and medications for pain management. They were advised to continue taking their regular medications and to follow up with their surgeon for a postoperative evaluation.

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reported no concerning symptoms or complications. Their surgical incision site appeared to be healing well without signs of infection. The patient's pain was well-controlled with the prescribed analgesics, and they were able to resume their daily activities gradually.

In summary, the patient has a complex medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, CAD, and GERD.
