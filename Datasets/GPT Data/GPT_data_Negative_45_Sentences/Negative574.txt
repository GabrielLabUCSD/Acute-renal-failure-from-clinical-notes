The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently taking medication for these conditions and his blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels are well-controlled. He also has a past medical history of osteoarthritis in his knees, which causes him intermittent pain but does not require any specific treatment.
The patient is scheduled to have surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee. This injury was sustained during a fall while playing basketball. The patient has been experiencing pain, swelling, and limited mobility in his knee since the injury occurred two months ago. Conservative management with physical therapy did not provide adequate relief, leading to the decision to proceed with surgical intervention.
Prior to the surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, which included a complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, and an electrocardiogram. All test results were within normal limits, and the patient was deemed fit for surgery. The anesthesiologist also performed a detailed assessment of the patient's airway and confirmed that he is a suitable candidate for general anesthesia.
On the day of the surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital fasting as instructed. He was admitted to the surgical unit and prepared for the procedure. Prior to induction of anesthesia, the surgical site was cleaned and draped, ensuring proper aseptic technique. The anesthesiologist administered anesthesia, and the surgical team successfully repaired the torn meniscus using minimally invasive arthroscopic techniques. The surgery lasted approximately one hour, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
During the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, were stable. The patient received adequate pain control through a combination of intravenous and oral analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated on the same day of the surgery to enhance early mobilization and prevent complications associated with immobility.
Following the surgery, the patient's knee demonstrated gradual improvement. He experienced mild pain and swelling, which were managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ice packs. The patient diligently followed the prescribed physical therapy regimen and experienced progressive improvement in knee range of motion and strength. He was able to bear weight on the affected leg without significant discomfort.
Postoperative follow-up appointments were scheduled at one week, three weeks, and six weeks after the surgery. During these visits, the orthopedic surgeon assessed the patient's progress, evaluated the healing process, and monitored for any signs of infection or other complications. The patient's incision site healed well without any signs of redness, swelling, or discharge. The knee remained stable, and no mechanical symptoms were reported.
Overall, the patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, with steady improvement in pain and function. He did not experience any major complications such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, or wound dehiscence. The patient's adherence to the prescribed rehabilitation program greatly contributed to his successful recovery.
In conclusion, the patient had a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee after failed conservative management. The surgery was successful, and the patient's immediate postoperative period was uneventful. He experienced mild pain and swelling, which improved with the use of analgesics and ice packs. The patient actively participated in physical therapy and demonstrated consistent progress in knee range of motion and strength. Postoperative follow-up appointments revealed satisfactory healing and no signs of infection or other complications. The patient's recovery was deemed successful without any major postoperative complications.
