The patient is a 65-year-old male, who is planning to have surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father having had a heart attack in his 60s.

The patient's medications include metoprolol for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for cholesterol management, and metformin for diabetes control. He is compliant with his medications and has been on a stable dose for the past year. His blood pressure has been well-controlled with a consistent average of 130/80 mmHg, and his HbA1c levels have been consistently around 7%, indicating fair glycemic control.

His surgical history is significant for an appendectomy performed 10 years ago, with no complications or postoperative infections reported. He underwent an upper endoscopy 3 years ago for evaluation of dyspeptic symptoms, which revealed mild gastritis. The patient has no known drug allergies.

On physical examination, the patient is well-nourished and in no acute distress. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The cardiac examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with no palpable masses. There is a reducible right inguinal hernia appreciated on examination.

Laboratory results show a normal complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. His hemoglobin A1c is 7%, and his fasting blood glucose is 130 mg/dL, indicating fair glycemic control. An electrocardiogram is performed, which reveals normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of ischemic changes.

In preparation for surgery, the patient undergoes a preoperative assessment by an anesthesiologist to evaluate his fitness for surgery. He is deemed to be at an average risk for anesthesia and is cleared for surgery. He is instructed to discontinue his metformin 48 hours prior to the procedure but continues taking his other medications as usual.

The patient undergoes an uneventful inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia. The surgery lasts approximately 45 minutes, and the patient tolerates the procedure well. He receives prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively to prevent surgical site infections.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is monitored closely in the recovery room. His vital signs remain stable, and he recovers well from anesthesia without any complications. He is started on a clear liquid diet and encouraged to ambulate as tolerated.

The patient is discharged home on the same day of the surgery with appropriate postoperative instructions. He is advised to take over-the-counter pain medications as needed for mild discomfort at the incision site. He is also advised to avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting for the next 4 weeks. The wound is inspected, and there are no signs of infection or wound breakdown.

During the follow-up visit 1 week later, the patient reports minimal pain and a well-healed incision. The incision site is clean, dry, and without any signs of infection. The patient is instructed to gradually resume normal activities and return to work as tolerated. He is advised to continue his regular medications, including metformin, and to follow up in 4 weeks for a routine visit.

In the subsequent follow-up visit, the patient reports no complications and is fully recovered from the surgery. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remain well controlled, and his hemoglobin A1c level remains stable at 7%. The patient is advised to continue his current medications and to follow up annually for routine check-ups.

Thus, the patient's postoperative course following inguinal hernia repair was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications.
