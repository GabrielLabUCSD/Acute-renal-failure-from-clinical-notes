The patient is a middle-aged individual who is planning to undergo surgery. Their medical history includes several chronic conditions that need to be considered during the preoperative assessment. The patient has a history of hypertension, which has been controlled with medication for the past five years. They also have type 2 diabetes and have been on oral medications for glycemic control.

In addition to these conditions, the patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which they are taking statin medication. They have had two episodes of chest pain in the past, both of which were attributed to non-cardiac causes. The patient does not have a history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease.

The patient has been a long-term smoker, consuming a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. They have attempted to quit smoking multiple times but have been unsuccessful so far. They do not have any symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and have not required any hospitalizations related to their smoking history.

Regarding their surgical history, the patient has previously undergone an appendectomy at the age of 20 without any complications. They have never had any major surgeries since then. The patient does not have a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable. Their blood pressure is well-controlled, with readings consistently below 130/80 mmHg. The patient's height and weight are within normal ranges, and their body mass index is noted to be 25 kg/m2.

Laboratory investigations reveal well-controlled blood glucose levels, with recent hemoglobin A1c levels below 7%. Lipid profile results are within target ranges, indicating effective management of hyperlipidemia with statin therapy. Other routine blood tests, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient has been thoroughly educated about the upcoming surgery, including the potential risks and benefits. They have been advised to discontinue smoking at least two weeks before surgery to reduce perioperative complications. The patient has expressed their willingness to quit smoking and has scheduled a session with a smoking cessation counselor.

The surgical procedure planned for the patient is an elective cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The surgical team has determined that the patient is fit for surgery and will provide optimized perioperative care.

Following the cholecystectomy, the patient's postoperative course is uneventful. They are closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit and then transferred to the surgical ward. Pain is well-controlled with intravenous analgesics initially, then transitioning to oral pain medication as tolerated.

The patient is encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis. They are also started on prophylactic subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism.

The patient resumes a regular diet the day after surgery and experiences no postoperative nausea or vomiting. Their bowel function returns two days after surgery, and they pass gas without any issues. The surgical wound is clean, dry, and without any signs of infection.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient is discharged home with oral pain medication for symptomatic relief. They are advised to take it easy for the next few weeks, gradually resuming their normal activities. Postoperative follow-up is scheduled in two weeks to assess wound healing and address any concerns.

Throughout the postoperative course, the patient does not develop any complications, such as wound infection, dehiscence, or surgical site bleeding. They do not experience any respiratory complications, such as atelectasis or pneumonia, indicating good postoperative lung function.

Although the patient's surgical course is uneventful, it should be noted that the risk of complications can vary depending on the type and invasiveness of the surgery. Therefore, this summary does not include all possible surgical procedures or their associated complications. Additionally, acute renal failure is excluded as a complication, as specified in the prompt.
