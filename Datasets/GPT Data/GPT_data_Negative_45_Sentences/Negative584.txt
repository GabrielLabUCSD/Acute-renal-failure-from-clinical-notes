The patient in question is a 58-year-old male, with a previous medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He presents with symptoms of severe osteoarthritis in both knees, leading to impaired mobility and chronic pain. After evaluation by an orthopedic specialist, it was determined that bilateral knee replacement surgery would be the best course of treatment to alleviate the patient's symptoms and improve his quality of life.

During the preoperative period, the patient underwent various preoperative tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). The results of these tests showed no significant abnormalities. The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were adequately controlled within normal ranges. Additionally, a chest X-ray and an echocardiogram were performed, revealing no signs of cardiopulmonary dysfunction that could impede surgery.

The patient was advised to stop taking anticoagulant medications and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) one week before the surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding. He was instructed to continue taking his regular medications, including antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications, with a sip of water on the morning of the surgery. The patient was also provided with information about the surgical procedure, preoperative fasting, postoperative care, and potential complications.

Bilateral total knee arthroplasty was performed under general anesthesia, without any intraoperative complications. The surgical procedure involved the removal of the damaged joint surfaces and their replacement with artificial implants. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring and recovery.

The patient's postoperative course was closely monitored, with vital signs, pain levels, and incision site assessments performed regularly. He was provided with intravenous pain medication initially and later switched to oral pain medications as his pain decreased. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to facilitate early mobilization and enhance muscle strength and joint flexibility.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and coagulation parameters were closely monitored and maintained within normal ranges. Wound care was performed regularly, observing proper aseptic technique to prevent any surgical site infections. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and coughing techniques to prevent respiratory complications, such as pneumonia.

The patient's recovery progressed as expected, with gradual improvement in pain control and mobility. He received extensive patient education regarding the use of assistive devices, such as crutches or a walker, to aid in ambulation during the early stages of rehabilitation. The physical therapy sessions were gradually intensified to regain full range of motion and strength in the knee joints.

In terms of complications, the patient had an unremarkable postoperative course overall. He did not experience any wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, deep joint infection, or excessive bleeding. His pain was adequately managed throughout the process, and he actively participated in physical therapy without any setbacks. The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were consistently stable, and no cardiac or pulmonary complications were observed.

The patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day, with appropriate home instructions including wound care, pain management, dietary guidelines, and the importance of continuing with prescribed medications. Follow-up appointments were scheduled for monitoring and evaluating the progress of his recovery.

In summary, this 58-year-old male underwent bilateral knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. The surgery was performed without complications, and the patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. Adequate pain management, physical therapy, and patient education were provided, resulting in gradual improvement in pain control and mobility. The patient's blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and coagulation parameters remained within normal ranges throughout his hospital stay. No postoperative complications such as wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, or excessive bleeding were observed. The patient was discharged home with scheduled follow-up appointments to monitor his recovery.
