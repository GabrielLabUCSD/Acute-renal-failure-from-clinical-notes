The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who is planning to undergo surgery. He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years and his blood pressure has been well controlled. He has been taking metformin for his diabetes, and his blood glucose levels have been fairly stable.

The patient has a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. However, the patient himself has never experienced any cardiac symptoms and has a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram.

Additionally, he has a history of osteoarthritis primarily affecting his knees and hips. He has been managing this condition with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed and has not required any surgical interventions for his joints.

He has a smoking history of 20 pack-years but quit smoking 10 years ago. His lung function tests have shown no evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or any other significant respiratory impairment.

The patient has had no previous surgeries and has no known allergies to any medications. His preoperative laboratory results are unremarkable, with hemoglobin levels within the normal range, normal kidney function, and a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL.

The surgical procedure planned for the patient is a right total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis causing significant pain and functional limitations.

During the postoperative course, the patient experienced moderate pain immediately after the surgery, which was adequately managed with intravenous opioids. He was placed on a prophylactic regimen of low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

His vital signs remained stable, and he had no signs of cardiovascular instability or complications related to his hypertension. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and adjustments to his diabetes medications were made to ensure good glycemic control.

The patient was encouraged to participate in physical therapy to optimize his recovery and regain strength and mobility in the operated knee. He was prescribed analgesics for pain management, and a multimodal approach was used to minimize opioid use.

There were no signs of wound infection or dehiscence, and his surgical incision healed well. Postoperative radiographs showed appropriate placement of the prosthetic knee joint, with no evidence of any malpositioning or complications related to the surgery.

The patient's recovery was uneventful except for a transient episode of postoperative delirium, which resolved with supportive care and a reduction in the dose of opioids.

He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4, and arrangements were made for home physical therapy to continue his rehabilitation.

During the subsequent follow-up visits, the patient showed steady progress in terms of pain control, range of motion, and overall functional improvement. He was able to walk with the aid of a walker and gradually transitioned to using a cane.

At the 6-week postoperative visit, the patient reported that his pain was significantly improved compared to preoperatively, and his knee mobility had greatly improved. A repeat X-ray confirmed proper positioning of the prosthetic knee and no signs of implant loosening or other complications.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, with appropriate pain management, wound healing, and functional recovery. He did not develop any major complications, such as infection, wound healing issues, cardiovascular events, or respiratory complications.

The patient was advised to continue his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications as before, and regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor his blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and overall recovery.

In summary, this 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and osteoarthritis underwent a right total knee replacement for severe osteoarthritis. His postoperative course was unremarkable, with adequate pain control, no complications, and steady functional improvement. Ongoing rehabilitation and follow-up visits are planned to ensure continued recovery and monitor any potential long-term complications.
