The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. His past medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been taking medications for these conditions, including metoprolol for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had undergone a cholecystectomy 10 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. The surgery was uneventful, and there were no postoperative complications. The patient also reported a family history of heart disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 62.

Preoperatively, the patient was evaluated by the anesthesiologist and found to be in overall good health. Laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, were all within normal limits. The patient's fasting blood glucose levels were also well-controlled with his current medication regimen.

Regarding the surgical procedure, the patient's hernia repair was performed under general anesthesia. The surgery went smoothly, and there were no immediate complications. The patient was transferred to the recovery room postoperatively, where he was closely monitored for any signs of anesthesia-related complications, such as respiratory depression or hypotension. The patient woke up from anesthesia without any issues and did not experience any postoperative nausea or vomiting.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was kept on a clear liquid diet and was instructed to ambulate as tolerated. He was started on acetaminophen for pain management and was closely monitored for any signs of wound infection or dehiscence. The patient received proper wound care, ensuring that the surgical site remained clean and dry.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the second day after the surgery. The patient was provided with clear instructions regarding wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions, along with a follow-up appointment with his surgeon in one week.

During the follow-up visit, the surgeon examined the surgical site and found no signs of infection or wound complications. The patient reported minimal pain at the incision site, which was expected and managed well with acetaminophen. The surgeon advised the patient to gradually increase his activity level over the next few weeks and follow a balanced diet to promote proper healing.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery for hernia repair without any significant perioperative complications. He followed the postoperative instructions carefully and experienced a smooth recovery. No mention of acute renal failure or any other complications were reported.
