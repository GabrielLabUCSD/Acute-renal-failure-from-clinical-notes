The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure has been well controlled on lisinopril, and he is on atorvastatin for his high cholesterol levels and metformin for his diabetes.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed five years ago for symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uneventful, and he had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He has no known drug allergies and has never had any adverse reactions to anesthesia.

His social history reveals a 20-pack-year smoking history, but he quit smoking two years ago. He does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He is married and lives with his wife and two adult children.

The patient's preoperative evaluation indicates his overall health is stable. His physical examination shows clear breath sounds on auscultation and a regular heartbeat without any murmurs. His abdomen is soft and nontender, with no signs of herniation.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.8%, indicating fair glycemic control in his diabetes. His fasting lipid profile shows total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 110 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 50 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 120 mg/dL.

An electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm without any acute changes. His chest X-ray is unremarkable, showing no evidence of cardiomegaly or infiltrates. Additionally, his pulmonary function tests reveal a normal forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).

Given his stable medical history and good physical condition, the patient is deemed suitable for surgery with a low perioperative risk. He is provided with preoperative instructions, including fasting guidelines and medication management.

The patient undergoes an uneventful surgery, during which the hernia repair is performed laparoscopically. The procedure involves reducing the hernia contents, repairing the fascial defect, and securing the mesh. The operation lasts approximately one hour, and he receives general anesthesia.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is monitored closely for signs of pain, infection, or complications. He is administered intravenous fluids and analgesics for pain control. His vital signs remain stable, and he shows no signs of postoperative bleeding, wound dehiscence, or infection.

The patient is ambulating within a few hours after surgery, and his urinary output is within normal limits. He maintains good oral intake and tolerates a regular diet without any gastrointestinal issues. Bowel function returns on the second day with normal passage of flatus and stool.

There are no signs of surgical site infection, and the wound is healing well. His pain is adequately controlled with oral analgesics, and he is transitioned to oral medications after 48 hours. The patient is instructed on proper wound care and advised to continue taking his regular medications as prescribed.

During the postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reports minimal pain and discomfort. The wound is clean, dry, and intact. No signs of erythema, swelling, or discharge are observed. His respiratory function remains normal, with no signs of pneumonia or atelectasis.

The patient's glycemic control remains stable, with blood glucose levels within target range. There are no significant changes in his lipid profile postoperatively, demonstrating adequate lipid management. Blood pressure remains well controlled without any fluctuations.

Approximately one week after surgery, the patient is seen for a routine follow-up visit. He reports feeling fully recovered and has resumed his daily activities. The abdominal wound has healed completely, and there are no signs of hernia recurrence.

As for complications, the patient does not experience any unforeseen adverse events during the perioperative period or postoperative course. Acute renal failure is not observed. His surgical outcome is considered successful, and he is advised to continue leading a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet. Follow-up appointments are scheduled as needed.
