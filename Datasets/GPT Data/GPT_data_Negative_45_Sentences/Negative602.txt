The patient is a 62-year-old female who presented with symptoms of severe knee pain and limited mobility. She has a history of osteoarthritis and has been managing her symptoms with conservative measures, including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, her symptoms have progressively worsened over the past six months, impacting her quality of life.

The patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies. Her blood work revealed normal kidney and liver function, as well as an unremarkable complete blood count. Imaging studies, including X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging, confirmed the presence of advanced osteoarthritis in her right knee joint.

Considering her symptoms and failed conservative management, the patient and her orthopedic surgeon opted for a total knee replacement surgery. The patient was educated about the procedure, including potential risks and benefits, as well as the expected postoperative course and rehabilitation.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Intraoperatively, the surgeon encountered severe joint degeneration and made appropriate adjustments to ensure a proper fit of the prosthesis.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for any immediate complications. She received appropriate pain management, including a combination of opioids and non-opioid analgesics, to ensure adequate pain control. Physical therapy was initiated on the same day of surgery, focusing on range of motion exercises and assisted ambulation.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient was closely monitored for signs of infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She received prophylactic antibiotics and subcutaneous anticoagulation therapy to minimize the risk of complications. Her vital signs remained stable, and she did not exhibit any signs of postoperative bleeding or wound complications.

On the second postoperative day, the patient successfully ambulated with the assistance of a walker and reported reduced pain compared to preoperatively. She was discharged home with a prescription for oral pain medication and clear instructions on wound care and activity restrictions. The patient was scheduled for close outpatient follow-up to monitor her progress and adjust her pain management regimen as needed.

In the weeks following surgery, the patient diligently attended outpatient physical therapy sessions, gradually improving her knee range of motion and strength. She consistently reported reduced pain levels, allowing her to gradually increase her daily activities and perform household tasks independently.

The patient did not experience any complications during her postoperative course. Her surgical wound healed well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. She did not develop any signs of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and her renal function remained within normal limits.

At the six-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported significant improvement in her knee pain, range of motion, and day-to-day functioning. The orthopedic surgeon was pleased with her progress and recommended continuing with physical therapy and gradually returning to her regular activities.

In conclusion, a 62-year-old female patient with severe knee osteoarthritis underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery. Her postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications observed. The patient demonstrated significant improvement in pain and function, allowing her to regain independence and resume her daily activities.
