The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes, both of which are well-controlled with medications. He had a myocardial infarction four years ago and underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery without any complications. The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and requires two puffs of an albuterol inhaler twice daily for symptom control.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone cholecystectomy and appendectomy, both of which were uneventful. He has no known allergies to medications or any other surgical complications. The patient reports a family history of colorectal cancer, with one first-degree relative being diagnosed at the age of 55.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and in overall good health. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals regular rate and rhythm, and lung examination shows decreased breath sounds in the bases bilaterally with mild expiratory wheezing. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no tenderness, distension, or masses palpated.

Laboratory results show a normal complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. The patient's hemoglobin A1c is 6.5%, indicating well-controlled diabetes. Chest X-ray demonstrates hyperinflation consistent with COPD without any acute findings. EKG reveals normal sinus rhythm and no signs of ischemia or infarction.

Given the patient's family history of colorectal cancer and to rule out any malignancies, a colonoscopy is scheduled as part of the preoperative evaluation. The results are pending at this time.

The patient is informed about the risks and benefits of the upcoming surgery, and all of his questions are addressed to his satisfaction. The procedure is explained to him in detail, and he gives informed consent. He is advised to discontinue anticoagulant medication one week prior to surgery per surgeon's recommendation.

Following surgery, the patient's postoperative course is smooth. He is monitored frequently for vital signs and pain management. His incision site is well-approximated and shows no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient is started on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day 1 and gradually advances to a regular diet as tolerated. Hydration and electrolyte levels are monitored closely, and the patient is encouraged to ambulate to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's pain is well-controlled with oral analgesics, and his pulmonary function remains stable without signs of exacerbation of COPD. He receives respiratory treatments as needed, and no supplemental oxygen is required. The patient is able to participate in pulmonary toilet exercises and uses his albuterol inhaler as prescribed.

In terms of his postoperative recovery, the patient is followed up closely by the surgical team. He is discharged home on postoperative day 4 in stable condition with appropriate pain medications and instructions for wound care. The patient is advised to schedule a follow-up appointment for suture removal and pathology report review.

Fortunately, the patient experiences no immediate complications following surgery. He does not develop surgical site infection, pneumonia, or deep vein thrombosis. However, regular follow-up visits are recommended to monitor his postoperative progress and follow any further management plans, especially in relation to the pending colonoscopy results for possible malignancy.
