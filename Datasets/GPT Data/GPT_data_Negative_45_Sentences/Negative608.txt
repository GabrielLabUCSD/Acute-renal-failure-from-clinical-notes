The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia. He has been well-controlled on his current medications which include metoprolol, metformin, and atorvastatin. His blood pressure is typically around 130/80 mmHg and his blood glucose levels are well-managed with an HbA1c of 6.5%. His cholesterol levels are within normal limits.

The patient is now planning to have surgery for a right inguinal hernia repair. He has been experiencing pain and discomfort in his groin area for the past month, and upon examination, a hernia has been identified. The patient has opted for surgical intervention to alleviate his symptoms and reduce the risk of potential complications such as strangulation or bowel obstruction.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a preoperative assessment which included a review of his medical history, a physical examination, and routine laboratory tests. His laboratory results showed normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, ruling out any signs of acute renal failure.

The patient's surgical procedure is scheduled under general anesthesia, and he has been advised on the necessary preoperative instructions such as fasting for a specific duration. The surgeon has explained the risks and benefits of the procedure, and the patient consented to the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored for any signs of complications such as infection, bleeding, or adverse reactions to anesthesia. He received appropriate analgesics to manage his postoperative pain and was encouraged to ambulate to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.

The patient tolerated the surgery well and experienced an uneventful recovery. Postoperative follow-up visits were scheduled for wound checks and to assess for any signs of recurrence. He reported minimal pain and no signs of infection. In the absence of complications, the patient was gradually weaned off analgesics as his pain decreased.

The patient's surgical wound showed good healing progress with minimal swelling and redness. No signs of infection, such as discharge or erythema, were observed. The surgeon advised the patient to avoid strenuous physical activities for a few weeks to promote optimal healing.

Throughout the postoperative course, the patient's blood pressure remained stable with readings around 130/80 mmHg. His blood glucose levels were well-controlled, with an HbA1c of 6.3%.

The patient did not experience any complications following the surgery, ensuring a smooth recovery. Routine laboratory tests performed during the postoperative period showed no abnormalities. 

The patient was referred for physical therapy to aid in the recovery of muscle tone and strength in the surgical site, and to reduce the risk of future hernias. He was provided with adequate postoperative instructions to facilitate his recovery at home, including wound care, pain management, and when to seek medical assistance if needed.

In summary, this 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia underwent surgery for a right inguinal hernia repair. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia without complications. Postoperatively, the patient experienced a smooth recovery with minimal pain and no signs of infection. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained well-controlled. The patient was referred for physical therapy to aid in his recovery and was provided with appropriate postoperative instructions.
