Patient XYZ is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes who is planning to have surgery. He was admitted to the hospital for evaluation and preparation for the surgical procedure. His blood pressure has been well controlled on Lisinopril 10 mg daily and his diabetes is managed with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily.

The patient reports occasional chest pain with exertion, which has been stable and well-controlled with nitroglycerin. He had a myocardial infarction six years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending artery.

His surgical history includes an appendectomy performed during childhood and a cholecystectomy five years ago. Both surgeries were uneventful, and the patient recovered without complications.

Upon examination, the patient appears well nourished and in no apparent distress. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Laboratory tests conducted during preoperative evaluations show normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ². His liver function tests and coagulation profile are within normal limits.

Chest X-ray shows no active pulmonary infiltrates or signs of congestive heart failure. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of acute ischemic changes or arrhythmias.

In terms of allergies, the patient has a known allergy to penicillin which manifests as a rash, but there are no other reported drug allergies.

During the anesthesia consultation, it was determined that the patient is at an average risk for anesthesia-related complications. His airway examination is unremarkable with a Mallampati score of I.

The patient's surgical procedure is scheduled to be performed under general anesthesia. The estimated duration of the surgery is approximately three hours.

Postoperatively, the patient initially recovers without complications. He is monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for any signs of pain, bleeding, or airway compromise.

The patient is started on empiric antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. He is also maintained on his home medications, including Lisinopril and Metformin, unless otherwise contraindicated.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is encouraged to ambulate and deep breathing exercises are initiated to prevent pulmonary complications.

The patient's pain is adequately controlled with intravenous opioids in the early postoperative period, and he is transitioned to oral pain medications as tolerated.

On day one following surgery, the patient continues to recover well, with stable vital signs and no signs of wound infection or dehiscence. He is able to tolerate a regular diet and has normal bowel movements.

The patient's insulin requirements remain stable, and his blood glucose levels are within target range. He is managed with sliding scale insulin as needed.

On day two, the patient's wound dressing is assessed and found to be clean, dry, and intact. There are no signs of erythema, drainage, or increased pain.

The patient is encouraged to continue ambulating and is provided with adequate pain management as necessary. He is also started on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin.

On day three, the patient's pain is well controlled with oral pain medications, and his overall condition continues to improve. He is tolerating a regular diet without any gastrointestinal complaints.

The patient's surgical wound is healing well, and he is instructed on how to care for the incision at home. He is discharged from the hospital on day four with a plan for close follow-up.

During the patient's postoperative course, no surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, or dehiscence were noted. He recovers without any significant issues.

The patient is instructed to continue his home medications and is provided with prescriptions for pain medications and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.

He is advised to monitor his blood pressure and blood glucose levels closely and follow up with his primary care physician and surgeon as scheduled.

The patient is educated about signs of infection, including increased pain, redness, swelling, or drainage from the incision site, and is instructed to seek medical attention promptly if any of these occur.

Additionally, he is given instructions on wound care, including keeping the incision clean and dry, avoiding excessive touching, and changing dressings as needed.

The patient is also advised to gradually increase activity and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities until cleared by his surgeon.

During his postoperative period, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infections, wound dehiscence, or other surgical site issues.

In conclusion, Patient XYZ, a 52-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes, underwent surgery successfully without complications. He is discharged home with appropriate follow-up instructions and medications.
