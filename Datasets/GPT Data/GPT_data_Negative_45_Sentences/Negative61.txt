He has been managed on a combination of antihypertensive medications including lisinopril and metoprolol. His diabetes is controlled with metformin, and his lipid levels are maintained within normal limits with atorvastatin.

In addition to his medications, the patient follows a well-balanced diet and engages in regular exercise, which has helped him maintain a healthy weight. He reports no history of tobacco or alcohol use. His family history is notable for a paternal history of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and stroke.

The patient underwent preoperative clearance, which included a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. All results were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram was performed and showed sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes. He underwent a preoperative echocardiogram, which demonstrated normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%.

The patient was subsequently scheduled for surgery, and he was provided with detailed instructions about fasting before the procedure. On the day of the surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital and was brought to the operating room. Anesthesia was induced smoothly, and the procedure was performed uneventfully. The surgeon repaired the hernia using an open approach and inserted a mesh for reinforcement.

Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the recovery room where he was closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications. He was started on intravenous fluids and given analgesics for pain management. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet without any issues. His postoperative course was unremarkable and he did not experience any immediate complications.

The patient was observed in the hospital for 24 hours to ensure appropriate pain control, wound healing, and return of bowel function. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent any postoperative respiratory complications. The surgical site was regularly assessed for signs of infection, and appropriate wound care was provided.

On the day of discharge, the patient's pain was adequately controlled with oral analgesics. His vital signs remained stable, and he was able to tolerate a normal diet without any difficulties. He was educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications, including wound infection, bleeding, and urinary retention.
