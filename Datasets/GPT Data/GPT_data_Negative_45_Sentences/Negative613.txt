The patient is a 60-year-old male who presents with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He is planning to undergo surgery for a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. The patient has been experiencing significant pain and limited mobility in his right knee for the past two years, leading to a decline in his quality of life.

His hypertension is well-controlled with medications, and he has been compliant with his antihypertensive regimen. His diabetes is also managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and dietary modifications. However, he occasionally experiences high blood sugar levels, but these spikes are usually temporary and resolve with increased insulin doses.

In terms of cardiovascular health, the patient has previously undergone a coronary artery bypass graft surgery four years ago. Since then, he has been on aspirin, clopidogrel, a beta-blocker, and a statin. His cardiac function has been stable, as evidenced by regular cardiac check-ups, echocardiograms, and stress tests, all of which have shown no signs of ischemia or significant decline in his ejection fraction.

The patient's preoperative assessment reveals a well-nourished individual with a body mass index (BMI) of 28. He doesn't smoke or consume alcohol excessively. His lung function tests show no signs of any respiratory illness or impaired pulmonary function. Preoperative consultations with an anesthesiologist and a physical therapist have been conducted, ensuring the patient's readiness for the surgery and postoperative rehabilitation.

Following the total knee replacement surgery, the patient is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days for postoperative pain management, physiotherapy sessions, and wound care. He will receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections, and he will be encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and atelectasis.

Rehabilitation will be an integral part of the patient's postoperative course. Physical therapy will aim to improve his range of motion, strengthen the muscles around the knee, and restore his mobility. The patient is expected to walk with the assistance of crutches or a walker initially and gradually transition to relying on his operated knee for weight-bearing activities.

As for complications, this patient did not experience any major ones. The surgical procedure was successful, and the wound healed well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient managed his pain adequately with a combination of analgesics and physical therapy. He did not exhibit any signs of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during his hospital stay, likely due to proper prophylaxis measures.

In terms of glycemic control, the patient experienced some fluctuations in his blood sugar levels initially due to the stress of the surgery. However, his diabetes management team adjusted his insulin regimen, resulting in stabilized blood glucose levels throughout the postoperative period.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with a gradual improvement in his knee function and reduced pain. He was discharged from the hospital on day 4 with a comprehensive plan for outpatient physical therapy and scheduled follow-up appointments with his orthopedic surgeon, primary care physician, and endocrinologist to monitor his recovery and ensure optimal management of his chronic conditions.
