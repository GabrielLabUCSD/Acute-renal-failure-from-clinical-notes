Patient X is a 65-year-old male who presented with severe osteoarthritis in his right knee. He has a long-standing history of knee pain, limited range of motion, and difficulty performing daily activities due to the pain. His knee pain has progressively worsened over the past few years, limiting his overall quality of life. Despite conservative treatments such as physical therapy, corticosteroid injections, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, his symptoms have not significantly improved.

Patient X has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He takes several medications including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin. His blood pressure and lipid levels are well-controlled with his current regimen.

Given the severity of his knee pain and the substantial impact on his daily living, the decision was made for Patient X to undergo total knee replacement surgery. Preoperative assessments, including blood work, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray, were performed to ensure suitability for surgery. His renal function was within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.95 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 78 mL/min/1.73 mÂ².

Patient X underwent a successful total knee replacement procedure without any intraoperative complications. The surgical team ensured proper alignment of the prosthetic components and adequate soft tissue tensioning. The surgery lasted approximately two hours, and the estimated blood loss was minimal.

Postoperatively, Patient X was closely monitored in the recovery room, where his vital signs remained stable. He received intravenous antibiotics as per protocol and was started on prophylactic deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Patient X was encouraged to perform early mobilization and physical therapy to facilitate his recovery.

During his hospital stay, Patient X experienced some mild pain, which was effectively managed with oral analgesics. The surgical wound remained clean and without signs of infection. Physical therapy sessions were conducted daily to help him regain strength, improve range of motion, and restore functional ability. Patient X was educated on proper wound care and signs of infection upon discharge.

Overall, Patient X had a smooth postoperative course with no major complications. He made steady progress in his rehabilitation, demonstrating improvements in pain control, weight-bearing ability, and joint mobility. His diabetes and blood pressure remained under control throughout his hospital stay, with consistent fingerstick glucose monitoring and appropriate management of antihypertensive medications.

Patient X was scheduled for a follow-up visit two weeks after surgery to assess his progress and ensure proper healing of the surgical site. At the follow-up appointment, the surgical wound was well-healed, with no signs of infection. Patient X reported significant improvement in his knee pain and functional ability, expressing satisfaction with the surgery's outcome.

In summary, Patient X, a 65-year-old male with severe osteoarthritis, underwent an uncomplicated total knee replacement surgery. His postoperative course was smooth, characterized by effective pain management, early mobilization, and steady progress in rehabilitation. Patient X's medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes was well-managed during his hospital stay. He experienced no complications, and his surgical wound healed without any signs of infection. Follow-up assessment revealed significant improvement in pain control and functional ability, indicating a successful surgical outcome.
