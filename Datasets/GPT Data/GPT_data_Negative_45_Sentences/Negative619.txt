The patient is a 54-year-old female who presented with symptoms of chronic back pain, which has been worsening over the past two years. She has a medical history significant for osteoarthritis, hypertension, and obesity. The patient has previously undergone multiple conservative measures, including medication trials, physical therapy, and epidural steroid injections, but her symptoms persist.

In light of her persistent symptoms, the patient and her healthcare team have decided that surgical intervention is warranted. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits, she opted for a lumbar laminectomy and fusion surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a comprehensive medical evaluation. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, were within normal limits. Her renal function, as evidenced by a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, was within normal range. It is important to mention that the patient did not have any signs or symptoms of acute renal failure at presentation.

Her medical team also performed a thorough medication review, identifying any medications that may pose a risk during surgery. For example, she was instructed to discontinue non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to their potential effects on platelet function and bleeding.

During the surgery, the patient was placed under general anesthesia. The procedure involved a midline incision in the lumbar region, followed by a laminectomy to remove a portion of the vertebral bone to relieve pressure on the spinal nerves. Additionally, a spinal fusion was performed using pedicle screws and rods to stabilize the affected vertebrae.

Postoperatively, the patient was continuously monitored in the recovery room and then transferred to the surgical ward. She received appropriate pain management through a combination of intravenous and oral opioids, with a clear improvement in her pain levels compared to the preoperative period. The patient was mobilized under the guidance of physical therapy to promote early ambulation and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and did not experience any major complications, such as wound infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or nerve injury. She was discharged on postoperative day four with appropriate wound care instructions, pain medications, and physical therapy recommendations for ongoing recovery and strengthening.

During her follow-up appointments, the patient reported a significant reduction in her back pain, along with improvements in her mobility and overall quality of life. Her surgical incision exhibited appropriate healing without signs of infection or wound dehiscence.

In conclusion, this 54-year-old female patient with chronic back pain presented for surgical intervention due to the failure of conservative measures. She underwent a lumbar laminectomy and fusion surgery without perioperative complications. Her postoperative course has been uneventful, and she has experienced significant pain relief and functional improvement as a result of the surgery.
