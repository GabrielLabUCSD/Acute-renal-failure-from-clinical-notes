On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

Laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, are within normal limits. His renal function, specifically, is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. His liver function tests are also normal.

A preoperative electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of ischemic changes. Additionally, a chest X-ray shows no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy performed 10 years ago without any postoperative complications. He has not had any previous surgeries since then.

The patient has been educated regarding the surgery he is going to undergo, and all of his questions have been addressed. He understands the potential risks and benefits of the surgery and has signed the informed consent.

During the surgery, the medical team took precautions to minimize the patient's risk of complications such as infection and bleeding. The procedure went smoothly without any intraoperative complications.

Following the surgery, the patient was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for possible complications such as pain, bleeding, or infection. He was provided with appropriate analgesics to manage postoperative pain and was mobilized as tolerated.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no evidence of wound infection or dehiscence. He did not experience any excessive bleeding or hematomas. Daily wound dressing changes were performed, and the surgical site showed signs of normal healing.

Pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis were not observed in the patient. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to maintain optimal pulmonary function.

The patient's blood pressure was regularly monitored, and it remained stable throughout his hospital stay. His antihypertensive medications were resumed postoperatively, and his blood pressure was well-controlled.

He was started on a prophylactic dose of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis. No signs or symptoms of venous thromboembolism were observed during his hospital stay.

The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged home in stable condition on the third postoperative day. He was advised to continue his regular medications, including antihypertensives and statins.

During the follow-up visit one week after surgery, the patient reported no significant complaints. His surgical wound was healing well with no signs of infection or dehiscence. He was advised to continue wound care instructions and refrain from heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next few weeks.

In summary, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia underwent surgery for hernia repair. His perioperative course was uneventful, with no complications such as infection, bleeding, or pulmonary complications. The surgical wound healed well, and the patient was discharged home in stable condition. He will continue his regular medications and follow up with his healthcare provider for further evaluation.
