Patient Summary:

This is a patient with a medical history who is planning to undergo surgery. The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He takes medications including lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin.

In terms of family history, the patient's father had a history of heart disease and his mother had a history of stroke. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

The patient has been experiencing worsening symptoms related to his medical conditions, including increased blood pressure readings, elevated cholesterol levels, and difficulty controlling his blood sugar levels. As a result, surgery has been scheduled to address these issues.

During preoperative evaluation, the patient was found to have well-controlled blood pressure with his current medication regimen. His fasting blood glucose levels were within target range, and his lipid profile revealed mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

The surgical procedure planned is a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) due to significant coronary artery disease identified on cardiac catheterization. The patient also has mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45%.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent additional evaluations, which included a stress test that showed evidence of ischemia and a consultation with a cardiologist who deemed the patient suitable for surgical intervention. The patient also received counseling on smoking cessation and was advised to continue taking his regular medications.

The patient underwent surgery as planned without any intraoperative complications. A triple vessel bypass was performed, and the surgical team reported no issues during the procedure. The patient was extubated and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) postoperatively.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remained stable and oxygen saturations were within normal limits. He was started on a postoperative pain management regimen that included opioid medications, as well as antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy to prevent thrombosis. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

Over the course of the next few days, the patient's pain gradually improved, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet. Physical therapy was initiated to improve his mobility. The patient's blood pressure was closely monitored with frequent adjustments to his antihypertensive medications to maintain optimal control.

The patient had a routine postoperative echocardiogram, which showed no significant changes in his left ventricular function compared to the preoperative assessment. However, he experienced a transient episode of atrial fibrillation on the third postoperative day, which resolved with medical management and did not require further intervention.

There were no signs of infection at the surgical site or in other parts of the body, and the patient's laboratory values, including white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, remained within normal limits throughout the postoperative course.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was transferred out of the SICU to a cardiac step-down unit, where he continued to recover well. His pain was well controlled with oral medications, and he actively participated in rehabilitation exercises.

The patient's blood pressure continued to be stabilized, and his blood glucose levels remained within an acceptable range. Routine follow-up electrocardiograms showed no signs of new ischemic changes.

After a total of 10 days in the hospital, the patient was discharged home in stable condition. He was provided with a comprehensive discharge plan, including instructions for follow-up appointments with his primary care physician, cardiologist, and cardiac rehabilitation center. The patient was counseled on medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and the importance of regular exercise and a heart-healthy diet.

In the subsequent weeks after discharge, the patient followed up with his physicians as recommended. His recovery continued to progress well, and he gradually returned to his normal daily activities. He reported minimal pain and no complications related to the surgical procedure.

In summary, this patient with a significant medical history underwent a successful coronary artery bypass graft without intraoperative complications. His postoperative course was largely uneventful, with only a transient episode of atrial fibrillation, which resolved without intervention. The patient was discharged home in stable condition and continued to recover well during follow-up.
