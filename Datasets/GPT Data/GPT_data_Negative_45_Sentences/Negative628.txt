The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with severe arthritis in the left knee and has decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, which are well-controlled with medications. The patient’s preoperative lab work showed normal renal function with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73m².

His surgical history includes an appendectomy at age 20 and a cholecystectomy at age 45, both without any complications. The patient does not have a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Additionally, he does not smoke nor have any known drug allergies. The patient does not partake in regular exercise but is willing to participate in postoperative physical therapy to aid in his recovery.

Regarding medications, the patient takes metformin, lisinopril, and amlodipine daily to manage his diabetes and hypertension. He also takes a daily aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events. The patient's blood pressure readings have been consistently within the normal range, averaging around 120/80 mmHg.

The anesthesiologist evaluated the patient and recommended a spinal anesthesia with sedation as the preferred method. During the surgery, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics and sequential compression devices were applied to minimize the risk of developing a DVT. The surgery lasted approximately two hours, and there were no intraoperative complications noted.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room. He received intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and his pain was managed with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to prevent postoperative atelectasis. The patient was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet and was subsequently advanced to a regular diet.

Within the first 24 hours post-surgery, physical therapy began to assist the patient with ambulation and range of motion exercises. The patient was able to bear weight on the affected leg with the assistance of a walker. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any signs of infection or wound complications. The patient's pain was effectively controlled with oral analgesics.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day. He was provided with a prescription for oral opioids for pain management at home and instructed to continue his physical therapy sessions on an outpatient basis. The patient was educated on signs and symptoms of infection, DVT, and PE, and advised to seek immediate medical attention if any of these were to occur.

During the follow-up appointment two weeks later, the patient reported improved range of motion and decreased pain. The surgical incision appeared well-healed without any signs of infection. At this time, the patient was advised to continue physical therapy exercises at home and to gradually increase his level of activity. He was allowed to bear full weight on the affected leg and was no longer required to use a walker.

The patient was closely monitored for any potential complications during his recovery period, such as wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism - however, he did not experience any of these complications. His renal function remained stable, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL and GFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m² at the six-week postoperative follow-up visit.

In conclusion, this 55-year-old male patient successfully underwent total knee replacement surgery for severe arthritis. His preoperative renal function was normal, and he did not experience any complications during the surgical procedure or in the immediate postoperative period. The patient's recovery was smooth, and he had no signs of infection or wound complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he made satisfactory progress during physical therapy. Renal function remained stable, and he did not experience any complications associated with his kidneys throughout the postoperative period.
