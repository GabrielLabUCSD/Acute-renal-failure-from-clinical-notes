The patient, Ms. X, is a 40-year-old female who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension, for which she takes medication. The patient has no known drug allergies. She is an active smoker with a 15-pack-year history.

The patient had a preoperative workup that includes a complete blood count, chemistry panel, coagulation profile, and a chest X-ray. Her lab results were within normal limits, and the chest X-ray showed no abnormalities. The patient was given instructions to discontinue smoking two weeks prior to the surgery.

During the surgery, the patient was administered general anesthesia without any complications. The hernia repair was performed without any complications as well. The patient experienced minimal blood loss throughout the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and closely monitored for signs of complications. She was given pain medication as needed and provided with adequate nutrition and hydration. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform breathing exercises to ensure optimal recovery.

On the second day after surgery, the patient developed a low-grade fever of 100.4Â°F. Workup was done, including blood cultures, which came back negative. The fever was likely related to a postoperative inflammatory response and resolved with supportive treatment.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. She had regular follow-up appointments in the surgical clinic and exhibited good progress in her wound healing. The surgical site was clean without signs of infection or dehiscence.

Ms. X remained smoke-free postoperatively and was provided with smoking cessation resources to ensure she continues this healthy lifestyle change. She was educated about proper wound care and given instructions for gradually increasing her physical activity.

At the two-week follow-up visit, the patient had a well-healed incision with no signs of scarring or sutures complications. She reported minimal residual pain and was able to resume her normal activities of daily living without limitations.

Overall, Ms. X's postoperative course was uncomplicated and she had a successful recovery. The surgery achieved the desired outcome of hernia repair without any immediate or long-term complications. The patient was satisfied with the surgical outcome and expressed gratitude for the healthcare team's support throughout the process.
