The patient is a 60-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to have surgery. He has a long-standing history of hypertension and has been on medication for several years. His blood pressure is well-controlled with his current regimen of lisinopril 10 mg daily. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is currently managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient has a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, for which he takes atorvastatin 40 mg daily. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, with a myocardial infarction three years ago. He underwent coronary angioplasty with stent placement at that time and is currently asymptomatic.

The patient does not have any known allergies or sensitivities. His surgical history is significant for a cholecystectomy five years ago, without any complications noted. He has not had any previous surgeries apart from this.

The patient's current physical examination is unremarkable. His vital signs are stable, and his laboratory results are within normal limits. He had a recent preoperative evaluation, which revealed no concerning findings. His fasting blood glucose was 120 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin A1c was 7.2%.

Based on the recommendations from his surgeon and anesthesiologist, the patient has been instructed to stop taking metformin two days prior to the surgery due to the potential risk of lactic acidosis. He will continue taking his other medications up until the day of surgery with sips of water as allowed.

In terms of his postoperative course, the patient recovered well and was vitally stable throughout the procedure. He tolerated the surgery without any immediate complications. Following the surgery, his pain was well-managed with a combination of opioids and non-opioid analgesics, and he was able to eat and ambulate normally.

The patient was monitored for any signs of infection, such as fever or increasing white blood cell count, but none were noted. He did not experience any respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis. There were no signs of cardiovascular complications, and his blood pressure remained stable postoperatively.

The patient did experience some postoperative constipation, likely due to the opioid pain medications. He was started on a bowel regimen that included stool softeners and laxatives, which successfully resolved the issue. He had no issues with urinary retention or urinary tract infections.

Although the patient experienced minimal postoperative complications, he did develop a superficial surgical site infection at the incision site. It was managed with local wound care, antibiotics, and close monitoring. The infection resolved completely without further complications.

In conclusion, the patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, had a planned surgery without significant complications. His postoperative course was uneventful apart from a superficial surgical site infection, which was managed appropriately. The patient is currently in stable condition and will continue to be monitored during the recovery period.
