The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He had a previous myocardial infarction two years ago and has undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. His current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin.

The patient has a family history of coronary artery disease, as his father had multiple cardiac events. He is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. He has been compliant with his medications and has been managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.

His preoperative workup includes electrocardiography, which showed normal sinus rhythm, and echocardiography, which revealed preserved left ventricular function. His bloodwork, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function tests, was within normal limits. His fasting blood glucose level was also well-controlled.

The patient had a consultation with an anesthesiologist due to his medical history. The anesthesia team determined that he is a moderate-risk surgical candidate due to his cardiac history. They recommended a preoperative beta-blocker to ensure blood pressure control during surgery.

During the surgery, the patient was monitored carefully with invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and continuous electrocardiography. He received general anesthesia without any complications. The surgical procedure was successful, and the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery.

In the postoperative course, the patient was closely monitored for pain control, vital signs, and wound healing. He was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. His blood glucose levels remained stable, and his diabetes management was continued with oral medications.

The patient did not experience any immediate postoperative complications such as wound infections or bleeding. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not require any additional interventions or medications. He was discharged from the hospital four days after the surgery.

During the follow-up visit one week later, the patient reported good pain control and satisfactory wound healing. He did not experience any postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence or infection. His blood glucose levels remained well-controlled, and he did not require any changes in his diabetes management.

The patient was advised to continue his regular medications and was scheduled for a follow-up visit in six weeks. At that time, he will undergo a stress test to assess his cardiac function as part of his long-term cardiac care.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery with no immediate postoperative complications. His medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease were carefully managed during the perioperative period, contributing to a favorable postoperative course.
