The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history that includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His hypertension is well-controlled with medication, and he has been following a low-sodium diet. His hyperlipidemia is managed with statin therapy, and his last lipid panel results were within the target range. His diabetes is controlled with a combination of oral medications and lifestyle modifications, and he monitors his blood glucose regularly.

In terms of his surgical history, the patient had appendectomy performed 20 years ago and an elective knee arthroscopy 5 years ago. He tolerated both procedures well without any complications. He has no known drug allergies and is up to date on immunizations. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol excessively.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, heart rate is 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. His general appearance is normal, and he is in no acute distress. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and there are no signs of respiratory distress. Abdominal examination is unremarkable with no masses or tenderness. Extremities are without edema or deformities, and pulses are normal bilaterally.

Laboratory investigations show a complete blood count within normal limits, with hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL and normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Renal function is normal, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Liver function tests are within normal limits as well. Fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, and HbA1c is 7.2%, indicating fair control of diabetes. Coagulation profile and electrolytes are within normal ranges. Urinalysis is negative for any abnormalities.

The patient has been educated on the surgical procedure, including the risks and benefits involved. He has provided informed consent for the surgery. Preoperatively, he will be instructed to follow specific fasting guidelines and discontinue any medications that may interfere with the procedure. Antibiotic prophylaxis will be administered as per the surgical protocol to prevent infection.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room and then transferred to a regular nursing unit. Pain management will be provided through a combination of oral analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia if necessary. Early ambulation and deep breathing exercises will be encouraged to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis. The surgical site will be closely monitored for signs of infection.

Complications that could potentially occur postoperatively include wound infection, bleeding, thromboembolism, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. However, it is important to note that acute renal failure is not listed as a potential complication for this patient. The patient will be followed closely by the surgical team and appropriate interventions will be implemented as needed.
