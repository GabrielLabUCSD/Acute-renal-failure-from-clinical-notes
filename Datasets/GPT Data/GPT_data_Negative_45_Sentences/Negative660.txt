He does not have a history of bleeding disorders or abnormal coagulation profile. The patient denies any known drug allergies and has never experienced an adverse reaction to anesthesia in the past.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient's vital signs were stable, with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities, and his laboratory investigations were all within normal limits, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function tests.

Following the surgery, Patient X had a smooth postoperative course. He was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit and subsequently transferred to the surgical ward.
