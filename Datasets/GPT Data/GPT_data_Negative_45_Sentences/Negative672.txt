The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has a long-standing history of smoking and alcohol abuse. Additionally, he has a family history of coronary artery disease.

The patient's hypertension is well controlled with medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. His blood pressure has been consistently within normal range for the past year.

His type 2 diabetes mellitus is managed with oral medications, including metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. His hemoglobin A1c levels have been stable at around 6.5% to 7.0%.

The patient's hyperlipidemia is also well controlled with statin therapy. His low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are within target range.

In terms of his obesity, the patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32. Despite counseling on lifestyle modifications, he has been unable to lose weight. He does not have any weight-related complications such as sleep apnea or joint pain.

The patient's smoking history is significant, with 40 pack-years. He still smokes half a pack per day. He has expressed willingness to quit but has been unsuccessful so far.

Regarding alcohol abuse, the patient consumes approximately 5 to 6 standard drinks per day. He has been referred to substance abuse counseling services prior to surgery.

On physical examination, the patient is obese but otherwise appears well. His heart sounds are regular, and no murmurs are heard. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is no peripheral edema or evidence of organomegaly.

The patient's preoperative laboratory workup, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, is within normal limits.

A preoperative electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

Given the patient's medical history, he is at increased risk for perioperative complications, particularly respiratory complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia due to his obesity and history of smoking.

As part of his preoperative evaluation, the patient undergoes a chest X-ray and spirometry to assess his pulmonary function. The chest X-ray shows no acute abnormalities. Spirometry reveals an forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 70% predicted, indicating mild obstructive lung disease.

The patient is informed about the potential risks and benefits of surgery, including the increased risk of respiratory complications.

He undergoes surgery under general anesthesia without any immediate complications.

In the postoperative period, the patient is closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of respiratory distress. His vital signs remain stable, and there are no immediate concerns.

He is started on incentive spirometry and deep breathing exercises to promote lung expansion and prevent atelectasis.

The patient is transferred to the surgical ward later in the day, where he continues to receive close postoperative care.

He is placed on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections.

Pain control is managed with a combination of intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient's pain is well managed, and he is able to perform deep breathing exercises effectively.

The patient's blood glucose levels are closely monitored postoperatively to avoid hyperglycemia. Insulin is administered as needed to maintain glycemic control.

The patient remains hemodynamically stable throughout his postoperative course.

On the second postoperative day, the patient develops a fever with a temperature of 38.5Â°C. A thorough evaluation is conducted, including blood cultures, and he is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible infection.

Chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia, and urine analysis is negative for urinary tract infection. The fever is presumed to be due to a surgical site infection, and wound care is intensified.

The patient's fever resolves within a few days, and he shows improvement clinically.

His postoperative recovery continues without further complications.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient is mobilized with physical therapy to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

He is started on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin injections to further reduce the risk of thromboembolism.

The patient is able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues and is encouraged to resume his smoking cessation efforts.

Chest X-ray is repeated on the fifth postoperative day, revealing complete resolution of any previously seen surgical changes.

On the sixth postoperative day, the patient is discharged home with appropriate wound care instructions.

He is advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his comorbidities and to continue his smoking cessation efforts.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a surgical site infection, which was successfully treated with antibiotics.

Given the patient's history of smoking and alcohol abuse, continued counseling and support will be crucial in assisting him with long-term lifestyle modifications and adherence to medications.
