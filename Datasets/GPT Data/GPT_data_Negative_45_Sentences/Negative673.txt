The patient is a middle-aged male planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history which includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been adequately managed on antihypertensive medications such as losartan and amlodipine, oral hypoglycemics including metformin, and statin therapy for his dyslipidemia.

Although the patient's blood pressure is well controlled with medication, he has not achieved target goals for his blood glucose levels and lipid profile. His current HbA1c is 8.5%, and he has LDL cholesterol values above 160 mg/dL despite taking a statin. It is important to optimize his glycemic and lipid control preoperatively to reduce the risk of complications.

The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having had a myocardial infarction at a young age. Additionally, the patient has a sedentary lifestyle and a body mass index (BMI) of 30, placing him in the obese category. These factors contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular events during and after surgery.

In terms of surgical risk assessment, the patient is classified as having an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of 2, indicating mild systemic disease. Preoperative laboratory investigations show normal complete blood counts, liver function, and renal function, except for a mild elevation in serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dL). This mild impairment is likely related to his underlying hypertension and may not significantly impact surgical outcomes.

The patient has a known medication allergy to penicillin, but other than that, there are no specific drug allergies recorded. He reports occasional use of over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for musculoskeletal pain, which he should discontinue before surgery due to the risk of bleeding.

During the preoperative consultation, the patient expresses concern regarding pain management post-surgery. Given his history of chronic pain, the surgical team plans to provide a multimodal analgesic approach, combining non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with the use of opioids. The goal is to optimize pain control while minimizing the risk of opioid-related adverse effects.

The patient's surgery is scheduled under general anesthesia, and appropriate perioperative fasting guidelines will be followed to prevent aspiration. As part of the patient's medical optimization, an echocardiogram is ordered to assess his cardiac function and screen for any underlying abnormalities.

Postoperatively, the patient is transferred to the recovery area for monitoring. He initially experiences some pain at the surgical site, which is controlled with intravenous opioids. The patient is also started on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy, typically low molecular weight heparin, to minimize the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) during his hospital stay.

The patient's recovery progresses well, and he is transitioned to oral pain medications. As anticipated, he experiences some constipation related to opioid use. Non-pharmacological measures such as adequate hydration, dietary fiber, and mobility encouragement are instituted to alleviate this side effect.

On the third day post-surgery, the patient develops a fever of 101Â°F along with increased pain at the surgical site. Blood cultures are obtained, and he is started on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Surgical site infection is suspected, and wound exploration might be necessary if the symptoms worsen.

The patient's blood cultures eventually yield growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), confirming the diagnosis of surgical site infection. He undergoes wound exploration, and an MRSA abscess is drained and sampled for culture-specific antibiotic therapy. Intravenous antibiotics are continued for a total of two weeks.

Despite the complication of surgical site infection, the patient's recovery remains on track. The surgical wound shows signs of healing, and the patient's pain gradually decreases. His blood glucose levels and lipid profile are being closely monitored to prevent any perioperative complications related to his diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient receives postoperative physiotherapy to facilitate early mobilization and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. VTE prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is continued until his ambulation is restored.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient experiences transient confusion and forgetfulness. A neurologic examination reveals no focal deficits, and laboratory investigations show normal electrolytes and thyroid function. The patient is diagnosed with postoperative delirium, likely multifactorial in etiology due to factors such as age, anesthesia, and surgical stress. Low-dose antipsychotic medication is initiated, and the patient's symptoms gradually resolve.

Overall, despite the surgical site infection and transient postoperative delirium, the patient's surgical recovery progresses without major complications. He is discharged on oral antibiotics and scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the surgical clinic to monitor wound healing. Additionally, he will be referred to a diabetes specialist to optimize his glycemic control and address any potential long-term implications of his surgery on his diabetes management.
