The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. The patient has a history of multiple recurrent hernias throughout his adult life, with the most recent one being on the left inguinal region. He underwent a previous inguinal hernia repair on the right side 10 years ago. 

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on a daily medication regimen of lisinopril 20 mg. His diabetes is also well-managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. The patient has regular follow-ups with his primary care physician and has no complications related to his chronic conditions. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and has never had prior adverse reactions to anesthesia. His surgical team has discussed the procedure with him and informed him about the potential risks and benefits associated with the surgery. The patient has provided informed consent and is fully aware of the planned procedure and its potential complications.

In preparation for surgery, the patient has undergone routine preoperative laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, renal function panel, liver function tests, and coagulation studies. All his laboratory results are within normal limits, including his renal function panel. His estimated glomerular filtration rate is 95 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient has been instructed to adhere to a clear liquid diet starting the day before surgery and to refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight on the day of the procedure. He has been advised to take his regular medications with small sips of water on the morning of surgery.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrives at the hospital with no complaints or acute issues. He is brought to the preoperative holding area where he is prepared for surgery. The anesthesia team evaluates him, and a general anesthesia plan is formulated for the procedure. 

During the surgery, the patient is positioned on the operating table and general anesthesia is induced. The surgical team successfully repairs the hernia using a tension-free mesh technique. The procedure lasts approximately one hour, and the patient is stable throughout.

After the surgery, the patient is taken to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for monitoring. He awakens from anesthesia without any complications and is moderately comfortable. He rates his pain level as a 3 out of 10. His vital signs remain stable, and he is monitored for any signs of postoperative complications.

The patient is given intravenous pain medication for pain control as needed. He is encouraged to take deep breaths and ambulate in order to prevent respiratory complications and decrease the risk of thrombosis formation. The patient tolerates these activities well and does not exhibit any signs of postoperative respiratory compromise or deep vein thrombosis.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's pain level improves to a 2 out of 10. He is transitioned to oral pain medication and his ambulation is continued. He is well-hydrated and tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. The patient's vital signs remain stable, and he is cleared for discharge by the surgical team.

On the second postoperative day, the patient's pain level continues to improve, with only occasional mild discomfort at the surgical site. His incision is clean and dry without any signs of infection. The patient reports no other issues or concerns since the surgery.

The patient is discharged home on the third postoperative day with instructions to continue pain medication as needed and to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next two weeks. He is advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a wound check and to ensure proper healing.

The patient's postoperative recovery continues to progress well. He reports minimal pain at the incision site and is able to resume his regular daily activities without any difficulties. His follow-up appointment with the primary care physician reveals good wound healing and no signs of infection.

Throughout the patient's postoperative course, he does not experience any complications, such as wound dehiscence, surgical site infection, or seroma formation. He complies with all postoperative instructions and monitors himself for any signs of infection or complications. He reports no issues during the follow-up period.

The patient's postoperative recovery is unremarkable and he experiences a smooth transition back to his normal daily routine. He is satisfied with the surgical outcome and expresses gratitude for the successful repair of his hernia. The patient's primary care physician continues to monitor his chronic conditions and provides ongoing care.
