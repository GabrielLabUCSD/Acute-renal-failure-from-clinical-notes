The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 55-year-old male who has a significant medical history. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Mr. Smith presents to the hospital with complaints of severe knee pain and functionality impairment. His knee pain has progressively worsened over the past year, limiting his ability to walk and perform daily activities.

Mr. Smith has tried conservative management for his knee pain, including physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but has not experienced significant relief. As a result, he has consulted with an orthopedic surgeon who has recommended a total knee replacement surgery to alleviate his symptoms and improve his quality of life.

During the preoperative evaluation, Mr. Smith undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure he is a suitable candidate for surgery. His cardiologist performs a stress test, which reveals stable exercise-induced angina without ischemic changes. His coronary artery disease is well-controlled with medication, and he does not exhibit any signs of active ischemia. His diabetes is also well-managed with oral hypoglycemic agents.

Lab workup prior to surgery reveals normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and electrolyte levels. His renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ². Despite this, precautions are taken to avoid any potential perioperative renal complications.

Mr. Smith is instructed to discontinue any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prior to surgery to minimize bleeding risks. He is also advised to continue taking his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications on the day of surgery.

The surgery is performed under general anesthesia, and Mr. Smith undergoes an uneventful total knee replacement. Intraoperatively, there are no complications, and he is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.

In the immediate postoperative period, Mr. Smith is closely monitored for any signs of complications, such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Prophylactic measures, including mechanical compression devices and postoperative anticoagulation, are implemented to minimize the risk of thromboembolic events.

Mr. Smith's pain is managed with a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics. Physical therapy is initiated on the first postoperative day to facilitate early mobilization and joint range of motion. He is encouraged to perform exercises and ambulate with assistance as his pain allows.

During his hospital stay, Mr. Smith receives appropriate wound care and is provided with education on self-care and incision care upon discharge. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is administered according to the surgical site infection prevention guidelines.

His postoperative course remains unremarkable, and he demonstrates good progress with pain control and functional recovery. His vital signs remain stable, and he maintains adequate glycemic and blood pressure control during his hospital stay.

On the third postoperative day, Mr. Smith is ambulating with minimal assistance and achieving satisfactory joint range of motion. His surgical wound is well-approximated and shows no signs of infection. He is provided with a comprehensive postoperative plan for continuation of physical therapy and follow-up with his primary care physician.

No major complications are encountered during Mr. Smith's hospitalization. His renal function remains stable throughout his stay, with no evidence of acute kidney injury or electrolyte imbalances. He is discharged home with appropriate pain medications and instructions for self-care, including wound care and medication management.

Upon follow-up visits with his primary care physician, Mr. Smith continues to show improvement in functionality and pain management. He reports a significant reduction in knee pain and a better quality of life postoperatively. Mr. Smith's surgical outcome is regarded as successful, given his overall improvement in symptoms and absence of major postoperative complications. His renal function remains within normal limits, demonstrating no adverse impact from the surgery.
