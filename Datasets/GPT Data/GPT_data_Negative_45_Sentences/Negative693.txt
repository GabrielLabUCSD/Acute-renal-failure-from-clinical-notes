The patient is a 52-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been managing his diabetes with diet and exercise, and his blood pressure and lipid levels have been relatively well controlled with medication.

Additionally, the patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction in his late 50s. Therefore, the patient underwent a stress test and echocardiogram prior to surgery, which revealed no significant abnormalities or signs of ischemia.

In terms of the patient's surgical history, he previously had a cholecystectomy 5 years ago without any complications or issues. His surgical team is aware of this prior surgery and is confident in their ability to mitigate any potential risks or complications.

The patient's preoperative labs were within normal limits, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies. His renal function tests were also within normal range, indicating no underlying kidney disease.

However, the patient does have a history of smoking, with a 20 pack-year history. Despite attempts to quit, he continues to smoke about half a pack a day. This smoking history puts him at an increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications, and the surgical team has been proactive in providing smoking cessation resources and counseling to help him quit before surgery.

The patient's surgical procedure is scheduled to be an elective inguinal hernia repair. The hernia was incidentally discovered during a routine physical examination, and the patient has been asymptomatic from it. Due to the elective nature of the surgery, the patient has been fully informed of the risks and benefits and has provided informed consent.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived fasting, and his vital signs were stable. He was appropriately prepped and draped for surgery, and a regional nerve block was performed for pain control. The surgical procedure was uneventful, with no complications noted intraoperatively.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery area, where he was monitored closely for several hours. He received frequent assessments of his vital signs and pain level, as well as neurovascular checks to ensure there was no compromise to the operative site.

The patient was started on a clear liquid diet and was able to tolerate it without any signs of nausea or vomiting. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's pain was managed with a combination of oral analgesics and intravenous opioids as needed. His pain level remained well-controlled throughout his postoperative course.

The patient did not experience any significant complications during his hospital stay. His surgical site remained clean and free from any signs of infection. His bowels resumed normal function within the expected timeframe, and he did not experience any urinary retention issues.

After 2 days of uneventful recovery, the patient was discharged home to continue his recuperation. He was prescribed oral pain medications for use at home and instructed to follow up with his primary care physician in 1 week to ensure proper healing and monitor for any potential complications.

In terms of renal complications, the patient did not experience acute renal failure or any other significant changes in his renal function postoperatively. His renal function remained stable within normal limits throughout his hospital stay.

To conclude, this 52-year-old male patient underwent an uneventful elective hernia repair surgery. His medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus was well-managed, and his preoperative testing did not reveal any concerning findings. The patient's postoperative course was smooth, with appropriate pain control and timely recovery. He did not experience any complications related to his surgery or renal function.
