The patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. He presents to the clinic for preoperative evaluation as he has been scheduled for surgery for the treatment of a herniated disc in his lumbar spine. The patient reports chronic lower back pain radiating to the right leg for the past six months, which has not responded to conservative management.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 78 beats per minute. Physical examination reveals reduced range of motion in the lumbar spine, with tenderness on palpation. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation and weakness in the right lower extremity, corresponding to the dermatome and myotome innervated by the affected nerve root.

Laboratory investigations are within normal limits, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. The patient's glycosylated hemoglobin level is 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control. An electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities.

The patient has been advised to discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anticoagulant therapy five days prior to surgery. He has been instructed to continue taking his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. Smoking cessation counseling has been provided, as the patient is a moderate smoker.

Given the patient's obesity, a consultation with a nutritionist has been arranged to optimize his perioperative nutritional status and to promote weight loss. The patient has been advised to increase physical activity and follows a low-calorie diet in the preoperative period.

The surgery is scheduled to be performed under general anesthesia. The anesthesiologist should be aware of the patient's medical history and consider the potential risks associated with diabetes and obesity, such as difficult airway management and increased susceptibility to infections. Adequate perioperative glucose control should be maintained to minimize the risk of wound complications.

Following the surgery, the patient is closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit. Vital signs remain stable, and he is able to maintain adequate oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen. The patient is commenced on a postoperative multimodal analgesic regimen, which includes non-opioid analgesics and a patient-controlled analgesia pump for breakthrough pain management.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experiences some pain at the surgical site, which is effectively managed with analgesics. He is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and respiratory complications. Physical therapy is initiated to ensure optimal functional recovery and prevent postoperative complications.

Over the course of his postoperative recovery, the patient's pain gradually improves. The sensory deficits and weakness in the right lower extremity also begin to resolve. The patient's glycemic control remains stable, and his blood pressure is well-controlled. Wound healing progresses without any signs of infection or dehiscence.

The patient is discharged home on the fourth day following surgery, with instructions for wound care, appropriate pain management strategies, and rehabilitation exercises to improve range of motion and strengthen the core muscles. He is advised to refrain from heavy lifting or strenuous activities for at least six weeks.

During the two-week postoperative follow-up visit, the patient reports satisfactory pain relief and gradual improvement in mobility. The wound is healing well without any signs of infection. The patient is scheduled for physical therapy sessions to aid in his functional recovery.

In the subsequent follow-up visits, the patient continues to show steady improvement in pain intensity and functional status. He progresses well with physical therapy and gradually returns to his regular activities. The patient's glycemic control remains stable, and blood pressure remains within the desired range.

There are no complications noted in the patient's postoperative course. He successfully undergoes rehabilitation and achieves a good outcome, with resolution of his lower back pain and improvement in his quality of life. The patient expresses satisfaction with the surgical intervention and overall management he received.
