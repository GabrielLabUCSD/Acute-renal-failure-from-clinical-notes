He has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are all well-controlled with medications. He denied any known drug allergies. His surgical history includes an appendectomy at the age of 15. 

On physical examination, the patient appears to be in overall good health. His vital signs are within normal limits, and he has no evidence of organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The respiratory examination is unremarkable, with clear breath sounds bilaterally.

Laboratory investigations included a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation profile, and liver function tests, all of which were within normal limits. The patient also had an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm.

The patient was counseled by the surgical team regarding all aspects of the surgery, including the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives. Preoperative instructions were given, including fasting guidelines and medication adjustments. The patient agreed to the surgery and signed the informed consent form.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital and was prepared for the procedure. After the induction of anesthesia, the surgery was performed without any complications. The intraoperative course was uneventful, with no significant blood loss or transfusion requirements.

Following surgery, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for any postoperative complications. He was started on intravenous fluids and received appropriate pain management. The patient experienced minor postoperative discomfort, but it was well-controlled with analgesics.

Over the next few days, the patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. He was mobilized early and encouraged to ambulate to prevent postoperative complications, such as deep vein thrombosis. The patient was also placed on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any surgical site infections.

On the fifth day after surgery, the patient developed a low-grade fever and increased pain at the surgical site. Blood and wound cultures were obtained, and he was started on intravenous antibiotics. The fever and pain gradually resolved, and the patient's condition improved over the course of a few days. The culture results were negative for any bacterial growth.

In the weeks following surgery, the patient continued to recover well. He had regular follow-up visits, which included wound checks and assessments of his overall condition. The surgical wound healed without any complications or signs of infection.

In summary, the patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent surgery without perioperative complications. His postoperative course was generally uneventful, except for a transient fever and increased pain at the surgical site that resolved with a short course of antibiotics. The patient is currently doing well and is on track for a full recovery.
