The patient, a 58-year-old male, has a significant medical history, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mild peripheral vascular disease. The patient has been well managed on medications for these conditions.

He has been experiencing worsening symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, including pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. Conservative management measures, such as physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections, have provided only temporary relief.

Due to the significant impact on the patient's daily activities and quality of life, the decision to proceed with knee replacement surgery was made. Preoperative assessment showed adequate cardiovascular and respiratory function, making him a suitable candidate for surgery.

The patient was advised to discontinue any blood-thinning medications a week before surgery to minimize bleeding risk. His blood pressure and blood glucose were closely monitored in the preoperative period to maintain optimal control.

Knee replacement surgery was performed successfully under general anesthesia. The procedure involved removing damaged cartilage and bone and replacing it with artificial joint components. The patient tolerated the surgery well, and there were no intraoperative complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and closely monitored for any immediate complications, such as bleeding or infection. Pain management was ensured through a combination of oral and intravenous analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated early to promote joint mobility and prevent complications like stiffness or contractures.

Over the next few days, the patient's vital signs remained stable. He gradually started weight-bearing exercises with the assistance of a physical therapist. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, including sequential compression devices and anticoagulant medications, was implemented to prevent blood clots.

The patient's incision site displayed appropriate healing, and no signs of infection were observed. He was instructed on wound care and infection prevention strategies to follow at home.

On the fifth day after surgery, the patient developed a fever and an elevated white blood cell count. A wound infection was suspected, and a wound culture was obtained. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics pending culture results.

The wound culture revealed the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), confirming a surgical site infection. Antibiotic therapy was adjusted according to sensitivity results. The patient's fever gradually subsided, and there were no systemic signs of infection.

During the hospital stay, the patient experienced some episodes of mild respiratory distress, likely due to his underlying COPD. Appropriate measures, including bronchodilators and supplemental oxygen, were taken to manage these episodes effectively.

His renal function remained stable postoperatively, with no signs of acute renal failure. Adequate hydration and close monitoring of renal parameters were maintained throughout the hospital stay.

As part of the discharge planning, the patient was educated on the importance of continuing physical therapy, pain management, and wound care at home. He was prescribed a course of oral antibiotics to complete the treatment of the surgical site infection.

During the follow-up visit two weeks after surgery, the wound appeared well healed, and there were no signs of infection recurrence. The patient reported improved knee function and reduced pain. Physical therapy was continued to further enhance joint mobility and strength.

In summary, the patient with a significant medical history underwent successful knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis. He experienced a postoperative complication in the form of a MRSA surgical site infection, which was appropriately managed with antibiotics. There were no acute renal failure complications observed, and the patient had an overall favorable postoperative course.
