The patient has discussed the surgery in detail with their surgeon and anesthesia team, including the risks and benefits. They have provided informed consent for the procedure.

A plan has been made to optimize the patient's medical conditions before surgery, including ensuring blood pressure is well controlled, glycemic control is optimized, and lipid levels are within the target range.

During the postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely for any complications. They received appropriate pain management and were mobilized as per the surgical team's recommendations.

The patient did not develop any immediate postoperative complications such as wound infection, pneumonia, or deep vein thrombosis. They were able to tolerate a regular diet and were mobilizing well.
