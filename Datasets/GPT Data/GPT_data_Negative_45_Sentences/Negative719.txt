Preoperatively, the patient was evaluated by the surgeon and deemed fit for surgery. Necessary preoperative tests such as X, X, and X were performed and reviewed. The patient was consented for the procedure, and the risks and benefits were explained.

During the procedure, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and monitored closely. The surgical team successfully completed the surgery without any immediate complications. The duration of the operation was X hours.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room for monitoring. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were closely monitored. Pain control was achieved using X medications. The patient was kept NPO (nothing by mouth) initially and gradually advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. Wound healing was monitored, and dressing changes were performed as necessary. Postoperative pain was adequately managed with X medications. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and no signs of infection or bleeding were observed. The surgical team provided adequate postoperative instructions to the patient regarding wound care, activity level, and taking prescribed medications.
