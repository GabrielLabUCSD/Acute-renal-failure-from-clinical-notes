The patient is a 56-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has a long-standing history of smoking and drinks alcohol socially. Currently, he is on medications for his hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, which are well-controlled.

In the past, the patient has undergone a cholecystectomy due to gallstone disease, and an appendectomy due to acute appendicitis. He had an uneventful recovery from both surgeries. There were no complications noted, and he was discharged home after a short hospital stay.

The patient has a family history of heart disease, as his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Therefore, he underwent a cardiac evaluation prior to surgery, which included an echocardiogram and a stress test. The results were normal, and he was cleared for surgery by the cardiologist.

Lab work performed prior to surgery revealed normal renal function with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests, complete blood count, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. He was not on any medications that could potentially influence surgical outcomes.

During his preoperative consultation, the patient was educated about the surgical procedure, including its risks and benefits. The surgeon explained the potential complications associated with surgery, such as wound infection, bleeding, and hernia recurrence. The patient indicated understanding and provided informed consent.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital fasting as per instructions. An IV line was placed, and he was administered prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure. The surgery lasted approximately two hours, and no intraoperative complications were encountered. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the recovery room.

Postoperatively, the patient was initially managed with intravenous pain medications for pain control. He was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and to ambulate as tolerated to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis. His vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any complications. He reported satisfactory pain control and was transitioned to oral pain medications as his pain improved. His incision site was regularly inspected for signs of infection, and appropriate wound care was provided to ensure proper healing.

On the second postoperative day, the patient was able to tolerate a regular diet and had normal bowel movements. The surgical team deemed him ready for discharge. He was provided with detailed postoperative instructions, including wound care, pain management, and activity restrictions. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for one week after discharge.

During the follow-up visit, the patient's surgical incision was healing well with no signs of infection. He reported minimal pain and had resumed his normal activities of daily living. The surgeon was pleased with the outcome of the surgery and confirmed no signs of hernia recurrence. Routine laboratory tests, including renal function, were ordered to ensure that the patient's overall health was maintained postoperatively.

In summary, the patient, a 56-year-old male, underwent successful surgery for hernia repair. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are well-controlled with medication. He has a history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy without any complications. Preoperative evaluation revealed normal cardiac function, and his lab work showed no renal impairment. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He reported satisfactory pain control, resumed regular diet and activities, and had no signs of wound infection. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to ensure his continued recovery.
