Patient is a 55-year-old male who has been experiencing worsening knee pain for the past several years. He has tried conservative management with physical therapy, analgesics, and knee braces, but his symptoms have persisted and significantly affected his quality of life. The patient has a past medical history significant for osteoarthritis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

He undergoes a preoperative evaluation and is found to be generally healthy, with stable vital signs and no evidence of infection or other contraindications to surgery. Laboratory tests reveal no abnormalities. The patient is informed about potential risks, benefits, and alternatives of knee surgery and provides informed consent.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrives fasting, and appropriate preoperative medications are administered. Anesthesia is induced, and the patient is taken to the operating room promptly. A standard knee arthroscopy is performed, during which the surgeon identifies degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. The joint is thoroughly irrigated, and any loose bodies are removed. The procedure is completed without any complications, and the patient is safely extubated and transferred to the recovery room.

During the postoperative course, the patient is closely monitored for pain, wound healing, and early mobilization. Pain management is achieved with a combination of oral analgesics and intravenous narcotics as needed. The patient receives physical therapy to promote early range of motion and muscle strengthening exercises. He is mobilized with the assistance of a walker on the same day as surgery.

In the days following surgery, the patient's pain gradually subsides, and he is able to tolerate ambulation without significant discomfort. His knee incisions heal well without signs of infection, and there is no evidence of persistent joint swelling or effusion. Physical therapy continues, focusing on increasing his range of motion and strengthening the surrounding muscles.

The patient is discharged on postoperative day three with a prescription for oral pain medications and a referral for outpatient physical therapy. Instructions are provided regarding wound care, weight-bearing status, and exercises to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

In the weeks following surgery, the patient continues his physical therapy and gradually increases his tolerance for weight-bearing activities. He is able to achieve near-normal range of motion, significantly improving his knee function and decreasing pain. The patient reports being satisfied with the outcomes of the surgery and expresses gratitude for the improved quality of life.

Throughout the postoperative period, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or implant failure. His blood pressure and lipid profile remain stable, and his chronic medical conditions are managed appropriately following surgery. The patient is scheduled for routine follow-up visits with the orthopedic surgeon to monitor his progress and ensure long-term success of the procedure.

In summary, this patient underwent knee surgery for management of osteoarthritis. The procedure was performed without complications, and the patient had a smooth postoperative course. He achieved improved pain control, range of motion, and functionality of the knee. The patient is currently engaged in physical therapy and is expected to make a full recovery.
