The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He has a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and a previous myocardial infarction. The patient is an active smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history. He states that he has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath with minimal exertion and occasional chest pain. He has no history of allergies or previous surgeries.

Upon further evaluation, the patient was found to have severe mitral valve regurgitation and an echocardiogram revealed left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 35%. The patient was recommended to undergo mitral valve repair surgery to alleviate his symptoms. Preoperative evaluation showed normal renal function with a creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min.

The patient underwent successful mitral valve repair surgery without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he was followed closely in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours. He was initially on mechanical ventilation, but was later weaned off successfully and extubated. Hemodynamics remained stable throughout his ICU stay.

On postoperative day 3, the patient complained of worsening shortness of breath and was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation on telemetry. He was promptly started on anticoagulation and rate control medications and closely monitored. An echocardiogram demonstrated moderate left atrial enlargement with preserved left ventricular systolic function. His symptoms improved gradually and he was eventually converted back to sinus rhythm.

The patient's postoperative course was otherwise unremarkable. He was transitioned to the general ward on postoperative day 5 and gradually started on a cardiac rehabilitation program. His chest pain and shortness of breath resolved, and he was able to resume his daily activities with minimal limitations.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics and aggressive deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections and thromboembolic events. He was discharged home on postoperative day 9 with a prescription for anticoagulation therapy and close follow-up with his cardiology team.

In summary, the patient underwent mitral valve repair surgery for severe mitral valve regurgitation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. He experienced a postoperative complication of new-onset atrial fibrillation, which was successfully managed. The patient's renal function remained stable throughout the hospitalization, without any evidence of acute renal failure.
