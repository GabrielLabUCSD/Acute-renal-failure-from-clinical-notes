This patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medications, statins, and oral hypoglycemic agents to manage his conditions. His blood pressure has been well controlled, with his last recorded measurement being 120/80 mmHg. His cholesterol levels have also been within target range, and his HbA1c levels have been around 6.5%.

The patient has been experiencing chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis, which has significantly affected his mobility and quality of life. Conservative management options, including physical therapy and NSAIDs, have been unsuccessful in providing long-term relief. After extensive evaluation, the patient has decided to proceed with surgical intervention, specifically a total knee replacement.

Preoperatively, his blood work, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, was within normal limits. His renal function tests were notable for mild chronic kidney disease, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 mL/min/1.73m2 and a baseline creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. However, the patient does not have a history of acute renal failure.

The patient was advised to discontinue his oral hypoglycemic agents on the day of surgery, substituting them with sliding scale insulin as needed to maintain glucose control. Instructions were also given for preoperative bowel preparation, and the patient was reminded to remain NPO after midnight.

The surgery was performed without complications, and the patient was extubated smoothly in the post-anesthesia care unit. He was then transferred to the surgical ward, where he received adequate postoperative pain control through patient-controlled analgesia. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to start early mobilization.

During the postoperative course, the patient's vital signs remained stable. He had appropriate wound healing without any signs of infection. His postoperative pain was well-managed, and he reported being able to perform active range-of-motion exercises comfortably. Nursing staff ensured adequate deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with scheduled subcutaneous heparin injections.

The patient became fully weight-bearing with the assistance of a walker on the second postoperative day. He demonstrated good compliance with physical therapy, which involved muscle strengthening and gait training. His knee range of motion gradually improved, and he achieved 90 degrees of flexion by the fourth postoperative week.

There were no immediate postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient's blood glucose levels were adequately controlled with sliding scale insulin. He did not experience any hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episodes during his hospital stay.

Given the patient's stable postoperative course, he was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with appropriate discharge instructions. These instructions included wound care, medication reconciliation, and scheduling follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon. He was provided with a prescription for pain medication and was instructed to continue physical therapy as an outpatient.

The patient was counseled on postoperative precautions and was instructed to refrain from driving until cleared by his orthopedic surgeon. He was also advised to continue using his walker until further guidance and to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next six to eight weeks.

At the one-month follow-up visit, the patient demonstrated further improvement in his knee range of motion with 120 degrees of flexion achieved. He reported minimal pain that was well-controlled with over-the-counter analgesics. The surgical site appeared to be healing nicely, with no signs of infection. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and felt his quality of life had significantly improved.

In conclusion, this patient with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent an uneventful total knee replacement surgery. His postoperative course was satisfactory, with adequate pain control, early mobilization, and successful physical therapy. He did not experience any complications related to the surgery, and his wound healed appropriately without signs of infection. The patient demonstrated improved knee range of motion, minimal pain, and expressed overall satisfaction with the surgical outcome.
