He reports a history of smoking for thirty years but quit ten years ago. He denies any respiratory symptoms or chronic lung disease.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's cardiac status was assessed. He underwent a stress test that revealed a normal exercise capacity without any evidence of myocardial ischemia. Echocardiography demonstrated preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and no valvular abnormalities.

The patient's pulmonary function tests were within normal limits, suggesting good respiratory function without any signs of chronic lung disease.

Laboratory investigations revealed no abnormalities in liver function, renal function, complete blood count, or coagulation profile.

His family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father and a brother; both had myocardial infarctions in their late fifties.

As for his postoperative course, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He was closely monitored for the first 24 hours after surgery, during which vital signs remained stable. He was started on pain management with intravenous opioids and transitioned to oral analgesics as per standard protocol.

Mobility and ambulation were encouraged early on, and the patient responded well, gradually regaining his strength and range of motion. He showed good compliance with physical therapy and demonstrated steady progress in his postoperative exercises.

The patient's surgical incision healed without any signs of infection or wound complications. Appropriate sterile techniques were implemented during the procedure, reducing the risk of infection.

He received prophylactic antibiotics as per guidelines, minimizing the chances of postoperative wound infections.

Daily monitoring of the patient's postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements indicated adequate pain control. He reported minimal discomfort and a pain level of 2/10 throughout his recovery.

The patient's bowel function returned to normal within the expected time frame. He passed flatus and resumed a regular diet without any gastrointestinal symptoms.

He was carefully monitored for postoperative complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The patient was prescribed sequential compression devices and prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin to minimize this risk.

Routine laboratory tests during the postoperative period showed stable renal function, with no signs of acute kidney injury or electrolyte imbalances.

A chest X-ray performed on postoperative day 2 showed satisfactory lung expansion without any signs of consolidation or effusion.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the postoperative period. He did not experience any cardiac events or arrhythmias.

The surgical team closely monitored wound healing, ensuring that there were no signs of dehiscence, hematoma, or seroma formation.

No ventilatory support was required, and the patient had good oxygenation throughout his recovery.

On postoperative day 5, the patient was ambulating independently and had minimal pain. He expressed satisfaction with his surgical outcome and was eager to return to his normal activities.

During his follow-up appointment one month after surgery, the patient reported a complete resolution of surgical site pain and overall improvement in his quality of life.

In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has well-controlled medical conditions and has successfully undergone surgery in the past without complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, with no reported complications such as wound infections, cardiovascular events, or respiratory issues. The patient's pain was managed effectively, and his recovery was characterized by a return to normal bowel function and good wound healing. His renal function remained stable, and no other postoperative complications, including acute kidney injury, were identified. The patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and demonstrated a positive response to postoperative rehabilitation and physical therapy.
