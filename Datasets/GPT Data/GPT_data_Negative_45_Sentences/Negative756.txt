The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 who is scheduled for elective surgery. His medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction five years ago, which was managed medically. He has been on aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and metformin for these conditions. The patient also has a history of mild obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine during the night. He reports good compliance with his medications and CPAP usage.

In terms of family history, his father had a history of coronary artery disease and underwent coronary bypass surgery in his late 60s. The patient's mother has a history of hypertension and is currently managed medically. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or recreational drug use.

On physical examination, the patient's blood pressure is consistently around 130/80 mmHg, and heart sounds are regular with no murmurs or extra sounds. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender with no organomegaly. His peripheral pulses are palpable and symmetric bilaterally. His laboratory results show a fasting blood glucose of 120 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 6.8%, indicating fair glycemic control.

The patient's preoperative workup includes an electrocardiogram (ECG), which shows sinus rhythm with no significant ST segment changes or Q waves. An echocardiogram reveals preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and no regional wall motion abnormalities. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 75 ml/min/1.73mÂ², indicating mild to moderate renal impairment. His liver function tests and coagulation profile are within normal limits.

In preparation for surgery, the patient is advised to continue his home medications, including aspirin, up until the day of the procedure. He is instructed to discontinue metformin 48 hours before surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis. The patient is also advised to avoid eating or drinking after midnight the night before surgery to minimize the risk of aspiration during anesthesia.

Following surgery, the patient has an uneventful postoperative course. He receives perioperative antibiotics as prophylaxis and is closely monitored in the recovery room. The patient is started on low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and is encouraged early mobilization. He is transitioned to a regular diet after regaining bowel function and is counseled on wound care and activity restrictions.

Over the next few days, the patient's vital signs remain stable, and he reports minimal pain, which is effectively managed with analgesics. Repeat blood glucose measurements reveal levels within the target range. The patient's ambulation gradually improves, and he meets the criteria for discharge on postoperative day five.

During the postoperative period, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. However, on postoperative day three, he develops acute delirium, likely multifactorial in etiology. The delirium is managed with nonpharmacological interventions, including orientation and reorientation techniques, provision of a calm environment, and adequate pain control. The patient's mental status improves within a few days, and he no longer exhibits signs of delirium.

In summary, this 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a remote myocardial infarction underwent elective surgery without any major complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day five. The patient's acute delirium was successfully managed, indicating a favorable outcome overall.
