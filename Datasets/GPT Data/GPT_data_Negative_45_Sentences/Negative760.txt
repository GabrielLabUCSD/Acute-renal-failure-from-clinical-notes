The patient is a 65-year-old male, Mr. Smith, who is planning to undergo abdominal surgery. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin, respectively. Other notable medical history includes obesity, osteoarthritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). His previous surgeries include appendectomy and cholecystectomy.

Mr. Smith's blood pressure is well-controlled on lisinopril, with an average reading of 130/80 mmHg. His lipid profile shows slightly elevated cholesterol levels, which are managed effectively with atorvastatin. HbA1c levels indicate fair glycemic control of his diabetes with metformin.

In terms of his surgical risk, Mr. Smith is overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 32.5. He reports occasional shortness of breath on exertion but denies any history of cardiac events or respiratory diseases. Spirometry reveals no evidence of airflow limitation. He is deemed fit for surgery, with no contraindications identified.

During the preoperative evaluation, Mr. Smith's cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with no murmurs or extra heart sounds. Lung auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, and there are no signs of peripheral edema or jugular venous distention. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, likely related to his previous cholecystectomy scar.

Laboratory investigations reveal no significant abnormalities. His renal function tests, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), are within normal limits, ruling out any pre-existing renal impairment.

In the postoperative period, Mr. Smith experiences an uneventful recovery. He is managed with intravenous fluids and given postoperative analgesia to control pain. Vital signs are closely monitored, and he is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. His oral antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antidiabetic medications are resumed within the first 24 hours after surgery.

Mr. Smith's surgical wound site is closely observed, and appropriate dressing is applied to promote healing. He is provided with instructions on wound care and signs of infection to monitor at home. His pain is well-controlled, with no signs of infection or wound complication noted during follow-up visits.

The patient is encouraged to continue his regular exercise routine and adhere to a healthy diet to manage his comorbidities effectively. Referral to a dietician for weight management support is considered, with an emphasis on portion control and reducing calorie intake.

At the one-month follow-up appointment, Mr. Smith reports an uncomplicated recovery period. His blood pressure remains well-controlled, and his lipid profile shows improved levels with atorvastatin. HbA1c levels are stable, indicating continued glycemic control with metformin.

In summary, Mr. Smith, a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, underwent abdominal surgery without complications. His surgical risk assessment revealed no contraindications, and his preoperative evaluations, including renal function, were normal. Postoperatively, he recovered well, with appropriate wound care and pain management. Long-term management focuses on lifestyle modifications, including exercise and diet control, to optimize his overall health.
