Patient S is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been on antihypertensive medication and metformin for the past 10 years, with good control of his blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Over the past year, Patient S has been experiencing worsening knee pain and mobility limitations due to osteoarthritis, which has prompted him to consider surgery as an option for alleviating his symptoms.

During the preoperative evaluation, Patient S's vital signs were stable, and his physical examination revealed tenderness and crepitus in his bilateral knees, with no signs of infection. His blood work, including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, was within normal limits. An electrocardiogram was performed, showing normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia.

Patient S met with an orthopedic surgeon, who recommended a total knee replacement surgery for both knees due to significant degenerative changes observed on X-rays. The patient was counseled about the potential benefits and risks of surgery, which include infection, blood clots, and reactive pain. He consented to the procedure and made the necessary preparations for admission.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and intraoperatively, no complications were encountered. Both knees received appropriate prosthetic replacements, and there were no issues with anesthesia or infection control. Patient S tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery.

During the postoperative period, Patient S was closely monitored for pain control, wound healing, and signs of infection. He received appropriate antibiotics prophylaxis and was started on a regimen of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain management. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote mobility and prevent joint stiffness.

In the first few days following surgery, Patient S experienced some mild pain and swelling, which gradually improved with the prescribed pain medication and physical therapy sessions. His vital signs remained stable, and his incisions appeared to be healing well, with no signs of infection or wound dehiscence.

By the end of postoperative week one, Patient S had made substantial progress in his recovery. He had started to walk with the assistance of a walker and had minimal pain during movement. His appetite had improved, and he experienced no postoperative complications, such as excessive bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, or pneumonia.

Over the next few weeks, Patient S continued his physical therapy regimen and gradually regained strength and range of motion in his knees. He transitioned from using a walker to a cane and was able to perform basic activities of daily living independently. The patient's pain level decreased significantly, allowing him to gradually reduce his pain medication dosage.

At the six-week postoperative follow-up, Patient S demonstrated excellent progress. His incisions were well-healed, and he had no signs of infection or wound-related issues. His knee flexibility and strength had notably improved, and he reported minimal pain during activities such as walking or climbing stairs. The patient was advised to continue with a home exercise program and scheduled for a follow-up appointment in three months.

In summary, Patient S underwent bilateral total knee replacement surgery to address his osteoarthritis-related symptoms. The surgery was uneventful, with no intraoperative complications. During the postoperative period, Patient S experienced mild pain and swelling, which resolved gradually with pain medication and physical therapy. He had an uncomplicated recovery, with no signs of infection, excessive bleeding, or other complications. Patient S showed excellent progress in his mobility and pain control, and he was expected to continue gaining strength and functional ability during his ongoing rehabilitation program.
