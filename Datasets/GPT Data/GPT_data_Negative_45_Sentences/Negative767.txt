The patient is a 58-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. He has been on antihypertensive medications for several years and his blood pressure is well controlled. His diabetes has been managed with lifestyle modifications and metformin, with stable hemoglobin A1c levels. He has a past surgical history of appendectomy and cholecystectomy without any complications.

The patient's current medications include lisinopril 10 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily, and atorvastatin 20 mg daily. He does not have any known allergies to medications. He denies any history of tobacco or alcohol use. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a body mass index (BMI) of 32.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished male in no acute distress. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, heart rate is 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He has no significant abnormalities on cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, or neurological examination.

Laboratory tests show a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 6.8%, total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 110 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 150 mg/dL. His renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient is scheduled for surgery to address a non-emergent condition; the specific type of surgery is yet to be determined. Preoperative evaluations, including electrocardiogram and chest X-ray, are within normal limits. The patient has been educated on the surgical procedure, postoperative expectations, and potential risks and complications. He has provided informed consent for the surgery.

In preparation for surgery, the patient is advised to discontinue the use of metformin for 48 hours prior to the procedure due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Alternative measures will be taken to maintain glycemic control during this period. He is also instructed to continue taking his other medications on the day of surgery with small sips of water.

The surgical procedure is performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient is monitored closely throughout the surgery and vital signs remain stable. The estimated blood loss is minimal, and no transfusions are required. The patient is extubated at the end of the procedure and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's pain is managed with intravenous opioids. He is given prophylactic antibiotics according to surgical guidelines. Early mobilization is encouraged to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with adequate pain control and stable vital signs. He is transitioned to oral pain medications within 24 hours. Regular wound care is provided, and there are no signs of infection or delayed healing. His bowel function returns to normal within the expected timeframe. 

The patient is monitored for any signs of surgical site complications, such as wound dehiscence or hematoma formation, but none are observed. He is closely supervised for any signs of cardiovascular or respiratory compromise, but his recovery is smooth.

The patient is discharged on postoperative day 3 with appropriate postoperative instructions and pain medication prescriptions. He is advised to gradually increase his activity level, consume a diet low in saturated fats and simple sugars to control his diabetes and dyslipidemia, and continue his antihypertensive and statin medications as prescribed. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 2 weeks after discharge to monitor his progress.

In summary, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, who underwent surgery for a non-emergent condition. The surgical procedure was performed without complications, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. There were no signs of wound infection, cardiovascular or respiratory compromise, or delayed wound healing. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 and provided with appropriate postoperative instructions. A follow-up appointment was scheduled to monitor his recovery.
