The patient, a 55-year-old male, presented with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. They were scheduled to undergo surgery for the removal of a benign tumor from their right kidney. Preoperative laboratory tests showed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. The patient was not on any medications that needed to be stopped prior to surgery.

On physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished with a body mass index in the normal range. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rhythm and no murmurs, and lung examination was unremarkable. The patient had normal peripheral pulses and no edema. Their abdomen was soft with no tenderness or masses palpable. Renal function tests showed serum creatinine within the normal range.

The patient had previously undergone a cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones without any major complications. They reported no known drug allergies. Family history was significant for hypertension, but there was no history of thromboembolic events or bleeding disorders.

In the past, the patient had been prescribed metformin for glycemic control but had discontinued it on their own. Their most recent hemoglobin A1c was within the target range. They were advised to restart metformin postoperatively as glycemic control was well maintained with lifestyle modifications alone.

The surgical team planned to perform a minimally invasive laparoscopic procedure for the tumor removal. The patient was educated about the surgical procedure, potential risks, and expected postoperative course.

During the surgery, the procedure went smoothly, and the tumor was successfully removed without any complications. Adequate hemostasis was achieved, and no blood transfusions were required. The patient tolerated the anesthesia well and was stable throughout the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery room. Vital signs remained stable, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Analgesics were administered to manage any pain or discomfort. The patient was encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

Following surgery, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. They did not develop any wound infections or other surgical site complications. No signs of postoperative bleeding or hematoma formation were noted. Bowel function returned, and the patient tolerated a regular diet. Oral pain medication was transitioned to as-needed basis as the patient's pain improved.

The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively, with serum creatinine levels within the normal range. Their blood pressure was monitored closely, and antihypertensive medications were adjusted as necessary to maintain blood pressure control.

No complications, such as surgical site infections, wound dehiscence, urinary retention, or deep vein thrombosis, were observed during the postoperative period. The patient was discharged home five days after surgery, with instructions for wound care, activity restrictions, and medication management, including restarting metformin for glycemic control.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled with the urology and primary care teams to monitor the patient's recovery and address any concerns. The patient was advised to continue regular exercise, maintain a healthy diet, and monitor blood pressure and blood glucose levels closely.

In conclusion, the patient successfully underwent surgery for the removal of a benign tumor from their right kidney. Their postoperative course was unremarkable with no major complications observed. The surgical team managed the patient's medical conditions effectively, and appropriate postoperative care was provided to ensure optimal recovery.
