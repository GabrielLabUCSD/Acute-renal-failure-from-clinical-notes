The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for an appendectomy. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, controlled with medication. The patient denies any allergies to medications and has no known drug interactions. He denies smoking history but admits to consuming alcohol occasionally. Currently, he is not on any blood thinners or anticoagulant therapy.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has never undergone any surgeries previously. He has been experiencing right lower quadrant abdominal pain for the past two days, associated with nausea and vomiting. Initial workup including physical examination and imaging studies showed signs consistent with acute appendicitis, leading to the decision for surgical intervention.

Laboratory results from preoperative blood work indicate normal liver function tests, renal function, and electrolyte levels. His CBC shows a WBC count of 12,000/mmÂ³, with an elevated neutrophil count. Coagulation studies reveal a prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) within normal limits. The patient has consented for blood transfusion if needed during the surgery.

The patient's vital signs are within normal range and stable during the preoperative period. The anesthesia consult confirmed he is a candidate for general anesthesia. He has been instructed to have nothing to eat or drink after midnight on the day of the surgery, in accordance with the fasting guidelines.

The patient's surgery was performed without complications by the surgical team. The appendectomy was completed via a laparoscopic approach. The procedure lasted approximately 45 minutes, and the appendix was successfully removed. The patient tolerated the surgery well, and no adverse events occurred during the anesthesia administration or intubation process.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and monitored closely. He received intravenous fluids and analgesics to manage pain. Vital signs were stable, and the patient was able to ambulate within a few hours of the surgery. His pain was well controlled with oral pain medications, and he reported no nausea or vomiting.

The patient's incisions were clean, dry, and intact during routine wound checks. No signs of infection, erythema, or discharge were observed. He began a clear liquid diet the day after surgery and was advanced to regular meals as tolerated. Bowel function returned, and the patient passed gas on the first postoperative day. The patient's analgesic requirement decreased gradually, and within three days, he was able to transition to over-the-counter pain medications.

There were no immediate postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, or infection. The patient did not experience any urinary retention or complications related to anesthesia either. His postoperative course was unremarkable, and the surgical team was pleased with his progress.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day four with appropriate discharge instructions, including wound care, activity restrictions, and medication management. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician within two weeks for a routine postoperative visit. The patient was given a surgical follow-up appointment for suture removal and further assessment of healing.

In conclusion, the patient successfully underwent an appendectomy without complications. His postoperative course was smooth, and he recovered well. No acute renal failure or other major complications were reported. The patient's adherence to postoperative instructions and follow-up appointments will be essential for monitoring his recovery and ensuring optimal outcomes.
