The patient is a 56-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an undiagnosed abdominal condition. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure is controlled with lisinopril and amlodipine, and his lipid levels are managed with atorvastatin. He takes metformin and glipizide to control his blood sugar levels, which are generally well-managed.

The patient denies any known drug allergies and reports no prior surgical interventions. He does not smoke but has a history of social alcohol use. He lives with his wife, and his occupation involves light physical activity. He follows a regular exercise regimen and reports no current symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. His general appearance is consistent with a well-nourished middle-aged man. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender with no palpable masses or organomegaly. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused with no peripheral edema.

Laboratory investigations show hemoglobin within the reference range, and his renal function is normal with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 90 mL/min/1.73 mÂ². Liver function tests and coagulation profile are within normal limits as well. His fasting blood sugar levels are within the target range with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%.

The patient underwent preoperative testing, including an electrocardiogram, which revealed normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes. Following consultation with a cardiologist, it was determined that no further cardiac evaluation was necessary.

During the procedure, the patient was placed under general anesthesia, and a midline abdominal incision was made for exploration. Intraoperatively, the surgeons discovered a perforated diverticulum in the colon, leading to localized peritonitis. The area was extensively irrigated, and a primary repair of the diverticulum was performed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for close monitoring.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient received intravenous fluids, analgesia, and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. He was closely monitored for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count. His pain was well-controlled with a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he showed steady improvement. He was encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications such as deep venous thrombosis. His appetite gradually returned, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any gastrointestinal issues. Bowel function resumed within the expected timeframe.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was discharged home with oral pain medications and instructions for wound care. He was advised to contact his surgeon if he experienced any signs of infection, increased pain, or any concerns. He was also scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks.

There were no significant complications during the patient's postoperative course. He did not exhibit any signs of wound infection, pneumonia, or other surgical site-related issues. His renal function remained stable throughout the period, with no signs of acute kidney injury. The patient reported overall satisfaction with the surgical outcome and expressed gratitude for the care provided by the medical team.
