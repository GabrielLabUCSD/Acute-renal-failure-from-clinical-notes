The patient is a 67-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled with the use of ACE inhibitors, and his cholesterol levels are within normal limits with statin therapy. His diabetes is well managed with oral hypoglycemic medications.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had undergone a cholecystectomy about five years ago for gallstones. The procedure was uneventful, and he had a smooth postoperative recovery. There were no complications noted during that time.

The patient has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit approximately ten years ago. He denies any history of chronic lung disease or shortness of breath. He reports occasional alcohol use, limited to social occasions, and denies any history of substance abuse.

Investigations reveal that the patient's preoperative laboratory findings are within normal limits, including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and liver function tests. His coagulation profile, including PT and INR, are normal, suggesting no bleeding diathesis.

The patient's preoperative chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were also normal, indicating no underlying respiratory or cardiovascular abnormalities. His cardiologist has given clearance for surgery based on a recent stress test and echocardiogram, which were both normal.

During the surgery, the patient's vital signs were stable, and the procedure was uneventful. He received general anesthesia without any complications. The surgical team notes that the hernia repair was successful, and there were no intraoperative complications.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was monitored in the recovery room. He was initially kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and received IV fluids for hydration. His pain was managed with intravenous opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as tolerated. He underwent routine postoperative laboratory tests, including complete blood count and electrolyte panel, which remained within normal limits.

The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he tolerated a gradual transition from IV to oral pain medications. His surgical wound was inspected daily and showed appropriate healing with no signs of infection. The patient's mobility improved steadily, and he was able to ambulate with assistance within the first 24 hours after surgery.

He was discharged home on postoperative day three with instructions to continue his home pain medication regimen, as well as a short course of prophylactic antibiotics. The surgeon provided the patient with clear discharge instructions and reiterated the importance of wound care and follow-up appointments.

The patient was seen for a follow-up visit one week after surgery. At this time, his surgical wound was healing well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. He reported minimal pain, which was well controlled with over-the-counter pain relievers. The patient demonstrated good functional recovery and was able to perform his activities of daily living without significant difficulty.

During the follow-up visit, the surgeon discussed the final pathology report, which showed no evidence of malignancy or other significant findings. The patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome and reported feeling overall well. He was advised to continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor his wound healing and ensure no long-term complications arise.

In summary, this patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes underwent an uneventful hernia repair surgery. His preoperative investigations were normal, and his postoperative course was uncomplicated. The patient had good pain control, appropriate wound healing, and improved mobility. He was discharged home with detailed instructions and followed up one week later, demonstrating satisfactory recovery without any complications.
