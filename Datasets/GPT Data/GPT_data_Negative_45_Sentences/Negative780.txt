The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a fractured hip. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and mild chronic kidney disease stage 3. The patient has been managed with medications for his hypertension, including lisinopril and amlodipine. He takes metformin and gliclazide for his diabetes, and his blood sugar levels have been well controlled. He had a recent echocardiogram which showed normal cardiac function. The patient reports a history of smoking but quit a year ago and has no respiratory symptoms.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of osteoarthritis with joint pain and stiffness. He has been taking acetaminophen as needed for pain relief. The patient's renal function has been stable with no episodes of acute renal failure. His most recent serum creatinine level was 1.5 mg/dL, which is consistent with his baseline. There is no evidence of proteinuria or hematuria on urine analysis.

The patient has been seen by the orthopedic surgeon and is a suitable candidate for surgery. Preoperative investigations, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and chest X-ray, have been done and were within normal limits. The patient has been advised to discontinue his antiplatelet medication, aspirin, one week before surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and monitored closely for pain, vital signs, and any signs of complications. He received intravenous fluids and was started on prophylactic antibiotics. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and leg exercises to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild to moderate pain, which was managed with opioid analgesics. He was started on low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not develop any signs of infection or wound complications.

The patient was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist on the first postoperative day. He required the use of a walker for support. The patient continued to receive physical therapy throughout his hospital stay to improve mobility and strength.

The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively. His serum creatinine level was monitored daily, and no significant changes were noted. He maintained good glycemic control with his usual diabetes medications. The patient's blood pressure was well controlled with the continuation of lisinopril and amlodipine.

During his hospital stay, the patient received regular wound care to ensure proper healing of his surgical incision. The wound remained clean, dry, and without signs of infection. The patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with instructions for self-care, wound care, and pain management.

At the one-week follow-up appointment, the patient's surgical incision appeared to be healing well without any signs of infection or wound dehiscence. The patient reported minimal pain, which was managed with acetaminophen. He was encouraged to continue physical therapy to improve his mobility and function.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no major complications observed. He had no episodes of acute renal failure. The patient's chronic conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and mild chronic kidney disease, were well managed throughout the surgical and postoperative period. The patient was advised to continue his regular medications and follow up with his primary care physician for further evaluation and management of his chronic conditions.
