Patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for repair of inguinal hernia. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He does not have a history of tobacco or alcohol use. The patient presents with complaints of recurrent groin pain and swelling, suggestive of an incarcerated hernia.

He has been on regular medications including metoprolol for blood pressure control, atorvastatin for cholesterol management, and metformin for diabetes control. His blood pressure is well-controlled with stable readings around 130/80 mmHg. His last HbA1c level was 6.8%, indicating reasonably good glycemic control.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He reports no history of any prior surgeries or significant medical interventions. He denies any recent infections or hospitalizations. His family history is unremarkable, with no notable surgical complications among immediate family members.

On physical examination, the patient is well-nourished and in no acute distress. Vital signs are stable. Auscultation of the heart and lungs reveals no abnormalities. Abdominal examination reveals a reducible right inguinal hernia measuring approximately 4 cm in size. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction or strangulation.

Baseline laboratory investigations including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile are within normal limits. His renal function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient underwent preoperative counseling and his surgical risks were discussed. He was deemed to be a suitable candidate for elective hernia repair. The surgery is scheduled to take place in the next week and the patient has been advised regarding NPO (nothing by mouth) status prior to the procedure. He has been instructed to discontinue his metformin the day before surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis.

The patient was admitted on the day of surgery and all necessary preoperative preparations were completed. He received appropriate perioperative prophylactic antibiotics. The surgery went well, and the patient tolerated the procedure without any complications. The hernia was successfully reduced and repaired using a mesh.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely in the recovery area. Vital signs remained stable and pain was managed with both oral and intravenous pain medications. He was encouraged to ambulate soon after regaining consciousness. Diet was advanced gradually, starting with clear liquids and progressing to a regular diet as tolerated.

The patient's wound was assessed for any signs of infection or hematoma formation. Dressings were changed regularly, and there were no signs of wound dehiscence or imminent complications. He was discharged home on postoperative day one with appropriate counseling and pain management instructions.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled for wound evaluation and stitch removal in one week. The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the next four to six weeks. He was educated about signs and symptoms of infection and given clear instructions on when to seek medical attention.

His postoperative course was uneventful, with no significant complications noted. The patient did not experience any postoperative fever, wound breakdown, or other surgical site-related issues. He reported improvement in his previous symptoms of pain and swelling, indicating successful hernia repair.

In summary, a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent successful elective inguinal hernia repair. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he had no complications. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with appropriate wound care instructions.
