The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with severe osteoarthritis of the left hip. He has been experiencing debilitating pain, decreased range of motion, and difficulty with activities of daily living. Non-surgical management options such as physical therapy and pain medications have been unsuccessful in relieving his symptoms.

The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has been managed with lisinopril and atorvastatin, and his blood pressure and cholesterol levels are currently well-controlled. His body mass index (BMI) is 32, indicating obesity.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative assessment. He was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team consisting of an orthopedic surgeon, an internist, and an anesthesiologist. He underwent a thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to assess his overall health and identify any potential risk factors or contraindications for surgery.

His laboratory work was unremarkable, showing normal complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and kidney function tests. His renal function, specifically, was within normal limits, and he did not have a history of any kidney-related issues or chronic kidney disease. He did not require any further renal evaluation beyond routine preoperative laboratory testing.

Imaging studies, including X-rays and an MRI, confirmed severe degenerative changes in his left hip joint. The cartilage was significantly eroded, resulting in bone-on-bone contact. These findings supported the need for surgical intervention in the form of a total hip replacement.

The patient was educated about the surgical procedure, its benefits, risks, and expected postoperative course. His questions and concerns were addressed, and he provided informed consent for the surgery.

The patient was scheduled for a left total hip replacement under general anesthesia. Preoperative fasting guidelines were followed, and he received appropriate prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the risk of surgical site infection.

The surgery was performed without any complications. The orthopedic surgeon successfully implanted a prosthetic hip joint, replacing the damaged joint surfaces. The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained stable throughout.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was initially monitored in the recovery room before being transferred to the orthopedic surgical ward for further care. He was closely observed for signs of postoperative complications, such as infection, deep vein thrombosis, or excessive bleeding.

Pain management was initiated using a multimodal approach, including oral analgesics, epidural anesthesia, and patient-controlled analgesia. Physical therapy was also started early to improve mobility, muscle strength, and range of motion.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and showed gradual improvement in pain control, mobility, and functional abilities with each passing day. He was able to perform activities of daily living independently and ambulate with the assistance of a walker.

Routine blood tests were performed during his hospital stay to monitor his overall health, including renal function. His kidney function remained within normal limits, and he did not develop any complications related to renal dysfunction.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with appropriate pain medications, activity restrictions, and follow-up instructions. He was advised to continue his blood pressure and cholesterol medications as prescribed and follow a healthy diet and exercise regimen to support his overall well-being.

During his first postoperative visit, the patient reported satisfactory pain control, improved mobility, and increased functional abilities. The surgical wound was healing well without signs of infection or delayed healing. He was encouraged to continue with physical therapy and gradually increase his activity level as tolerated.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and assess long-term outcomes of the surgery, such as implant stability and functionality. The patient was counseled about potential complications that could arise in the future, including prosthetic joint infection, dislocation, or mechanical failure.

In summary, the patient is a 58-year-old male with severe left hip osteoarthritis who underwent a successful left total hip replacement. He had a known medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Preoperative evaluations did not reveal any kidney-related issues or abnormalities. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He experienced improvement in pain control, mobility, and functional abilities. There were no complications related to renal dysfunction, and his kidney function remained within normal limits. The patient was discharged home with appropriate instructions for continued care and follow-up appointments to monitor his progress.
