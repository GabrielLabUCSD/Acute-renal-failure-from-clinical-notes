The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presents to the clinic with worsening knee pain due to osteoarthritis on the right knee. Conservative management including physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections has been attempted, but the patient's symptoms remain uncontrolled.

The decision for surgical intervention has been made, and the patient is scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery. Preoperative evaluations, including laboratory tests and radiographic studies, have been completed, and the patient's surgical risk is deemed acceptable.

Her diabetes is well-controlled with metformin and lifestyle modifications. She has no history of diabetic neuropathy or retinopathy. Blood pressure is under control with a combination of lisinopril and amlodipine. Lipid profile is within normal limits on atorvastatin therapy.

Her surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago due to symptomatic cholelithiasis. No complications were noted during that surgery or postoperative course. The patient tolerated the anesthesia well and had an uneventful recovery.

The patient denies any known drug allergies. Socially, she is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally.

Upon physical examination, the patient presents with right knee joint effusion, decreased range of motion, crepitus, and tenderness on palpation. There are no signs of infection or neurovascular compromise. The opposite left knee shows mild osteoarthritis but is mostly asymptomatic.

The patient is aware of the benefits and risks of total knee replacement surgery. The goals of the surgery are to alleviate pain, improve function, and enhance quality of life. The expected postoperative course involves a hospital stay of approximately 3-5 days, followed by outpatient rehabilitation.

The patient has been counseled on the typical postoperative precautions, including the use of mechanical prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis prevention, early mobilization, and physical therapy.

She has been instructed to discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelet agents seven days prior to surgery. The patient will be admitted the day before surgery for preoperative preparation, including instructions to take nothing by mouth after midnight.

The patient's family has been informed about the surgical procedure and they are supportive of her decision. Home arrangements have been made to ensure a safe and comfortable recovery, including the presence of a caregiver and necessary equipment such as a walker and raised toilet seat.

The patient's postoperative care and pain management plan will involve assessments of vital signs, monitoring for signs of infection or deep vein thrombosis, early ambulation, and the use of patient-controlled analgesia with opioids initially.

The patient has been educated regarding the management of her diabetes during the perioperative period, including glucose monitoring and adjustments in diabetic medications as needed. Close collaboration between the anesthesia team, orthopedic surgeon, and endocrinologist will be maintained to optimize perioperative glycemic control.

The patient understands the importance of deep breathing and incentive spirometry to prevent respiratory complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia. She has been advised to report any signs of infection, excessive pain, or wound complications promptly.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to participate in physical therapy to regain joint mobility, strengthen surrounding muscles, and maximize functional independence. Home exercises and precautions will also be provided to ensure safety and prevent complications.

On postoperative day one, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and she was able to ambulate with the assistance of a physical therapist. Oral analgesics were initiated, and the patient reported acceptable pain control. Wound inspection revealed no signs of infection, and the incision site was healing well.

Throughout her hospital stay, glycemic control was monitored closely, and adjustments in diabetic medications were made. No significant abnormal glucose values were noted, and the patient's diabetes remained well-controlled.

On postoperative day three, the patient was discharged with appropriate wound care instructions, pain medication prescriptions, and a referral for outpatient physical therapy.

The patient attended all scheduled physical therapy sessions, showing progress in range of motion and strength. She reported a decrease in pain and improved functionality with activities of daily living.

At the three-month follow-up visit, the patient reported being satisfied with the surgical outcome. She achieved near-normal range of motion, was able to walk without assistive devices, and resumed her regular activities.

No postoperative complications such as wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism were observed in this patient. Her overall postoperative course and recovery were uneventful.

In conclusion, this patient with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia underwent total knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis. She had an unremarkable postoperative course, achieving satisfactory pain control, wound healing, and physical therapy outcomes. No complications were observed.
