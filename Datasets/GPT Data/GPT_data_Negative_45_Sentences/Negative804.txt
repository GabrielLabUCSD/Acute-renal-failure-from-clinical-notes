The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for an orthopedic procedure. He has a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) four years ago. The patient has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel since then. He also has a history of hypertension, which is well controlled with a combination of amlodipine and lisinopril.

In terms of his surgical history, he has previously undergone a hernia repair surgery without any complications. He does not have any known allergies to medications or latex. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

The patient's preoperative laboratory results are within normal limits, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. His chest X-ray demonstrates no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient is found to have normal cardiac function on an echocardiogram. His ejection fraction is measured at 55%, indicating good cardiac reserve. Additionally, an electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T wave abnormalities.

The patient is scheduled to have surgery under general anesthesia. He requires preoperative clearance from both his cardiologist and primary care physician, which is obtained without any significant concerns. The anesthesiologist plans for standard monitoring during the procedure, including electrocardiogram, blood pressure cuff, pulse oximetry, and capnography.

The patient is informed about the potential risks and benefits of the surgery, including infection, bleeding, and complications related to anesthesia. He signs the informed consent form and expresses understanding and willingness to proceed with the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient is closely monitored in the recovery room before being transferred to the surgical ward. He is initially maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula and is gradually weaned off as his oxygen saturation remains stable. Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, are monitored regularly to detect any changes or abnormalities.

Pain management is carefully addressed postoperatively. The patient is prescribed a combination of oral opioids and non-opioid analgesics to control pain while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. He is also encouraged to participate in early mobilization and physical therapy to aid in his recovery.

Routine laboratory studies, including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, are performed during the postoperative period to assess overall organ function and detect any potential complications. These results remain within normal limits throughout his hospital stay.

The patient is seen by the surgical team regularly for wound checks and to assess the progress of his recovery. His surgical incision is clean, dry, and free of any signs of infection or dehiscence. He is instructed on proper wound care and signs and symptoms of infection to watch for at home.

Nutrition is carefully monitored and optimized to promote healing and prevent complications. The patient is placed on a regular diet as tolerated and receives appropriate supplementation based on his nutritional needs.

The patient is discharged on postoperative day five with appropriate discharge instructions. He is prescribed oral analgesics for pain management and advised to gradually increase his activity level while avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous activities. He is to follow up with the surgical team in two weeks for a wound check.

Following the surgery, the patient does not experience any complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or surgical site bleeding. His recovery is uneventful, and he gradually resumes his daily activities without any issues.

Overall, the patient's surgical course and postoperative period are uncomplicated, with no major adverse events. The patient is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and expresses gratitude for the care provided by the medical team.
