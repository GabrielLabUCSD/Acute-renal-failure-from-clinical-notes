The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. The patient is currently on medications including metoprolol for blood pressure control, metformin for diabetes management, and atorvastatin for cholesterol reduction. His diabetes is well controlled with an HbA1c of 6.5% on his last visit.

His surgical history is notable for a previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease performed six years ago without complications. No other significant surgeries have been performed. The patient has a smoking history of 20 pack-years, but has quit smoking 10 years ago.

In terms of allergies, the patient reports an allergy to codeine, experiencing itching and rash in the past when taking this medication. No other known drug allergies are reported. The patient denies alcohol and recreational drug use.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's vital signs are stable with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m². Auscultation of the heart reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally.

Laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, hepatic function panel, renal panel, and coagulation profile, are within normal limits. The patient has a normal white blood cell count of 7,000/mm³, a hemoglobin level of 14 g/dL, and a platelet count of 200,000/mm³. His liver function tests and coagulation profile are unremarkable, and his renal panel shows normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient is scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the procedure is performed without any complications. The patient receives prophylactic antibiotics, and appropriate surgical techniques are employed in order to minimize the risk of postoperative infection. The surgery lasts approximately 90 minutes, and the patient is stable throughout the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient is taken to the recovery room where he is monitored closely for hemodynamic stability, pain control, and any signs of complications. He is given intravenous fluids to maintain his hydration status and is monitored for adequate urine output. Vital signs remain stable, with blood pressure ranging between 120/70 mmHg and 130/80 mmHg, heart rate between 60 and 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation above 95% on room air.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful, with adequate pain control achieved through the use of intravenous opioids initially, followed by transition to oral analgesics as tolerated. He is instructed to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as pneumonia and blood clots.

No immediate postoperative complications are noted. The patient's incision site is clean and dry, and there are no signs of infection. He tolerates a regular diet and is able to pass gas normally. His bowel movements resume within 48 hours of surgery, indicating proper gastrointestinal motility.

Prior to discharge, the patient receives education on wound care, signs of infection, and when to seek medical attention. He is also provided with clear instructions regarding his postoperative medication regimen, including pain management and resumption of his regular medications.

During the follow-up appointment one week after surgery, the patient reports improved pain control and states that he is healing well. Examination of the surgical site reveals well-approximated incision edges with no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's vital signs remain stable, and laboratory workup reveals no abnormalities.

In summary, this 55-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity has successfully undergone hernia repair surgery without complications. His postoperative course has been uneventful, with adequate pain control and normal wound healing observed. The patient is expected to continue his recovery at home and follow up with his healthcare provider as scheduled.
