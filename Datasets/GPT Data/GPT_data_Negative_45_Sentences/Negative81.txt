The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both well-controlled on medications. He has a BMI of 30 and no known drug allergies. The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. 

Regarding the surgical procedure, the patient is undergoing a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. He has been experiencing episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past six months, and recent imaging confirmed the presence of gallstones. The surgical team has discussed the procedure, its potential risks, benefits, and alternatives, and the patient has given informed consent. 

Preoperative laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. The patient's chest X-ray showed no abnormalities. An EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes. A pre-anesthetic assessment was performed, and the patient was deemed to be in suitable health for surgery, with an ASA score of II. 

In terms of medications, the patient takes metformin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide for his diabetes and hypertension management. He has been instructed to discontinue the metformin on the morning of surgery and resume it upon discharge, and to continue the other medications as prescribed. 

On the day of the procedure, the patient arrived at the hospital and was taken to the operating room. General anesthesia was administered, and the surgeon performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy successfully. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition. 

In the PACU, the patient's vital signs were monitored closely. He received appropriate pain management and fluid resuscitation as needed. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and cough to prevent postoperative complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis. 

During the postoperative course, the patient's pain was controlled with oral analgesics, and his incisions were monitored for signs of infection or dehiscence. He was started on a clear liquid diet and gradually advanced to a regular diet. The patient's bowel movements returned on postoperative day 2, indicating normal gastrointestinal function. 

In terms of complications, the patient did not experience any significant intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. However, on postoperative day 3, the patient developed a surgical site infection with erythema, warmth, and purulent drainage from one of the trocar sites. He was started on oral antibiotics and had the wound debrided and dressed. The infection resolved with appropriate management, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5. 

At discharge, the patient was provided with instructions for wound care, antibiotic course, and follow-up appointments. He was advised to gradually increase his activity level and avoid heavy lifting for the next few weeks. The patient was also educated on signs and symptoms of potential complications such as bile leak or postcholecystectomy syndrome and instructed to seek medical attention if they occur. A postoperative follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks to assess wound healing and ensure complete recovery.
