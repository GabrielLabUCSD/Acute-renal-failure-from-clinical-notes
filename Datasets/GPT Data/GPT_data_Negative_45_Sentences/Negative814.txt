The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications for the last five years and reports good blood pressure control.

Regarding his hyperlipidemia, he has been taking a statin medication for the past ten years, which has effectively lowered his cholesterol levels. The patient is well-controlled and regularly monitors his blood lipids.

In terms of his diabetes, he was diagnosed five years ago and has been managing it with diet modifications, regular exercise, and oral hypoglycemic agents. His most recent hemoglobin A1C was 6.5%, indicating good glucose control.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed ten years ago for symptomatic gallstones. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient had an uncomplicated recovery.

He has no known drug allergies and is not on any medications apart from those previously mentioned. He does not smoke, but he consumes alcohol occasionally.

On physical examination, the patient appears well with no acute distress. His vital signs are stable, and his body mass index is within the normal range. Auscultation of the heart and lungs reveals no abnormalities. His abdomen is protuberant with a visible hernia and no signs of inflammation or tenderness.

Preoperative laboratory investigations were conducted, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation profile, liver function tests, and an electrocardiogram. All results were within normal limits, indicating no significant organ dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances.

The patient was seen by the anesthesiologist, who deemed him suitable for general anesthesia. The anesthesia team plans to employ endotracheal intubation and subsequent mechanical ventilation during the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the recovery room for any signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia. He will receive appropriate pain management, including both analgesic medications and instructions for non-pharmacological pain relief methods.

The patient will be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and respiratory complications. He will also receive postoperative instructions regarding wound care, limitations on physical activity, and any necessary dietary modifications.

To assess the patient's recovery, postoperative follow-up visits have been scheduled. During these visits, wound healing will be assessed, and any complications will be identified and managed appropriately. The patient will also undergo periodic laboratory testing to monitor his glucose, lipid, and blood pressure levels.

In terms of postoperative complications, the patient did encounter some mild wound infection at the surgical site, which was managed conservatively with antibiotics and wound care. His postoperative course was otherwise unremarkable, and he was discharged home on the fourth day after surgery with appropriate instructions.

To prevent acute renal failure, structured hydration protocols were followed intraoperatively, and careful monitoring of fluid balance was performed postoperatively.

In summary, this 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is planning to undergo hernia repair surgery. He has a favorable past surgical history without any complications. Preoperative investigations are unremarkable, indicating good organ function. Postoperatively, he will be closely monitored for complications and receive appropriate pain management. The patient had a mild wound infection but otherwise had an uneventful recovery. He will undergo further follow-up visits to ensure proper wound healing and to monitor his underlying medical conditions. Acute renal failure was not observed as a complication due to the meticulous care provided.
