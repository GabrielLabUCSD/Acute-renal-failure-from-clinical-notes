The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His blood pressure is well controlled on Lisinopril 10 mg daily. His diabetes is managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily and his lipid profile is well controlled with atorvastatin 20 mg daily. There is no known drug allergy in the patient's history.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy back in 2001 and a hernia repair surgery in 2010, both of which were uneventful. He has not had any previous major complications related to surgery.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient is deemed to be a good candidate for surgery based on his overall health status and laboratory parameters. His complete blood count shows a normal hemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dL, no leukocytosis, and a platelet count of 220,000/mcL.

His renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ². The patient is well-hydrated, and there is no evidence of dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities.

The patient's cardiac workup reveals an unremarkable electrocardiogram (ECG) with a sinus rhythm and no significant ST-T wave changes. His echocardiogram shows a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with no valvular abnormalities or regional wall motion abnormalities. He is deemed to have adequate cardiovascular fitness for surgery.

Pulmonary function tests demonstrate a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.5 L (95% predicted) and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 2.8 L (90% predicted). These results indicate normal lung function and no significant obstructive or restrictive patterns.

The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 28, which falls within the overweight range. He does not have a significant smoking history and denies any current or prior tobacco use. There is no evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other significant respiratory conditions.

The patient's blood glucose levels are well controlled with an average fasting blood glucose of 110 mg/dL and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.2%. He is advised to continue his regular diabetic medications up until the day of surgery and to monitor his glucose levels closely during the perioperative period.

Additionally, the patient is reviewed by the anesthesiologist and is cleared for surgery under general anesthesia with no anticipated difficulties related to airway management. He does not have a history of postoperative nausea or vomiting and has never required prophylactic antiemetic treatment.

Stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is not deemed necessary in this patient due to the absence of significant risk factors such as a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, multiple trauma, or other major risk factors.

The patient is scheduled for surgery and is admitted to the hospital the day before the procedure. He undergoes a standard preoperative fasting period and is administered preoperative antibiotics according to the surgical site infection prevention guidelines.

The surgical procedure goes smoothly, lasting approximately two hours. The patient is hemodynamically stable throughout the surgery, with no significant intraoperative complications noted. The estimated blood loss is minimal, and no blood transfusion is required.

Postoperatively, the patient is transferred to the recovery room and monitored closely for potential complications. He is awake and responsive, with stable vital signs. Pain control is achieved with intravenous (IV) opioids as needed.

The patient is encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and atelectasis. He receives DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and wears sequential compression devices on his lower extremities.

His postoperative course remains uneventful, with no signs of wound infection, respiratory distress, or other immediate complications. Cardiac monitoring shows a normal sinus rhythm, and his blood pressure remains within the target range.

The patient's pain is adequately controlled with a combination of oral and intravenous analgesics. He is able to tolerate a regular diet and maintain good oral intake, with no signs of postoperative nausea or vomiting.

On the first postoperative day, the patient is evaluated by physical therapy to facilitate early mobilization and prevent postoperative muscle weakness. He is encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer regularly to maintain optimal lung function.

The patient's recovery progresses well, and he is discharged home on the third postoperative day with appropriate postoperative instructions. He is advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a routine postoperative visit.

There were no immediate postoperative complications experienced by the patient. However, on the fifth postoperative day, the patient develops a surgical site infection at the incision site. He presents with increased redness, warmth, and tenderness around the wound.

The patient is evaluated by his primary care physician and started on a course of oral antibiotics. Daily wound care with saline irrigation and sterile dressing changes is performed. The patient is instructed to monitor the wound closely for any signs of worsening infection.

Over the course of several weeks, the surgical site infection slowly resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy and wound care. The patient maintains good glycemic control throughout this period and demonstrates no signs of systemic infection.

At his two-week postoperative visit, the patient's wound is healing well with no signs of residual infection. His pain is well-controlled with oral analgesics, and he reports improved functionality and quality of life compared to before the surgery.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He undergoes surgery without immediate complications and is discharged home on the third postoperative day. He subsequently develops a surgical site infection on the fifth postoperative day, which is managed with oral antibiotics and appropriate wound care. The infection resolves, and at the two-week postoperative visit, the patient is healing well with improved pain control and overall recovery.
