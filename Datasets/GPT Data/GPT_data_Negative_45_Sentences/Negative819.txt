The patient's vital signs remained stable, and she did not experience any fever or signs of infection. Her incision site was inspected regularly for signs of dehiscence or infection, with no abnormalities noted.

The patient's pain was well-managed, and she reported improvement in her knee pain compared to preoperative levels. Physical therapy was initiated to facilitate her recovery and return to functional activities.

The patient's blood sugars were monitored closely, and her diabetes management continued during her stay in the hospital. Insulin sliding scale was utilized as needed to maintain her blood glucose levels within the target range.

The patient's renal function remained stable postoperatively with no significant changes in her serum creatinine or eGFR. She remained adequately hydrated throughout her hospital stay.

No postoperative complications were encountered during the patient's hospitalization. She did not experience any wound infections, pneumonia, or thromboembolic events.

The patient's pain was well-controlled with oral analgesics as she transitioned from intravenous pain medications. She was educated on pain management strategies to continue at home.
