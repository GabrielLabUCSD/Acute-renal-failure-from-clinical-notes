The patient, a 52-year-old male, has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been taking antihypertensive medications, statins, and oral hypoglycemic agents for these conditions for the past five years. He denies any history of smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use.

The patient's surgical procedure is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past six months. The pain is of moderate intensity and is not relieved by over-the-counter medications. A thorough evaluation revealed gallstones on abdominal ultrasound and a decision was made to proceed with surgery.

In preparation for the surgery, the patient has undergone routine preoperative investigations, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. The results of these investigations were within normal limits, with no significant abnormalities noted. He has been advised to stop taking his oral hypoglycemic agents on the morning of surgery. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels have been well controlled leading up to the procedure.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived in a fasting state and was administered general anesthesia without any complications. The laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed successfully, with the surgeon removing the gallbladder and the gallstones through small incisions. The procedure went smoothly and the patient tolerated it well. No major bleeding or intraoperative complications were noted.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the recovery room for monitoring. His vital signs remained stable, and he regained full consciousness within an hour. He reported minimal pain at the incision sites, which was effectively managed with oral analgesics. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and deep breathe to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

Over the next few days, the patient's condition continued to improve steadily. He was able to tolerate a regular oral diet without experiencing any nausea or vomiting. The surgical wounds were clean and dry, with no signs of infection. The patient's pain was well controlled, allowing him to mobilize independently. He was discharged home on the third postoperative day with appropriate postoperative instructions and a prescription for a short course of oral antibiotics.

During the follow-up visit at two weeks post-surgery, the patient reported feeling overall much better and had returned to his usual daily activities. His surgical wounds had healed well without any signs of infection or dehiscence. He had no complaints of pain or discomfort. The patient was advised to continue his antihypertensive medications and statins, but his oral hypoglycemic agents were discontinued as his blood glucose levels had returned to normal range.

In summary, this patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. He had a smooth recovery with minimal postoperative pain and was discharged home on the third day post-surgery. The patient had no complications during his postoperative course.
