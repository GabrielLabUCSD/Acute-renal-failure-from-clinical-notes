The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with chronic knee pain and decided to undergo surgery. His medical history reveals hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. The patient has been on regular antihypertensive medications, including lisinopril, for the past five years. He has been managing his diabetes with metformin and has achieved adequate glycemic control. Lipid-lowering therapy, consisting of atorvastatin, has been effective in maintaining his lipid profile within normal limits. Despite these interventions, his weight has remained elevated, with a body mass index of 32.

In preparation for surgery, the patient has undergone routine preoperative investigations, including blood work, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. These investigations revealed well-controlled blood pressure, stable glycemic control, and no evidence of cardiac abnormalities. However, his lipid profile exhibited borderline high levels, necessitating a slight dosage adjustment of atorvastatin.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient was thoroughly evaluated by an anesthesiologist and deemed fit for surgery. His airway examination revealed no anatomical abnormalities, and his lungs were clear on auscultation. The patient reported no significant respiratory symptoms, such as cough or difficulty breathing. His cardiac examination was unremarkable, with regular heart sounds and no murmurs. Additionally, the patient had no history of deep venous thrombosis or thromboembolic events.

The surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated the surgery well. The surgical team noted no intraoperative complications, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery area for any signs of pain, bleeding, or surgical site infection. He was administered appropriate pain management to ensure his comfort.

The patient's postoperative course was smooth, with no immediate complications observed. He was encouraged to perform early mobilization and participate in physical therapy to prevent postoperative complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or joint stiffness. The nursing staff closely monitored his blood pressure, ensuring it remained within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose levels were also monitored regularly to maintain glycemic control during his hospital stay.

During his hospitalization, the patient developed a minor wound infection at the surgical site. The infection was promptly identified and treated with antibiotics, leading to resolution without any further complications. The patient's pain was effectively managed, allowing him to engage in postoperative rehabilitation exercises. Overall, the patient's recovery was satisfactory, and he was discharged from the hospital within the expected timeframe.

In conclusion, this middle-aged man with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity underwent surgery for chronic knee pain. The patient's preoperative evaluation revealed well-controlled blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes, with slightly elevated lipid profiles. The surgery proceeded uneventfully under general anesthesia, and the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, with appropriate pain management and early mobilization. Although a minor wound infection occurred, it was resolved successfully with antibiotics. The patient was discharged in stable condition, and further follow-up will be conducted to monitor his progress.
