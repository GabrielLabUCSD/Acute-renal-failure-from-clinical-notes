The patient is a 55-year-old male who has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He has a significant medical history, which includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is currently taking medications for both conditions and they are well controlled. The patient also has a family history of cardiovascular disease. He underwent a prostatectomy two years ago and has been cancer-free since then. He recently developed urinary symptoms, and a biopsy confirmed the recurrence of prostate cancer. The patient has been advised to undergo a radical prostatectomy.

In preparation for surgery, the patient underwent a preoperative evaluation. His physical examination was unremarkable, except for an enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, including a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. His renal function was also normal, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient was cleared by the anesthesiology team for surgery. He was advised to stop taking any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, and herbal supplements two weeks before the procedure. He was also advised to maintain fasting status from midnight the night before surgery.

The patient underwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The procedure was performed without any complications. The surgeon was able to remove the entire prostate gland, and the surgical margins were negative for cancer. The estimated blood loss during the procedure was minimal.

Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery. He was started on oral pain medications, and his pain was well controlled. He was started on a clear liquid diet and advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. His urinary catheter was removed on postoperative day one, and he was able to void without difficulty. The patient was encouraged to perform regular deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications. He was discharged home on postoperative day two.

During the postoperative period, the patient did not experience any complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or urinary retention. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he followed up with his surgeon for a pathology report and further management of his prostate cancer. The pathology report confirmed the complete removal of the cancerous tissue, and the patient was referred for adjuvant radiation therapy to lower the risk of cancer recurrence.

In summary, the patient with a history of prostate cancer successfully underwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. He had an uneventful recovery with no postoperative complications. The pathology report showed negative surgical margins, and he was recommended for adjuvant radiation therapy. The patient will continue to be closely monitored for any signs of cancer recurrence and will receive long-term follow-up care.
