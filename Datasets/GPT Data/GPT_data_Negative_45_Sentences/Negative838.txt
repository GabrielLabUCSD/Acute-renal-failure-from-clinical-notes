The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He presents with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. He has been on antihypertensive medications for five years, statins for four years, and metformin for three years.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone an appendectomy 15 years ago without any complications. He is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse. The patient's family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father, who underwent coronary bypass surgery at the age of 65.

On physical examination, his vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. His BMI is 28, suggesting he is overweight. The patient's abdomen shows an obvious bulge consistent with an inguinal hernia, with no signs of redness, tenderness, or skin changes.

Laboratory tests reveal well-controlled blood glucose levels, HbA1c of 6.5%, and normal lipid profile. His renal function tests are within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 ml/min/1.73m2.

The preoperative assessment also includes an electrocardiogram, which reveals a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemic changes. The patient's chest x-ray demonstrates clear lung fields and no evidence of cardiomegaly or pulmonary pathology.

He has been counselled regarding the procedure, risks, and benefits of surgery, including the potential for general anesthesia. Informed written consent has been obtained. The patient has been instructed to discontinue antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin, seven days prior to surgery.

The patient underwent an uneventful hernia repair surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the surgeon encountered a small inguinal hernia with minimal tissue damage. The hernia was successfully repaired using a mesh, and no complications were encountered.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery unit. He experienced mild postoperative pain, which was managed with analgesics. His vital signs remained stable, with a blood pressure ranging between 120-130/70-80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70-80 beats per minute. He was able to tolerate oral fluids and was encouraged to ambulate.

The patient was observed for any signs of postoperative complications, including wound infection, hematoma, or seroma formation. He was educated about proper wound care and signs of possible infection, such as increased redness, warmth, and purulent discharge.

He received prophylactic antibiotics postoperatively and completed a short course of them as prescribed. There were no indications of wound infection or other postoperative complications during his hospital stay.

Before discharge, the patient was re-evaluated by the surgical team and deemed fit for discharge. He was provided with a prescription for oral analgesics to manage any residual pain at home.

The patient was instructed to avoid heavy lifting or straining for at least six weeks postoperatively and to gradually increase physical activity. He was advised to follow a high-fiber diet and maintain good glycemic control to minimize the risk of constipation.

A postoperative follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks post-surgery to assess wound healing and ensure the patient's overall recovery. The surgeon provided him with further instructions on wound care and potential signs of wound complications.

In the postoperative course, the patient's recovery was unremarkable, with complete resolution of pain and no signs of wound infection. He reported good compliance with his medications and continued to monitor his blood pressure and blood glucose levels regularly.

To avoid complications, the patient was advised to maintain optimal control of his chronic medical conditions by adhering to his prescribed medications and following lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet and regular exercise.

In summary, the patient underwent hernia repair surgery without any intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. His recovery was uneventful, with no signs of wound infection or other complications during the hospital stay. He was provided with appropriate postoperative instructions and scheduled for a follow-up appointment to monitor his progress.
