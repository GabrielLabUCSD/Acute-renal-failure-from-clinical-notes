The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a history of hypertension, which has been well-controlled with medication for the past five years. He has also been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2, which is managed with diet and exercise. 

In terms of family history, the patient's father had a history of heart disease and his mother had a history of breast cancer. The patient himself has never had any major surgeries before and has no known allergies to medications or anesthesia. 

In terms of his preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent a thorough physical examination, which revealed no significant abnormalities. His blood work, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, were within normal limits. 

The patient's preoperative chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia or any other pulmonary abnormalities. His electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias. 

In terms of his postoperative course, the patient tolerated the surgery well and woke up from anesthesia without any issues. He was initially started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics to prevent infection. 

The patient's pain was managed with a combination of opioid and non-opioid pain medications. He was encouraged to ambulate and deep breathing exercises were initiated to prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis. 

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay, and he did not develop any signs of infection, such as fever or wound erythema. His surgical incision was clean and dry without any signs of dehiscence or infection. 

As part of his recovery, the patient was provided with detailed instructions regarding wound care and medication management upon discharge. He was also advised to continue his regular medications, including his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. 

The patient was seen for follow-up two weeks after surgery, at which point his surgical wound was healing well. He reported a decrease in pain intensity, and no signs of infection were noted. 

In terms of his postoperative complications, the patient did experience constipation, which was managed with stool softeners and increased fluid intake. 

Additionally, the patient developed a postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left lower extremity. He presented with swelling, pain, and erythema. He was started on anticoagulation therapy and advised on the importance of early ambulation and leg exercises. 

The patient was referred to a hematologist to rule out any underlying hypercoagulable state. He underwent Doppler ultrasound, which confirmed the presence of a DVT. 

The patient was followed closely by the surgery team to monitor his anticoagulation therapy and symptoms. He was also educated on signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and advised to seek immediate medical attention if they occurred. 

Fortunately, the patient did not develop any further complications related to the DVT and was able to discontinue anticoagulation therapy after three months. 

Overall, despite the development of a postoperative complication, the patient had an uneventful recovery from surgery. His preoperative medical conditions were well-managed, and his surgical incision healed without complications. The patient was advised on the importance of regular follow-up appointments and continued management of his chronic medical conditions.
