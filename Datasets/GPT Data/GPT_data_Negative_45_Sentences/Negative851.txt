The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and mild chronic kidney disease. He is scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The patient's preoperative lab work showed a hemoglobin A1c level of 7.2%, indicative of suboptimal glycemic control. He has been taking metformin and lisinopril for his diabetes and hypertension, respectively. The patient has a remote history of a myocardial infarction without any residual cardiac dysfunction. His last echocardiogram, performed six months ago, demonstrated normal left ventricular function.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, and his heart rate was 80 beats per minute. The physical examination was unremarkable, except for mild right upper quadrant tenderness on deep palpation. Chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities, and an EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was deemed suitable for surgery with a moderate surgical risk due to his comorbidities.

The patient was instructed to discontinue metformin prior to surgery and begin a clear liquid diet the day before the procedure. On the morning of surgery, the patient received routine preoperative antibiotics and was placed under general anesthesia. The surgical procedure was uneventful, lasting approximately 90 minutes, with the surgeon finding and removing multiple gallstones without any complications. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

In the postoperative period, the patient was monitored closely for any signs of complications. He experienced normal postoperative pain, which was managed with intravenous opioids initially, followed by oral analgesics. The patient's blood glucose levels were monitored frequently, with sliding scale insulin administered to maintain glycemic control. His blood pressure remained stable, averaging around 130/80 mmHg. The patient was ambulated on the first postoperative day and encouraged to resume a regular diet as tolerated.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's renal function remained stable, with no evidence of acute kidney injury. His urine output was within normal limits, and there were no signs of fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances. The patient's incisions appeared to be healing well with no signs of infection or wound dehiscence. He was discharged home on postoperative day three with appropriate discharge instructions, including wound care, medication reconciliation, and a follow-up appointment in two weeks.

During the first two weeks following surgery, the patient reported a gradual reduction in pain and improved overall well-being. His blood glucose control improved, with the hemoglobin A1c level decreasing to 6.8% during the postoperative period. The patient experienced no postoperative complications, such as surgical site infections, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis. His renal function remained stable, with normal urine output and no signs of renal impairment.

Overall, the patient had a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. His comorbid conditions were well-managed throughout the perioperative period, resulting in a smooth recovery and no issues with wound healing or renal function. The patient was advised to continue managing his diabetes and hypertension appropriately, with medications, regular monitoring, and lifestyle modifications. Further follow-up will be essential to ensure long-term well-being and preventive healthcare management.
