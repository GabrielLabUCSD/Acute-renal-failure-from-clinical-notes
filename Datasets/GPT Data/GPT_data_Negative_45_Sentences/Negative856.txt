The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery three years ago. He takes multiple medications including lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and aspirin.

The patient's blood pressure is usually well controlled with the current antihypertensive regimen. However, his blood glucose levels are not optimally managed, with HbA1c persistently above 8%. He has been counseled regarding the importance of lifestyle modifications and adherence to his diabetes medications.

The patient's lipid profile is within target range on atorvastatin, and there have been no recent significant changes. He reports occasional muscle pains but denies any overt symptoms of myopathy. Regular liver function tests have been performed and are consistently normal.

Due to his history of coronary artery disease, the patient will undergo a scheduled elective surgery to address a nonmalignant gastrointestinal condition. The procedure will require general anesthesia and is estimated to last approximately three hours.

In preparation for surgery, the patient has undergone a preoperative assessment, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram. His laboratory results are all within the normal range, indicating stable renal and hepatic function and no electrolyte imbalances.

The patient does not have a history of chronic kidney disease but was found to have mild albuminuria during routine urine analysis. His estimated glomerular filtration rate is 65 mL/min/1.73 mÂ², suggesting mild renal impairment. This finding did not preclude the planned surgery, and the patient was encouraged to follow up with a nephrologist postoperatively.

During the surgical procedure, there were no major complications. The patient tolerated the general anesthesia well and remained hemodynamically stable throughout. The surgical team noted minimal blood loss and no intraoperative complications.

Following surgery, the patient was transferred to the postoperative recovery unit for close monitoring. His vital signs remained stable, and he did not require any significant interventions. Intravenous fluids were administered to maintain fluid balance, and the patient was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's pain was managed with intravenous opioids, and he was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent complications such as atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's glucose levels were closely monitored, and insulin therapy was initiated to maintain glycemic control.

The patient recovered well from surgery and was discharged on the third postoperative day without any complications. He was provided with instructions for wound care, pain management, and medication reconciliation. Additionally, he was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for a routine postoperative visit.

At the routine postoperative visit, the patient reported minimal pain and no signs of surgical site infection or wound complications. His blood pressure was within target range, and there were no concerning changes in his laboratory results.

In terms of his diabetes management, the patient was educated on the importance of adherence to medications and blood glucose monitoring. He was also referred to a diabetes educator for further counseling on lifestyle modifications and proper insulin administration.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no acute complications. His renal function remained stable, and there were no signs of acute renal failure. The patient was advised to continue with his regular follow-up appointments to monitor his chronic conditions and adjust his medications as necessary.
