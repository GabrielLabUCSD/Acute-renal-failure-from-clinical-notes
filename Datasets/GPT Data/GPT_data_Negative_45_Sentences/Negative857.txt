The patient is a middle-aged individual who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. They have been on regular medications for these conditions, including amlodipine for blood pressure control, metformin for blood sugar regulation, and atorvastatin for cholesterol management. The patient also has a history of smoking, with a 10-pack-year smoking history.

Upon evaluation for the planned surgery, the patient underwent a comprehensive preoperative assessment. Blood work revealed a well-controlled blood glucose level with an HbA1c within the target range. However, their lipid panel showed slightly elevated LDL cholesterol levels. The patient had a preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess cardiac function, which was found to be within normal limits.

During the preoperative assessment, the patient mentioned occasional shortness of breath with exertion and reported recurring chest discomfort. As a result, a stress test was performed to evaluate the patient's cardiac function further. The stress test showed signs of inducible ischemia, suggesting possible coronary artery disease (CAD). As a follow-up, the patient underwent a coronary angiography, which confirmed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery.

Based on the findings, the patient was referred to a cardiac surgeon for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The patient was carefully prepared for the procedure, including optimizing their blood pressure and blood sugar control. Due to the patient's smoking history, they were counseled to quit smoking before the surgery to reduce postoperative complications and promote better healing.

On the day of surgery, the patient received general anesthesia, and an arterial line and central venous line were placed for hemodynamic monitoring. The cardiac surgeon performed the CABG procedure successfully, bypassing the stenosed segment of the left anterior descending artery, thus restoring proper blood flow to the heart muscle.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for close monitoring. They were placed on a mechanical ventilator for a short time and were gradually weaned off as their respiratory status improved. Hemodynamic stability was maintained with appropriate medications, and their blood glucose levels were carefully monitored and controlled.

Additionally, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. Analgesics were administered to control postoperative pain. Physical therapy was initiated early to promote ambulation and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful. Routine blood work showed no signs of infection or electrolyte imbalances. Their blood pressure remained stable, and blood sugar levels were carefully managed. The patient was closely monitored for signs of complications such as wound infection, respiratory distress, or neurologic deficits.

The patient's recovery progressed well, and they were successfully weaned off supplemental oxygen. They received instructions for incision care and were advised to continue their regular medications postoperatively. Additionally, smoking cessation counseling and support were provided to prevent relapse.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience complications such as wound infection, respiratory complications, or neurologic deficits during their hospital stay. The surgical incisions appeared to be healing well, without any signs of redness, swelling, or discharge. The patient's pain was adequately controlled, allowing them to mobilize and resume normal activities gradually.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was smooth, with no major complications observed. The interdisciplinary healthcare team closely monitored the patient's progress, ensuring a successful surgery and a smooth recovery. The patient was discharged in stable condition with appropriate follow-up appointments scheduled to monitor their cardiac health and overall well-being.
