The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital with complaints of severe knee pain. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. The knee pain has been progressively worsening over the past year and is severely limiting his mobility. After an extensive evaluation, it was determined that the patient would benefit from total knee replacement surgery.

The patient was thoroughly counseled about the surgical procedure, including the risks and benefits. He was also educated about the expected postoperative course and the importance of rehabilitation. Preoperative investigations were conducted, including laboratory tests, EKG, and radiographs. The laboratory results were within normal limits, and the EKG showed no significant abnormalities.

No preoperative complications were noted, and the patient was deemed suitable for surgery. The patient was scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. The surgical team explained the procedure in detail, addressing the patient's concerns and answering any questions he had.

The surgery was successfully performed without any intraoperative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was closely monitored throughout. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room for further observation and pain management.

In the immediate postoperative course, the patient experienced expected pain and swelling around the surgical site. He was started on a tailored pain management regimen, which included opioid analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient's vital signs remained stable, and there were no signs of infection or wound complications.

Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to aid in the patient's early mobilization. The physical therapist provided guidance on proper techniques for ambulation and assisted the patient with various exercises to promote joint range of motion and muscle strength. The patient was compliant with the rehabilitation program and demonstrated gradual improvement in his ability to walk and perform daily activities.

As the patient continued his recovery, his pain gradually diminished, and his knee function improved. The nursing staff closely monitored his wound for signs of infection and ensured proper wound care. The patient was also assessed for any potential postoperative complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and appropriate prophylactic measures were taken.

During the postoperative course, the patient did not experience any acute renal failure, which is an important complication to monitor in surgical patients. He did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of urinary dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances. Kidney function tests were within normal limits throughout his hospital stay.

On the seventh day after surgery, the patient was discharged home with appropriate pain medications and detailed instructions for home care. He was advised to continue physical therapy as an outpatient and to follow up with his surgeon for wound assessment and further evaluation.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was successful, with steady improvement in pain control and knee function. There were no complications related to the surgery, and the patient was satisfied with the outcome. He was able to regain his mobility and return to his daily activities without significant limitations.
