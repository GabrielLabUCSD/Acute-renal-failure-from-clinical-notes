The patient is a 60-year-old male who presented to our clinic with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was planning to undergo surgery to address his chronic knee pain and limited mobility. His preoperative assessment revealed well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. The patient had been managing his diabetes with diet and exercise, without requiring any oral medications or insulin. He had no past surgical history.

Laboratory investigations showed normal complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were within the target range at 6.5%. He had a chest X-ray that revealed no abnormalities. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

During the surgery, general anesthesia was administered, and a total knee replacement was performed successfully. The patient tolerated the procedure well, without any intraoperative complications. He received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis based on his weight and the duration of the surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and closely monitored for vital signs, pain control, and fluid balance. He was started on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. The patient received patient-controlled analgesia with opioids initially, which was later transitioned to oral analgesics as his pain improved. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to aid in early mobilization.

During his postoperative course, the patient showed good progress. His vital signs remained stable, and his pain was well-controlled. He actively participated in physical therapy sessions and gradually regained mobility of his knee joint. Laboratory monitoring showed no signs of infection or other abnormalities.

The patient experienced no complications such as surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He had appropriate wound healing without any signs of wound dehiscence or delayed wound closure. The patient's glycemic control remained stable during the postoperative period, and his blood pressure was within the target range.

In terms of urinary complications, the patient did not develop acute renal failure or any urinary tract infections. His renal function remained within normal limits throughout his hospital stay. Adequate hydration was maintained during the perioperative period, and measures were taken to protect his kidneys.

In summary, the 60-year-old male patient presented for knee replacement surgery with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. The surgery went well without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient had a smooth recovery, with adequate pain control, early mobilization, and stable vital signs. There were no surgical site infections, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism observed. Additionally, the patient did not experience any urinary complications or acute renal failure during his hospitalization.
