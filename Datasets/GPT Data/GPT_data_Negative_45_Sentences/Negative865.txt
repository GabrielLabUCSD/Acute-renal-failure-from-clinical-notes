The patient is a 45-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. He has been managing his chronic conditions well with medication and lifestyle modifications. The patient is an active smoker, with a 20-year history of smoking one pack per day.

Recently, the patient developed severe arthritis in his right knee, which significantly impacted his ability to stand or walk for a prolonged period. After conservative measures failed to provide relief, he decided to undergo total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation, including laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and an electrocardiogram. His laboratory results were within normal limits, with the exception of mildly elevated cholesterol levels. The chest X-ray showed no signs of any pulmonary abnormalities, and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm.

The patient was seen by the anesthesiologist and deemed appropriate for general anesthesia. Preoperative counseling was given, and the patient was educated about the surgical procedure, risks, benefits, and expected outcomes.

The patient underwent total knee replacement surgery without any intraoperative complications. The procedure was successful, with proper alignment and component positioning. The patient was closely monitored throughout the surgery and experienced stable vital signs.

Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgical unit. He received appropriate pain management with opioid analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to facilitate early mobilization and rehabilitation.

The patient's postoperative course was largely uneventful. He reported mild to moderate pain at the surgical site, which was managed effectively with analgesics. He was able to bear weight and walk with assistance on the second postoperative day.

The patient's vital signs remained stable, with no signs of infection or wound complications. He received prophylactic antibiotics as per protocol and had a dressing change as scheduled. His incision site showed normal healing without signs of erythema, induration, or drainage.

The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored due to his diabetes, and appropriate adjustments to his insulin regimen were made. He experienced mild postoperative hyperglycemia but responded well to insulin therapy.

In terms of postoperative complications, the patient developed a low-grade fever on the third postoperative day. Workup was performed, including blood cultures and a chest X-ray, which ruled out infection or pneumonia. The fever resolved spontaneously without any interventions.

Despite the patient's smoking history, he required minimal respiratory support postoperatively. Spirometry was performed, and he received incentive spirometry instruction to promote lung expansion and prevent postoperative atelectasis.

The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with a comprehensive discharge plan. He was educated about the importance of wound care, pain management, medication compliance, and the need to continue physical therapy at home.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled with the orthopedic surgeon and primary care physician. The patient was advised to continue smoking cessation efforts and to adopt a healthier lifestyle to optimize his long-term outcomes.

Overall, the patient's total knee replacement surgery was successful, and he had an uncomplicated postoperative course aside from the transient low-grade fever. The patient is expected to continue his rehabilitation and achieve significant improvement in his knee joint function.
