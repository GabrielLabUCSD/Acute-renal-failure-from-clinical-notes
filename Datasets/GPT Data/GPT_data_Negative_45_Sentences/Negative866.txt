The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and mild chronic kidney disease. He has been taking lisinopril and metformin for the past five years to manage his conditions. The patient recently learned that he requires surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. He has opted for general anesthesia and is scheduled for surgery in one week.

The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled on his current medication regimen, with his last reading measuring 120/80 mmHg. His diabetes has also been managed effectively with an HbA1c level of 6.5%. Although the patient's renal function is mildly impaired, his creatinine level remains stable at 1.3 mg/dL, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 58 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

During the preoperative assessment, the patient disclosed a history of smoking, but he quit five years ago. He denies any allergies and reports no previous surgical procedures. His current medications are lisinopril for blood pressure control and metformin for diabetes management. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities, except for a visible inguinal hernia on the right side.

Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile, were within normal limits. The patient's electrocardiogram shows no significant abnormalities, and a chest X-ray reveals clear lung fields and a normal-sized heart.

The patient's surgical risk is determined to be low, given his well-controlled blood pressure, stable renal function, and absence of other significant comorbidities. He is advised to continue taking his current medications until the day of surgery, with clear instructions to abstain from food and drink after midnight on the night before the procedure.

On the day of surgery, the patient is taken to the operating room without any complications. The surgery proceeds uneventfully under general anesthesia, and the inguinal hernia repair is successful. The patient is extubated at the end of the procedure and transferred to the recovery room.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is closely monitored for any signs of pain, bleeding, or infection at the surgical site. He is provided with pain medication to manage any discomfort, and he is encouraged to ambulate as tolerated. The surgical wound is clean and well-approximated with no signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's vital signs remain stable throughout the recovery period.

The patient's postoperative course is generally unremarkable, with no complications observed. He is closely monitored for any signs of postoperative complications, such as fever, worsening pain, or abnormal wound drainage. The patient's pain is adequately controlled with oral analgesics, and he is discharged home two days after the surgery.

During the follow-up appointment one week later, the patient reports a satisfactory recovery. The surgical wound has healed well, and there are no signs of infection or complications. The patient's pain has significantly improved, and he is able to return to his regular activities without limitations.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and mild chronic kidney disease. He underwent inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia without any perioperative complications. The postoperative course was uneventful, with no signs of infection or wound complications. The patient's pain was well managed, and he had an excellent recovery.
