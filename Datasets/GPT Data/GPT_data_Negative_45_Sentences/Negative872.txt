This patient is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been on antihypertensive medications, including lisinopril and metoprolol, to manage his blood pressure. He also takes metformin for his diabetes and is on a statin medication for his cholesterol.

In regards to his cardiovascular history, the patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting three years ago to address a significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. Following the PCI, he has been doing well and has remained asymptomatic for angina. He has been following up regularly with his cardiologist for routine check-ups and has had no cardiac events since the procedure.

Regarding his renal history, the patient does not have a previous diagnosis of acute renal failure or chronic kidney disease. His most recent laboratory results have indicated normal renal function with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73m².

The patient's surgical procedure is planned for an elective hernia repair. Prior to the surgery, the patient underwent preoperative assessment, which included a thorough physical examination, blood work, and an electrocardiogram. All preoperative investigations were within normal limits, providing medical clearance for the surgery.

Following the surgery, the patient experienced an unremarkable postoperative course. He was carefully monitored during the immediate postoperative period for any signs of complications. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he achieved pain control with the prescribed analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate early and received prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, such as compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's recovery progressed well. His surgical incision showed no signs of infection, and there were no concerns regarding wound healing. He was able to tolerate an oral diet without any issues and experienced no gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea or vomiting. The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored and managed within target range postoperatively.

As for the patient's renal function, his postoperative laboratory results demonstrated stable kidney function, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an eGFR of 88 mL/min/1.73m². There were no significant fluctuations in his creatinine levels that would suggest acute renal failure.

In summary, this patient has a significant medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He underwent a PCI three years ago and has been asymptomatic since. There is no known history of acute renal failure or chronic kidney disease. The patient has recently undergone an elective hernia repair and had an uneventful postoperative course. He demonstrated stable renal function, as indicated by his laboratory results, and did not experience any complications.
