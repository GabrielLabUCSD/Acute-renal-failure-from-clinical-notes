The patient is a 50-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension that is well controlled with medication. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, which is managed with insulin therapy. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 10 years ago. The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy in his teenage years and underwent a cholecystectomy 5 years ago due to symptomatic gallstones. The cholecystectomy was uneventful with no complications. His previous surgeries were performed under general anesthesia without any issues.

The patient is currently not experiencing any symptoms and denies any significant weight loss or fatigue. His blood pressure is well controlled with a regular systolic blood pressure ranging from 120-130 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure ranging from 70-80 mmHg. His current hemoglobin A1c level is 7.2%, reflecting fair glycemic control. He reports occasional episodes of dizziness but attributes it to orthostatic hypotension. All other laboratory values are within normal limits.

On physical examination, the patient appears in no acute distress. His heart sounds are regular, with no evidence of murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no jugular venous distention is noted. Abdominal exam reveals a well-healed scar from the previous cholecystectomy. There is no tenderness, organomegaly, or masses palpable.

Preoperative workup includes an electrocardiogram (ECG), which reveals a normal sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave abnormalities. An echocardiogram was performed and showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%. Additionally, a preoperative chest x-ray was done and was unremarkable.

The surgeon plans to perform an elective surgery on the patient, and therefore, the patient was advised to discontinue any blood-thinning medications a week prior. He was further instructed to have nothing to eat or drink starting at midnight the night before the surgery. The anesthesiology team will be consulted to assess the patient's fitness for surgery and determine the appropriate anesthesia plan.

The patient underwent surgery without any complications and was managed under general anesthesia. The intraoperative period was uneventful, with stable vitals and no significant intraoperative bleeding. The surgical procedure lasted approximately 2 hours, and the patient tolerated it well.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room, where he received appropriate pain management and was closely monitored for any signs of complications. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout the recovery period, with no signs of hypotension or tachycardia noted.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced mild postoperative pain that was managed with intravenous pain medication. He was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis. A physical therapist provided guidance on proper breathing exercises and early mobilization.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 2. He was given instructions on wound care, activity modifications, and follow-up appointments with both the surgeon and primary care physician. Additionally, the patient was advised to continue his regular diabetic and hypertensive medications.

No postoperative complications were noted during the patient's hospital stay or follow-up visits. The patient's incision healed well without signs of infection or dehiscence. He did not experience any significant bleeding or signs of anemia. Furthermore, the patient did not develop any respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.

In conclusion, this 50-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 underwent an uneventful surgery without any complications. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home with appropriate instructions for recovery and follow-up. No acute renal failure was observed as a complication.
