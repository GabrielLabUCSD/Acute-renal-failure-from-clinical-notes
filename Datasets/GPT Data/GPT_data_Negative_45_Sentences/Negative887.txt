The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for high blood pressure for which he takes lisinopril and metformin for diabetes control. The patient denies any allergies to medications or prior surgical procedures. He has been a non-smoker for the past 10 years and does not consume alcohol regularly.

During preoperative evaluation, his blood pressure was consistently elevated, leading to the adjustment of his lisinopril dosage. Laboratory testing revealed well-controlled blood glucose levels with an HbA1c of 6.2%. Additionally, his renal function was within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

On physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and in overall good health. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular heart sounds with no murmurs or abnormalities noted. Lung examination was unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed an overlying hernia with no signs of incarceration. The patient's surgical risk was deemed low to moderate based on his medical history and overall current health status.

In preparation for surgery, the patient was instructed to fast for eight hours prior to the procedure. He followed preoperative instructions closely and reported to the hospital on the morning of the scheduled surgery. After being admitted, the patient was taken to the operating room and received general anesthesia for the procedure.

During the hernia repair surgery, no complications were encountered, and the procedure was completed successfully. The patient tolerated anesthesia well and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the operation. The surgeon repaired the hernia using mesh reinforcement to provide additional support and reduce the risk of recurrence.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room for signs of pain or complications. He was started on intravenous fluids and controlled analgesia for pain management. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and pain was adequately controlled. Clear liquids were initiated a few hours after surgery, and the patient tolerated them well without any signs of gastrointestinal distress.

On the first postoperative day, the patient began ambulating with assistance from nursing staff to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. His incision site was inspected regularly for signs of infection or wound dehiscence. The patient was encouraged to perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative atelectasis.

Over the following days, the patient's pain continued to decrease, and he gradually transitioned to an oral diet. The surgical wound was healing well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. Although the patient experienced some postoperative nausea, it resolved with antiemetic medication.

The patient's postoperative course was generally uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day. During the discharge process, the patient was provided with oral pain medication for continued pain management at home. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for the first few weeks, ensuring proper healing of the surgical incision.

In the subsequent outpatient follow-up visits, the patient reported a good level of pain control and no signs of surgical site infection. He was advised to continue taking his lisinopril and metformin as prescribed to manage his blood pressure and diabetes. The patient was also encouraged to maintain a healthy diet and engage in regular physical activity to optimize his overall health.

In summary, the patient underwent successful hernia repair surgery without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, he recovered well and was discharged with appropriate pain management. The patient's postoperative course has been unremarkable, with no complications observed so far. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels remained stable throughout the hospital stay, and his wound healing progressed without any issues. The patient is expected to have a smooth recovery and is due for a routine follow-up appointment at the surgical clinic in two weeks' time.
