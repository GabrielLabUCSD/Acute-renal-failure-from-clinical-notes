Patient X is a 56-year-old male with a significant medical history who is scheduled for surgery. He has a long-standing history of hypertension, for which he takes an oral antihypertensive medication. He is also a type 2 diabetic, controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents, and has a history of hyperlipidemia, managed with statin therapy. The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery five years ago due to significant coronary artery disease.

In addition to his cardiac history, the patient has a prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer five years ago. The source of the bleeding was identified as Helicobacter pylori infection, which was successfully treated with antibiotics. The patient has no current symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Patient X also had a previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right lower extremity. He was treated with anticoagulant therapy and has not experienced any recurrent episodes.

Furthermore, the patient reports an intermittent history of obstructive sleep apnea. He has been using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine while sleeping for the past two years with good compliance.

The patient's surgical history includes appendectomy performed during his childhood and a cholecystectomy done ten years ago for symptomatic gallstones. Both surgeries were without complications.

Current medications include lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and a multivitamin supplement. He is not on any anticoagulant therapy at the moment.

In terms of allergies, the patient reports an allergy to penicillin, experiencing a rash when exposed to this medication in the past.

Regarding the surgical procedure, Patient X is scheduled for an elective total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis. Preoperative medical clearance has been obtained from both the cardiologist and pulmonologist, with no significant concerns raised.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He received prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively and had no signs of infection. Pain was managed with a combination of intravenous opioids initially and transitioned to oral analgesics as tolerated. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day, focusing on range of motion exercises and gradual weight-bearing. The patient demonstrated good effort and made steady progress.

Follow-up examinations revealed no immediate complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient's pain gradually decreased, and he was able to achieve satisfactory mobility with the assistance of a walker. He was discharged on postoperative day three with a prescription for oral pain medication and instructions for home physical therapy.

Patient X had an uncomplicated recovery following total knee replacement, with no signs of infection, thromboembolic events, or wound-related complications. He will continue his postoperative rehabilitation program and follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon for regular check-ups.
