The patient's HbA1c level was 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control. A preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and no evidence of cardiac abnormalities.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient was seen by the anesthesiologist. His physical examination revealed no significant findings, and he was deemed to be a suitable candidate for surgery. The anesthesiologist recommended general anesthesia for the procedure.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrived at the hospital and was prepared for the procedure. Anesthesia was induced smoothly, and the surgery lasted approximately two hours. The surgeon reported that the procedure was successful and without any complications.

Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. The nurse monitored his vital signs closely, and he was provided with adequate pain control. The patient reported minimal discomfort and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. He was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and he remained stable throughout the hospital stay. His surgical incision was clean, dry, and intact. Prior to discharge, the nurse provided detailed instructions on wound care, activity restrictions, and medications.

During the follow-up visit with the surgeon two weeks later, the patient's incision had healed well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence. He reported feeling back to his baseline level of functioning and had resumed his regular activities.

Overall, the patient's surgery went smoothly without any complications. He had a prompt recovery and experienced no issues during his postoperative course. The patient was satisfied with the outcome and appreciated the care received from the healthcare team.
