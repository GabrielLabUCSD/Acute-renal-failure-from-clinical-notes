The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been managing his conditions well with regular medication and follow-up appointments.

He is currently on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for his hypertension, a statin for hyperlipidemia, and metformin for his diabetes. His blood pressure and blood glucose levels have been under control with these medications.

The patient also has a history of tobacco use, but he quit smoking five years ago. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. He has a supportive family, and his wife is actively involved in his healthcare decisions.

He underwent routine preoperative evaluations, including laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. His preoperative blood work showed adequately controlled blood glucose levels, normal kidney function, and cholesterol within the recommended range.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He had a history of a surgical procedure three years ago for a ruptured appendix, which was uneventful without any complications.

During the preoperative risk assessment, it was noted that the patient has an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of II, indicating a patient with mild systemic disease. The anesthesia team deemed the patient suitable for surgery under general anesthesia.

The patient was educated about preoperative instructions, including fasting, medication management, and the importance of a thorough surgical site cleansing before the procedure. He was also provided postoperative care instructions and advised to report any adverse events promptly.

The surgery for hernia repair was performed without complications. The patient tolerated the anesthesia well. Intraoperative findings revealed a reducible hernia, which was repaired with synthetic mesh. The duration of surgery was approximately one hour.

Postoperatively, the patient recovered in the surgical ward under close monitoring. Pain was managed adequately with oral analgesics. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications, such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any significant bleeding or wound-related issues. His postoperative laboratory tests showed no abnormalities, including no evidence of acute renal failure.

The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet without any complications. His surgical site was well-healed and showed no signs of infection or dehiscence. The surgical team provided appropriate wound care instructions, including keeping the surgical site clean and dry.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 2, with instructions to continue his regular medications. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for a few weeks to allow for adequate healing.

During the follow-up visit, the patient reported minimal pain and a well-healed surgical site. His blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and cholesterol levels were within the target ranges. The surgical team considered the patient's postoperative course uneventful.

The patient remained compliant with his medication regimen and attended all the scheduled follow-up appointments. He reported no complications, such as wound infection, prolonged pain, or hernia recurrence.

His postoperative recovery continued to be smooth, with gradual improvement in his activity tolerance and energy levels. The patient was encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and smoking cessation.

In summary, the patient with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent an uneventful hernia repair surgery. He had a successful postoperative course without any complications, including acute renal failure. The patient demonstrated good medication adherence and actively participated in his postoperative care.
