Patient X is a 65-year-old male who presented with chronic knee pain and difficulty walking. His past medical history is significant for osteoarthritis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and naproxen.

Patient X's knee pain has progressively worsened over the last year, leading to significant limitations in his daily activities. Conservative management with physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections have not provided adequate relief. His orthopedic surgeon has recommended a total knee replacement surgery to improve his quality of life.

Preoperatively, patient X underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, coagulation profile, and urinalysis. His laboratory results were within normal limits, except for slightly elevated blood glucose levels. His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.2%, indicating fair control of his diabetes.

Patient X was also seen by the anesthesiology team to assess his fitness for surgery. He reported no history of adverse reactions to anesthesia and had a Mallampati class II airway. His cardiac evaluation, including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, revealed no significant abnormalities, and he had good exercise tolerance. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 72 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating mild renal impairment.

The surgical team discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with patient X, including the risk of infection, bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and nerve injury. Patient X understood and consented to the surgery, signing the informed consent document.

Patient X underwent an uneventful total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the surgical team noted severe articular cartilage damage and performed a successful implantation of a prosthetic knee joint. The patient received prophylactic antibiotics and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis perioperatively.

Postoperatively, patient X was closely monitored in the recovery room for adequate pain control and hemodynamic stability. He was placed on a patient-controlled analgesia pump with intravenous opioids for pain management. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization and reduce the risk of complications.

Patient X's postoperative course was generally smooth, with no evidence of wound infection or delayed wound healing. His pain was well controlled, and he demonstrated active participation in physical therapy sessions. He gradually regained knee range of motion and muscle strength and was able to bear weight on the operated leg with the assistance of a walker.

During his hospital stay, patient X experienced no acute complications such as pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction. His blood glucose levels were adequately managed, and his HbA1c remained stable. There were no signs of intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage, and his coagulation parameters remained within normal limits.

Patient X was discharged home on the fifth day postoperatively with a prescription for oral analgesics and a referral for outpatient physical therapy. He was advised to continue his regular medications and monitor his blood glucose levels closely.

In the outpatient setting, patient X continued to make progress with physical therapy, attending sessions twice a week. He reported decreased knee pain and improved mobility at his follow-up visits. His surgical wound healed without complications, and he did not require any additional interventions or readmissions.

Overall, patient X had a successful total knee replacement surgery with a favorable postoperative course and no major complications. His pain management and rehabilitation were effectively addressed, allowing him to regain functionality and improve his overall quality of life. Patient X continues to be monitored closely for long-term outcomes and potential complications as part of routine follow-up care.
