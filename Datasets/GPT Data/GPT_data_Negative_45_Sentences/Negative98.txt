Patient Summary:

This is a 62-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, well-controlled with medication. He has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient has a history of stable angina and was previously treated with a stent placement 5 years ago, which relieved his symptoms. He continues to take antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. Additionally, he has a history of osteoarthritis affecting both knees, and he manages the pain with NSAIDs as needed.

The patient has a significant social history of cigarette smoking, having smoked a pack a day for 30 years. He quit smoking 5 years ago after his stent placement, but his quit attempts prior to that were unsuccessful. He consumes alcohol in moderation, with no history of alcohol abuse. There is no family history of coronary artery disease, but his father had a history of hypertension.

In terms of surgical indication, the patient has been experiencing worsening knee joint pain and mobility limitations due to his osteoarthritis. Despite conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, his symptoms have not improved. He has elected to proceed with total knee replacement surgery to regain his quality of life.

Regarding the patient's postoperative course, the surgery was uneventful, and he tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia. The patient was closely monitored in the recovery room and then transferred to the surgical ward. Adequate pain control was achieved with a combination of opioids and non-opioids. Physical therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day to promote early mobilization and rehabilitation.

During his hospital stay, the patient had no significant complications. He did not develop any wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout his hospitalization, with no signs of infection or respiratory distress. Blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and appropriate adjustments were made to his diabetes medication to maintain glycemic control.

Postoperatively, the patient exhibited satisfactory progress with improving knee range of motion and reduced pain. The physical therapy program proved to be beneficial in helping him regain strength and mobility. The patient's pain was adequately managed with a combination of oral analgesics and physical therapy modalities.

During his follow-up visits, the patient reported a significant improvement in his joint pain and functional status. He was able to perform activities of daily living without significant limitations. The incision site was healing well, with no signs of infection or dehiscence.

In summary, this patient, who underwent a total knee replacement surgery, had a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stable angina, and osteoarthritis. He had no significant postoperative complications and experienced a satisfactory recovery, with an improvement in joint pain and functional status. His diabetes was managed appropriately throughout the postoperative period.
