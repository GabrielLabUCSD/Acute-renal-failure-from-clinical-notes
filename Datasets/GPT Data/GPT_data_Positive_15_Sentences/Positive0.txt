The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery in the coming weeks. He has a complex medical history which includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He currently takes medication to manage his blood pressure and blood sugar levels.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of smoking for over 30 years, which has led to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He experiences occasional shortness of breath, especially during physical activity.

The patient underwent a myocardial infarction two years ago, for which he received coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He has been doing well since the surgery, with no major cardiovascular events or episodes of angina.

Lab tests reveal that the patient has impaired renal function, with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 45 ml/min/1.73m². The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, likely related to his hypertension and diabetes. He has been closely monitoring his kidney function over the years and has been advised to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and certain antibiotics.

Given the patient's medical history, a thorough preoperative evaluation will be necessary to assess his cardiovascular and pulmonary function. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed to check for any cardiac abnormalities. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be conducted to evaluate his lung capacity and identify any potential issues during anesthesia.

After undergoing surgery, the patient experienced an episode of acute renal failure. His creatinine levels increased to 3.5 mg/dL, and his GFR dropped to 25 ml/min/1.73m². His urine output also significantly decreased, indicating a decline in kidney function.

The acute renal failure is likely a result of the surgery, compounded by the patient's pre-existing kidney disease. The surgical procedure may have led to decreased renal blood flow, resulting in ischemia and subsequent kidney injury.

To manage the acute renal failure, the patient will need close monitoring of his kidney function, including regular blood tests to assess creatinine and urine output. Treatment will involve maintaining adequate hydration, possibly with intravenous fluids, and adjusting any medications that may further harm kidney function.

The patient's medical team will closely monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, as imbalances can further affect kidney function. Renal imaging, such as a renal ultrasound or CT scan, may be required to assess for any structural abnormalities or blockages that may contribute to the acute renal failure.

It is important for the patient to understand the seriousness of his acute renal failure and the need for close monitoring and potential interventions. With proper medical management, there is hope for his kidneys to recover and return to their baseline function. However, it will be crucial for the patient to maintain a healthy lifestyle, manage his chronic conditions, and follow any prescribed treatments to prevent further kidney damage in the future.
