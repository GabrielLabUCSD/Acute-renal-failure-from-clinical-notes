The patient is a 60-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently taking medications for these conditions, including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction in his 50s.

The patient is scheduled to undergo surgery for a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. He has been experiencing frequent episodes of abdominal pain, especially after consuming fatty foods. The decision for surgery was made after consulting with a gastroenterologist who reviewed his symptoms and ordered diagnostic tests, including an ultrasound and a CT scan.

Regarding the patient's surgical history, he has previously undergone a right knee arthroscopy to repair a torn meniscus. The procedure went well, and he did not experience any significant complications or infections.

During the pre-operative evaluation, the patient was found to have well-controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Laboratory tests revealed a normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function. His creatinine levels were within the normal range at that time.

Unfortunately, following the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure. This was characterized by a sudden decrease in urine output, increased serum creatinine levels, and metabolic acidosis. The cause of renal failure was determined to be postoperative acute tubular necrosis, which can occur as a result of prolonged hypotension, hypovolemia, or exposure to nephrotoxic agents.

The patient required immediate management in the surgical intensive care unit. Intravenous fluids were administered to correct the fluid imbalance and restore adequate perfusion to the kidneys. In addition, renal replacement therapy in the form of continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated to remove waste products and maintain electrolyte balance.

Throughout the post-operative period, the patient's renal function slowly improved. Hemodialysis was gradually tapered off, and diuretics were used to promote urine output. Serial laboratory tests showed a gradual decrease in serum creatinine levels and improvement in metabolic acidosis. The patient was eventually transferred to a general medical ward for further monitoring and care.

Due to the patient's previous medical history and the development of acute renal failure, his recovery is expected to be prolonged and complicated. Close monitoring of kidney function, electrolyte levels, and fluid balance is essential to prevent further complications and ensure optimal recovery. The patient will also require continued management of his underlying conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, to prevent future complications.
