The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He takes medications to manage these conditions, including lisinopril for blood pressure control and metformin for diabetes.

The patient has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He has never had any previous surgeries and has no known allergies.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. His weight is 180 lbs and height is 5'10".

Laboratory tests reveal a fasting blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. His kidney function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 85 mL/min/1.73m².

The patient has been fully informed about the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the possibility of complications such as bleeding, infection, and post-operative pain. He has given informed consent for the procedure and understands the pre-operative and post-operative instructions.

During the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure as a complication. His urine output decreases, and his serum creatinine level rises significantly to 2.5 mg/dL. His eGFR drops to 40 mL/min/1.73m². He does not experience any other complications during the surgical procedure.

The patient is immediately started on intravenous fluids to support his renal function and stabilize his fluid status. He is closely monitored for any signs of worsening renal function or electrolyte imbalances.

Further investigations are done to determine the cause of the acute renal failure. A renal ultrasound is done, which shows normal kidney size and no signs of obstruction. Blood tests are also performed to check for autoimmune diseases, infections, and drug-induced kidney injury.

The patient's medications, including lisinopril and metformin, are temporarily held due to their potential to worsen renal function. Alternative medications are prescribed to manage his hypertension and blood sugar levels.

The patient's renal function slowly improves over the next few days, with increasing urine output and a gradual decrease in serum creatinine levels. He is closely monitored by a nephrologist throughout his hospital stay.

The patient is eventually discharged from the hospital with improved renal function and stable vital signs. He is advised to follow up with his primary care physician and nephrologist for ongoing monitoring and management of his kidney function.

In conclusion, this patient has a significant medical history and is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He develops acute renal failure as a complication, but with appropriate management and monitoring, his renal function improves over time.
