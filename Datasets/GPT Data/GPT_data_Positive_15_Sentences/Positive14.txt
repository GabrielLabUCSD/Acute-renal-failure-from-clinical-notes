The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 55-year-old male planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. His hypertension has been well-controlled on a combination of antihypertensive medications, including amlodipine and lisinopril. His diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and his last HbA1c was 6.8%. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 35, indicating obesity.

Mr. Smith has undergone various surgeries in the past, including a cholecystectomy and a knee replacement. Both surgeries were uneventful, and he had a smooth recovery. His surgical history also includes a follow-up procedure for incisional hernia repair, which was performed two years ago without complications.

In terms of medications, Mr. Smith takes metformin for his diabetes, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and aspirin for cardiovascular protection. He also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain.

Laboratory investigations show that Mr. Smith has a normal complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, and coagulation profile. His renal function, as indicated by serum creatinine levels, is within normal range. However, he has a mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 28 mg/dL, indicating decreased kidney function.

During the surgery, Mr. Smith develops complications in the form of acute renal failure. His urine output decreases significantly, and his serum creatinine rises to 2.5 mg/dL. He complains of decreased urine output and generalized fatigue. His blood pressure remains stable throughout the episode.

Further investigations reveal that Mr. Smith's acute renal failure is likely due to prerenal causes, such as decreased blood flow to the kidneys. This may be a consequence of intraoperative hypotension or fluid loss during the surgery. He does not have any signs of urinary obstruction or intrinsic renal pathology.

Treatment for Mr. Smith's acute renal failure includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, aimed at restoring his blood volume and improving renal perfusion. He is closely monitored for any signs of fluid overload or worsening kidney function. His medications are adjusted to minimize further renal damage and optimize blood pressure control.

Follow-up investigations show improvement in Mr. Smith's renal function. His serum creatinine levels gradually decline, and his urine output increases. He remains clinically stable and is discharged with close outpatient follow-up to ensure complete resolution of the acute renal failure. Education is provided regarding the importance of maintaining good hydration and avoiding potential nephrotoxic medications.

In conclusion, Mr. Smith, a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, is planning to have surgery. He has previously undergone cholecystectomy, knee replacement, and hernia repair surgeries without complications. His renal function is normal preoperatively, but he develops acute renal failure postoperatively, likely due to prerenal causes. Treatment involves fluid resuscitation and close monitoring, with gradual improvement in renal function observed.
