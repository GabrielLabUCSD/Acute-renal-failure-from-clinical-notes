The patient, a 63-year-old male, has a significant medical history that includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a previous myocardial infarction. He has been on a regimen of metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin to manage these conditions.

The patient has been experiencing worsening symptoms related to his heart disease, including shortness of breath and fatigue. As a result, his cardiologist has recommended surgical intervention to address a blockage in his coronary arteries.

Due to his diabetes, the patient has also been experiencing complications such as peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy. He is regularly monitored by an endocrinologist and ophthalmologist for these conditions.

The patient regularly checks his blood glucose levels and has been maintaining relatively good control with diet and medication. He is aware that perioperative glucose control is crucial in preventing postoperative complications.

As part of the surgical evaluation, the patient underwent several preoperative tests, including an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and chest x-ray. These tests revealed evidence of a prior myocardial infarction and decreased cardiac function.

The surgical procedure will require general anesthesia, and the patient has been advised to refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight the night before the surgery. He has also been instructed to temporarily stop taking his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications prior to the surgery.

Unfortunately, the patient experienced a complication following the surgery in the form of acute renal failure. His postoperative urine output decreased significantly, accompanied by an increase in serum creatinine levels.

He was initially managed conservatively with intravenous fluids, diuretics, and close monitoring. However, when his renal function failed to improve, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.

Consultations with a nephrologist and urologist were obtained to assess for any specific causes of the acute renal failure. It was determined that the patient's renal failure was likely multifactorial, resulting from a combination of decreased renal perfusion and potential nephrotoxic medication exposure during the surgery.

The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance was closely monitored, and he was maintained on continuous renal replacement therapy to assist with the management of his renal function.

Overall, the patient's medical history presents several risk factors and challenges for the surgical team to consider during the planning and execution of the procedure. Additionally, the development of acute renal failure postoperatively requires close monitoring and aggressive management to preserve renal function and prevent further complications.
