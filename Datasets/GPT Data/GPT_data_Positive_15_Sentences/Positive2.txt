The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an appendectomy. He has a medical history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of smoking for 20 years but quit five years ago. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 55.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had a tonsillectomy when he was a child and had an inguinal hernia repair five years ago. The hernia repair surgery was successful, and he did not experience any complications.

The patient's current medications include lisinopril for hypertension, which he takes daily as prescribed. He also takes a daily multivitamin and exercises regularly.

Laboratory tests show that the patient has normal renal function with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, are within the normal range. The patient also does not have any significant allergies.

However, following the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure, which is a complication characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function. This occurs as a result of decreased blood flow to the kidneys or direct damage to the kidneys during the surgical procedure. The patient presents with symptoms such as decreased urine output, fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and increased levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in the blood.

To manage the patient's acute renal failure, appropriate measures are taken, including fluid and electrolyte management, diuretic therapy, and close monitoring of kidney function. In some cases, hemodialysis may be necessary to support kidney function and remove waste products from the blood.

The patient's prognosis depends on the severity and underlying cause of the acute renal failure, as well as prompt and adequate treatment. Follow-up appointments and regular monitoring of kidney function will be necessary to assess recovery and prevent further complications. The patient will also need education regarding lifestyle modifications, including maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and avoiding nephrotoxic medications.
