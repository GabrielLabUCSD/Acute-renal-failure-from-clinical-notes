The patient is a 59-year-old male who has a long history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. He is planned to undergo surgery due to severe osteoarthritis in his left hip joint. The patient has been experiencing chronic pain, limited mobility, and progressive joint degeneration for the past three years, leading to the decision for a total hip replacement surgery.

He has a history of hypertension for over ten years, for which he is currently taking medications. The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled within normal limits over the past year. He also has well-managed type 2 diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications. His last HbA1c was recorded at 6.5%.

Additionally, the patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 34, indicating obesity. Although he has tried various weight loss strategies, he has been unable to sustain significant weight reduction. This obesity places him at an increased risk for surgical complications such as delayed wound healing, deep vein thrombosis, and increased overall surgical morbidity.

The patient has no known allergies or previous adverse reactions to any medications. He has no history of bleeding disorders, and his preoperative bloodwork, including a complete blood count and clotting profile, showed normal results. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and no significant abnormalities.

After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypoperfusion and renal hypoxia during the procedure. His serum creatinine levels rapidly increased from 0.9 mg/dL pre-operatively to 3.5 mg/dL post-operatively. He also had a reduced urinary output and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels.

His vital signs showed stable blood pressure and heart rate, but he experienced mild oliguria. The patient developed metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.25 and a decreased bicarbonate level. Renal ultrasound revealed no obstructive causes for his acute renal failure.

The patient was promptly treated with intravenous fluids, diuretics, and strict monitoring of electrolyte balance. The renal function gradually improved over the following days, with a steady decrease in serum creatinine levels. He was closely monitored for any signs of infection or worsening renal function.

The patient's postoperative course was otherwise unremarkable, with no signs of wound infection or thromboembolic events. He was discharged from the hospital after six days, with stable renal function and an appropriate surgical outcome. He will be followed up as an outpatient to ensure ongoing renal function recovery and proper rehabilitation after the surgery.
