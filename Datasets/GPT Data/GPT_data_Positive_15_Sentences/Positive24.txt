The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes, all well-controlled with medications. The patient has a family history of heart disease, with both his parents suffering from heart attacks in their 60s.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent a knee replacement surgery 5 years ago, with no complications reported. He also had a hernia repair surgery 10 years ago, which was successful. The patient does not have any known allergies to medications or anesthesia.

The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He exercises regularly, maintaining a healthy weight and a balanced diet. The patient reports having occasional episodes of mild shortness of breath, especially during physical exertion.

As for current medications, the patient takes lisinopril for hypertension, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, and metformin for type 2 diabetes. The patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels are well-controlled and within the normal range.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient's electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were normal. The patient also underwent blood tests, which revealed normal complete blood count and liver function tests. However, the patient's renal function tests showed signs of impaired kidney function, with elevated creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This indicates acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-existing kidney disease.

The patient's surgical team is aware of his medical history and the complication of acute renal failure. They will closely monitor his renal function during and after the surgery to minimize any potential risks and complications. The anesthesiologist will also tailor the anesthetic plan to accommodate the patient's compromised renal function.

Overall, the patient is a generally healthy individual with well-controlled chronic conditions. However, the acute renal failure complication presents an additional challenge in the management of his upcoming surgery, requiring careful monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach.
