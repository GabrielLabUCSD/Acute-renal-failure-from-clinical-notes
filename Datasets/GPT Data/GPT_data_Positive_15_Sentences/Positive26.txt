The patient had a myocardial infarction two years ago and has undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
He is currently on medications including metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin.
His overall cardiac function is stable, and he has been cleared for surgery by the cardiology team.
The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease, with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45 mL/min/1.73m².
He has been followed by a nephrologist and managed with dietary modifications.
Preoperative labs reveal an elevated serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL and a reduced eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73m².
The patient has no known allergies to medications.
He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally.
During the surgery, the patient experienced a drop in blood pressure and required fluid resuscitation.
Postoperatively, he developed oliguria and was found to have anuria within the first 24 hours, raising concerns for acute renal failure.
His creatinine level increased to 3.2 mg/dL, and his eGFR decreased to 15 mL/min/1.73m².
Renal ultrasound was performed, showing normal kidney size and no evidence of obstruction.
The patient was started on fluid and electrolyte management and monitored closely by nephrology for signs of recovery or further deterioration.
Renal replacement therapy may be considered if there is no improvement in the renal function.
