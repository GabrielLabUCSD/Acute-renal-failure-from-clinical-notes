The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both of which are well-managed with medication. He does not have any known allergies or previous adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy 10 years ago and a tonsillectomy in childhood. He has never had any complications from these surgeries and the recovery was uneventful.

His current medications include metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and a daily low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. He is compliant with his medications and has stable blood pressure and blood glucose levels.

The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol excessively. He exercises regularly and maintains a healthy weight. He has a good support system at home with his spouse who will assist with his post-operative care.

During the pre-operative evaluation, the patient underwent a comprehensive physical examination, which revealed no abnormal findings. His laboratory results were within the normal range, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies.

The patient was thoroughly educated about the surgery, including the benefits, risks, and potential complications. He provided informed consent for the procedure and was psychologically prepared for the surgery.

Following the surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure as a complication. This was likely due to the use of certain medications during the perioperative period, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and intravenous contrast for imaging studies.

The patient's renal function deteriorated rapidly, leading to decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. He required immediate intervention, including fluid resuscitation and initiation of renal supportive measures, such as hemodialysis.

The patient's condition stabilized after the initiation of treatment, and his renal function gradually improved. He underwent several sessions of hemodialysis and was closely monitored for any further complications.

The acute renal failure was determined to be a temporary complication, likely due to the combination of surgical stress, medications, and possible pre-existing susceptibility. The patient's overall prognosis was favorable, and he was expected to fully recover from the renal failure with no long-term complications.

The surgical team collaborated with the nephrology department to optimize the patient's kidney function prior to scheduling the hernia repair surgery. They took necessary precautions to minimize the risk of recurrent renal failure, such as avoiding nephrotoxic medications and closely monitoring fluid and electrolyte balance.

The patient's surgery was successfully performed a few months later, and he recovered well without any further complications. He was discharged home with appropriate pain management and follow-up instructions. The patient continued to have regular check-ups with his primary care physician and nephrologist to ensure his renal function remained stable.
