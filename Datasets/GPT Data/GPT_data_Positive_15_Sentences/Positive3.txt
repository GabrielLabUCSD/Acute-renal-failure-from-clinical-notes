The patient is a 45-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for an appendectomy. He has a past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. He takes medications for his hypertension and dyslipidemia and has been struggling with weight loss. He also has a family history of heart disease and diabetes.

During the pre-operative evaluation, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his physical examination was unremarkable. However, his laboratory results revealed slightly elevated fasting blood sugar levels and mildly elevated cholesterol levels. The patient reported no known drug allergies.

The patient provided a detailed history of smoking for the past 20 years, consuming approximately half a pack of cigarettes per day. He has attempted to quit smoking multiple times but has been unsuccessful. He acknowledges the detrimental effects of smoking on his health and expressed a willingness to quit after the surgery.

In addition to the appendectomy, the patient will also undergo general anesthesia for the surgery. He was informed about the potential risks and complications associated with anesthesia and surgery, including infection, bleeding, and adverse reactions to medications.

Following the surgery, the patient developed post-operative complications, including acute renal failure. He presented with decreased urine output, fluid overload, and an increase in serum creatinine levels. The patient was promptly started on intravenous fluids and closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's medication regimen included antibiotics to prevent infection, pain medications, and diuretics to promote urine output and maintain fluid balance. The surgical team consulted the nephrology department for further management of the patient's acute renal failure.

The patient's renal function gradually improved over the course of several days, and he was eventually discharged from the hospital with close follow-up scheduled with the nephrologist. He was also advised to continue taking his antihypertensive and dyslipidemia medications and to follow up with his primary care physician for ongoing management of his chronic conditions.

The patient received counseling on the importance of quitting smoking to improve his overall health and reduce the risk of complications from future surgeries. He expressed a renewed commitment to quitting smoking and was referred to a smoking cessation program for further support.
