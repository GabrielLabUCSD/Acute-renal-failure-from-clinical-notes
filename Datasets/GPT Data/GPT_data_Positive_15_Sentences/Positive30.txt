The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes, which are well-controlled with medication. He had a vague abdominal pain for the past month, which prompted the need for surgical intervention.

Mr. Smith has no known drug allergies and is not a smoker. His alcohol consumption is within moderate limits. He does not have a family history of any significant conditions. He reports being generally in good health prior to the surgical consultation.

His pre-operative laboratory values were unremarkable, with normal kidney function, liver function, and blood counts. He did not have any signs or symptoms of acute illness at the time of evaluation and had a normal physical examination.

The surgical procedure is planned to be performed under general anesthesia, and all necessary pre-operative evaluations and clearances have been obtained. The anesthesiology team has been made aware of his medical history and will take appropriate precautions during the surgery.

However, following the surgery, Mr. Smith developed acute renal failure. He presented with decreased urine output, edema, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and muddy brown casts, indicating acute tubular necrosis.

The cause of his renal failure was determined to be due to perioperative hypotension and inadequate fluid resuscitation. He was promptly started on intravenous fluids and medications to support renal function. His kidney function gradually improved over the next few days.

In addition to the acute renal failure complication, Mr. Smith's post-operative course was otherwise uneventful. He was monitored closely in the surgical intensive care unit and his pain was managed with appropriate pain medications. Daily laboratory tests were performed to monitor his kidney function, electrolyte levels, and fluid status.

After a week of intensive care management, Mr. Smith's renal function improved substantially and he was transferred to a regular surgical ward. He continued to receive close monitoring and supportive care to ensure his renal recovery.

The multidisciplinary team including nephrologists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists collaborated to provide optimal care for Mr. Smith. They discussed the need for aggressive fluid management during surgery and strategies to prevent future complications from perioperative hypotension.

Mr. Smith's renal function continued to improve over the following weeks and he was discharged home with close outpatient follow-up. He was instructed to continue taking his regular medications for hypertension and diabetes. It was advised to monitor his kidney function periodically to ensure complete recovery.

Overall, Mr. Smith's surgical procedure was successful, but he experienced a complication of acute renal failure. He received appropriate medical intervention and management, leading to a gradual improvement in his renal function.
