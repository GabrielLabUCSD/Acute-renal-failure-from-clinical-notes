The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 65-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. His blood pressure is usually well-controlled with medication, but his diabetes requires insulin therapy.

Mr. Smith has been on a strict diet and exercise regimen to manage his diabetes, and his blood glucose levels have been relatively stable. He has been adherent to his medications, including antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemic agents.

His chronic kidney disease has been managed conservatively, with regular monitoring of his creatinine levels and maintaining strict blood pressure control. He does not require dialysis at this time.

In preparation for surgery, Mr. Smith has undergone pre-operative assessment, which included a thorough medical history, physical examination, and various laboratory tests. His pre-operative labs were within normal limits, including his renal function.

During the surgery, Mr. Smith experienced complications that led to acute renal failure. The exact cause of the complication is unclear at this time, but it could be related to the surgery itself or anesthesia.

Following the surgery, Mr. Smith developed oliguria, with a significantly decreased urine output. His creatinine levels started to rise, indicating impaired kidney function. He also experienced electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis.

To manage his acute renal failure, Mr. Smith was started on renal replacement therapy, specifically hemodialysis. This involves filtering his blood through a machine to remove waste products and excess fluid, compensating for his impaired kidney function.

Mr. Smith is currently being closely monitored in the intensive care unit. His vital signs, urine output, and laboratory values are being monitored regularly. He is also receiving intravenous fluid therapy, medications to manage his electrolyte imbalances, and close attention to his blood pressure control.

The management of his diabetes has been adjusted to account for his acute renal failure, with a focus on tight glycemic control to prevent further complications.

The multidisciplinary team, including nephrologists, surgeons, and nurses, is working together to optimize Mr. Smith's care and improve his kidney function. The goal is to gradually restore his renal function and eventually wean him off hemodialysis.

Mr. Smith's prognosis is guarded, as acute renal failure can be a complex and unpredictable condition. Close monitoring, aggressive management, and multidisciplinary collaboration will be key in his recovery process.
