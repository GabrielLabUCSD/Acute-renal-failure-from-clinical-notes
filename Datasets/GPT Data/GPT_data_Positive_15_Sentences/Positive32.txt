The patient's family history is significant for coronary artery disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 60. The patient's mother has a history of breast cancer. The patient is married and lives with his spouse, who supports him in his healthcare decisions.

On physical examination, the patient is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. He has well-controlled blood pressure at 128/78 mmHg. His heart rate is regular at 75 beats per minute.

Following surgery, the patient experiences acute renal failure, most likely as a result of the surgery. His serum creatinine levels are elevated and he is oliguric. The patient is started on intravenous fluids and his medications are adjusted to consider his renal function.

The patient is closely monitored in the post-operative period for any signs of worsening renal function or complications related to the acute renal failure. The surgical team collaborates with nephrologists to ensure optimal management of the patient's renal function.

Further investigations are conducted to identify the cause of the acute renal failure. These include imaging studies to assess for any obstruction or vascular compromise, as well as a thorough review of the patient's medication history.

Overall, the patient's medical history and risk factors are taken into consideration to optimize the surgical plan and reduce the risk of complications. The acute renal failure is managed with appropriate interventions and close monitoring to ensure the patient's optimal recovery.
