The patient is a middle-aged individual who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. They have been actively managing their chronic conditions with medication and lifestyle modifications. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.

Prior to the surgery, the patient was evaluated by the anesthesiology team to assess their overall physical health and anesthesia tolerance. Preoperative blood work revealed normal liver function, but mild renal impairment with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. The patient's baseline creatinine level is typically within normal range at 0.9 mg/dL.

During the surgery, the patient was under general anesthesia for approximately 3 hours. The surgical procedure was uneventful, but significant blood loss occurred which required a blood transfusion. The patient was closely monitored during the surgery to ensure stable vital signs.

Postoperatively, the patient developed acute renal failure. The exact cause is unclear, but it is believed to be multifactorial. Possible contributors include hypotension during the surgery leading to renal ischemia, the administration of nephrotoxic medications, and the cumulative effect of preexisting renal impairment.

The patient's renal function deteriorated further in the days following the surgery, with a peak creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL. They experienced oliguria, with urine output below 400 mL per day. Additional symptoms included fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic acidosis. The patient was promptly started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to support renal function.

To manage the acute renal failure, the patient's fluid intake and output were closely monitored. Diuretics were administered to enhance urine output and promote fluid removal. Electrolyte imbalances were corrected through supplementation, and acid-base balance was restored by providing bicarbonate infusions.

The patient's renal function gradually improved over the course of several days. Diuresis increased, and urine output returned to normal range. Creatinine levels began to decrease, reaching a nadir of 1.8 mg/dL. The patient was weaned off CRRT and transitioned to conservative management.

The patient's physician emphasized the importance of close follow-up and advised them against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to their potential to exacerbate renal impairment. Further evaluations will be conducted to assess the long-term impact on the patient's renal function, and appropriate measures will be taken to prevent future renal complications.
