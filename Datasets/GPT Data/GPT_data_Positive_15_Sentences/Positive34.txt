The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. His hypertension is well controlled with medications. He takes metformin for his diabetes and has good glycemic control with a recent HbA1c of 6.5%. The patient has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He denies any history of lung disease or cardiac issues.

The patient's chronic kidney disease is monitored regularly, and his most recent creatinine level was 1.5 mg/dL. He has no symptoms of uremia, such as nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status. His urine output is within normal limits, and he denies any urinary symptoms. The patient does not require dialysis at this time.

In preparation for surgery, the patient's medications have been reviewed, and he has been advised to hold his metformin on the day of surgery. He will continue taking his antihypertensive medication up until the morning of surgery. Preoperative laboratory tests including complete blood count, coagulation profile, and basic metabolic panel have been ordered. The patient has been advised to avoid any food or drink after midnight the night before surgery.

During surgery, the patient experienced complications including hypotension and hemorrhage. He required transfusion of packed red blood cells and received intravenous fluids to stabilize his blood pressure. In the postoperative period, the patient developed acute renal failure, likely due to the hypotensive episode and decreased renal perfusion. His creatinine levels rose to 3.2 mg/dL, and his urine output decreased significantly. He was started on continuous renal replacement therapy to manage his acute renal failure.

The patient's renal function is closely monitored, and he remains on the renal replacement therapy. His fluid balance is carefully managed to prevent fluid overload or dehydration. The patient is also started on antibiotics due to the risk of infection associated with renal failure. Further investigation is underway to determine the cause of the acute renal failure and to guide appropriate management.

The patient's surgical wounds are healing well, and he is closely monitored for signs of infection. Pain control measures are in place to ensure the patient's comfort. The patient is counseled on the importance of strict adherence to his medication regimen, including antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemics, and any prescribed renal medications.

The patient's prognosis depends on the underlying cause and severity of his acute renal failure. With appropriate management and close monitoring, the aim is to restore his renal function and prevent further complications. The patient is advised to follow up regularly with his primary care physician and nephrologist to ensure optimal management of his chronic kidney disease and prevent future episodes of acute renal failure.
