The patient is a XX-year-old male/female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity (BMI XX). The patient presents to the clinic with complaints of severe knee pain and impaired mobility due to osteoarthritis. After a thorough evaluation, it was determined that the patient requires a knee replacement surgery.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on a combination of medications, including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient's diabetes is managed with metformin, with a recent HbA1c of XX%. The patient reports good compliance and adherence to their medication regimen.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy in childhood without any complications. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and their vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, are within normal limits, indicating an overall good medical condition for surgery.

The patient is scheduled for surgery and has been counseled about the potential risks and benefits involved. However, despite standardized preventive measures, the patient develops acute renal failure immediately following surgery. Lab results reveal elevated serum creatinine, reduced urine output, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's acute renal failure may be attributed to a combination of pre-existing risk factors, including hypertension and diabetes, as well as the surgical stress and decreased renal perfusion during the procedure. Immediate intervention is initiated, including hydration, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters.

A nephrologist is consulted for further management of the patient's acute renal failure. The patient is started on renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis) to support kidney function while optimizing electrolyte and fluid balance.

Close monitoring of the patient's renal function, fluid status, and electrolyte levels are necessary post-operatively. The patient will require follow-up care by the nephrology team to reassess renal function and determine the duration of renal replacement therapy.

Overall, the patient's comprehensive medical history puts them at a higher risk for complications during and after surgery. The development of acute renal failure further complicates the patient's recovery process and necessitates close monitoring and intervention to achieve optimal outcomes.
