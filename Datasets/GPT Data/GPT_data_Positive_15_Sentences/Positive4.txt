The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been on medications to control his blood pressure. His hyperlipidemia was diagnosed five years ago, and he has been taking statins to manage his cholesterol levels. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 ten years ago and has been on oral hypoglycemic agents to control his blood sugar levels.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy 20 years ago and a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. He tolerated both surgeries well without any complications. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a heart attack in his 60s.

During the pre-operative assessment, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, and his laboratory results showed well-controlled blood pressure and blood sugar levels. His renal function tests were also within normal range.

Post-operatively, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was likely caused by hypovolemia and the use of nephrotoxic medications during surgery. The patient presented with oliguria, elevated serum creatinine, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. He required intravenous fluid resuscitation and the discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications to manage his acute renal failure.

The patient's recovery was monitored closely with daily urine output measurements, serum creatinine levels, and electrolyte panel assessments. The acute renal failure gradually resolved, and the patient was able to resume normal renal function within two weeks.

Given the patient's medical history, the surgical team ensured close monitoring of his blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and renal function throughout the perioperative period. The patient received appropriate perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and was managed with strict glycemic control to minimize surgical site infection and post-operative hyperglycemia.

The patient was also given education regarding the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, adherence to medication regimens, and proper management of his chronic conditions. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for continued management of his hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Additionally, the patient was counseled on the need for regular check-ups and monitoring of his renal function to ensure early detection and management of any potential complications.
