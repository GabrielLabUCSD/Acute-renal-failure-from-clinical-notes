Patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. The patient is currently on antihypertensive medications, metformin for diabetes management, and a weight loss regimen.

He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases, with both his parents having experienced heart attacks in their late 60s. The patient is a smoker, consuming about 10 cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. He occasionally consumes alcohol in moderate amounts.

The patient has been experiencing occasional shortness of breath and chest discomfort upon exertion, which has been attributed to his obesity and sedentary lifestyle. He has not undergone any cardiac evaluations but has scheduled a stress test prior to the surgery for further assessment.

Lab results show a mildly elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c indicating average blood sugar control over the past three months. His blood pressure is well-controlled with medication, averaging around 130/80 mmHg. The patient's body mass index (BMI) is 35, which is classified as obese.

During surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure as a complication. This is characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function, resulting in reduced urine output, electrolyte abnormalities, and accumulation of waste products in the body. The patient experiences fluid overload, leading to swelling in the legs and shortness of breath.

The cause of the acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, including the use of anesthesia, decreased blood flow to the kidneys during surgery, and pre-existing conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. The patient's medications are adjusted to account for his impaired kidney function.

Further investigations, such as a renal ultrasound and blood tests, are conducted to evaluate the extent of kidney damage and identify any underlying causes. The patient is closely monitored and provided with intravenous fluids and medications to manage electrolyte imbalances and improve kidney function.

With appropriate treatment and close monitoring, the patient's kidney function gradually improves over the next few days. The patient is advised to continue medications for hypertension and diabetes, as well as make lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of future complications. A follow-up appointment is scheduled to assess the ongoing management of the patient's chronic conditions and address any concerns he may have.
