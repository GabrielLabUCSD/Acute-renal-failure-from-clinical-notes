The patient, aged 65, is planning to have surgery for a hip replacement. They have a medical history that includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been taking medications for these conditions, including lisinopril for hypertension and metformin for diabetes.

In addition to these conditions, the patient also has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 5 years ago. They have a BMI of 32, indicating obesity. Despite this, the patient has been active and walks daily for exercise.

Blood tests indicate that the patient has well-controlled hypertension and diabetes. However, their lipid profile reveals elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

The patient also reports occasional episodes of chest pain, which have been ruled out as cardiac in nature. They have undergone previous cardiac testing, including a stress test, which showed no significant abnormalities.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago and an appendectomy 15 years ago. Both surgeries were uncomplicated.

During the post-operative period, the patient experienced acute renal failure. This resulted in a decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine levels. The patient required hemodialysis to manage the renal failure.

Investigations revealed that the cause of acute renal failure was likely multifactorial, with factors such as hypotension, prolonged surgery duration, and the use of nephrotoxic medications contributing to the development of this complication.

The patient's renal function gradually improved with dialysis and supportive care. They were eventually discharged from the hospital with stable renal function and advised to follow up with a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient's medical history includes several comorbidities that can increase the risk of surgical complications. Additionally, their acute renal failure post-surgery highlights the importance of close monitoring and appropriate management in such cases.
