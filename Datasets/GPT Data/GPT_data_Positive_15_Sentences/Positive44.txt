The patient, a 55-year-old male, is scheduled for surgery to treat a hernia. His medical history includes a diagnosis of hypertension, which has been controlled with medication for the past five years. He is a non-smoker and has no history of allergies. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32 and does not engage in regular physical activity.

In regards to his surgical history, he had undergone a cholecystectomy five years ago without any complications. It is important to note that he had no prior heart or lung surgeries. The patient will be undergoing general anesthesia for the upcoming hernia surgery.

Following the surgery, the patient experienced complications in the form of acute renal failure. He presented with decreased urine output, fluid retention, and increased levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in his blood tests. The patient developed oliguria, with urine output less than 400 ml per day.

The cause of the acute renal failure was determined to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely related to prolonged hypotension during the surgery. He was promptly started on intravenous fluids and diuretics to improve his urine output and address the fluid overload.

Furthermore, the patient's blood pressure, which was previously well-controlled, began to fluctuate post-surgery. The hypertensive episodes were managed with antihypertensive medications such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

The patient's lab results showed an elevated white blood cell count, indicating the presence of an infection. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the infection, while appropriate cultures were collected to guide targeted therapy.

Due to the acute renal failure, the patient required daily monitoring of his electrolyte levels to ensure proper balance. He was also put on a restricted fluid and sodium intake to help manage his fluid retention.

The patient's progress was carefully monitored, and his urine output gradually improved over the course of a week. His renal function gradually returned to baseline, and he met the criteria for discharge.

Before discharge, the patient received education on the need for continued follow-up with his primary care physician to monitor his blood pressure and kidney function. He was also instructed to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, to minimize the risk of hypertension and future surgical complications.

In summary, the patient had a history of hypertension and underwent surgery for hernia repair. He experienced complications in the form of acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension during the procedure. These complications were successfully managed with appropriate interventions, including fluid management, antibiotics, and monitoring of renal function. The patient's blood pressure fluctuations and infection were also addressed during his hospital stay.
