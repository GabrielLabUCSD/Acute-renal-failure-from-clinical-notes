The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. He has been on medications for blood pressure control and diabetes management for the past 10 years. His hypertension has been adequately controlled with a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. His diabetes is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents.

The patient recently presented with severe osteoarthritis in both knees, impairing his mobility and quality of life. After consultations with an orthopedic surgeon, he has decided to undergo bilateral total knee replacement surgery. He has been advised to continue his antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications until the day of surgery.

Preoperative investigations revealed mild anemia, with hemoglobin levels at 11 g/dL, and a mild elevation in serum creatinine levels (1.3 mg/dL). His renal function has been stable, with no significant changes in the past year. He has no history of acute kidney injury or other major complications.

During the surgery, the patient received general anesthesia and underwent a successful bilateral total knee replacement procedure. He was closely monitored for blood pressure control, fluid balance, and blood glucose levels throughout the surgery and immediate postoperative period. Adequate blood pressure control was achieved with intravenous antihypertensive medications, and blood glucose levels were managed with an insulin infusion.

However, on the second postoperative day, the patient developed acute renal failure, presenting with a significant decrease in urine output, elevated serum creatinine levels (3.0 mg/dL), and metabolic acidosis. The cause of the renal failure was determined to be acute tubular necrosis, likely due to intraoperative hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications. The patient was immediately managed with volume resuscitation, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and initiation of renal replacement therapy.

Further investigations were ordered to identify any reversible causes of the acute renal failure, including imaging studies and urine analysis. The patient was also started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to prevent/treat any possible infection-related causes of the renal failure.

The patient continues to be closely monitored in the intensive care unit, with frequent assessments of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and renal function. Renal replacement therapy is being continued to support the patient's renal function until recovery is achieved. The surgical team and nephrologist are working collaboratively to optimize the patient's management and provide appropriate postoperative care.

The patient's renal function will need to be re-evaluated once he stabilizes, and a decision will be made regarding the duration of renal replacement therapy. Long-term follow-up will be necessary to monitor for any residual renal dysfunction or chronic kidney disease progression. The patient's blood pressure and diabetes control will also be closely monitored and adjusted as needed to prevent further complications.
