The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. He has been on medication for his hypertension for the past 10 years. His diabetes is controlled with oral medication, and he has been monitoring his blood sugars regularly. The patient's body mass index (BMI) is 35, indicating severe obesity.

The patient is scheduled for surgery due to a hernia repair. He has been experiencing symptoms of pain and discomfort in the abdominal area for the past few months. The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia, and the patient will be kept under observation for a few days postoperatively.

The patient has no known allergies to medications and has previously undergone a cholecystectomy without any complications. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

During the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure as a complication. The sudden decline in kidney function is likely due to hypoperfusion caused by intraoperative hypotension and decreased blood flow to the kidneys. The patient's urine output decreases significantly, and his serum creatinine levels rise.

To manage the acute renal failure, the patient is immediately started on hemodialysis to help remove excess fluid and waste products from his blood. He is closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances and is given intravenous fluids to maintain hydration.

The patient's renal function gradually improves over the next few days, and hemodialysis is gradually tapered off as the kidneys regain function. The patient is encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle and manage his hypertension and diabetes to prevent any further renal complications.

Following the surgery, the patient is advised to take pain medications as prescribed, follow a balanced diet, and engage in light physical activity to aid in the healing process. He is scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to monitor his renal function and overall health.

Overall, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple comorbidities that predisposed him to develop acute renal failure after surgery. However, with appropriate management and monitoring, his renal function is expected to gradually improve, and he can expect a successful recovery from the surgical procedure.
