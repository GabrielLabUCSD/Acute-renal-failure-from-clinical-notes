The patient is a XX-year-old male/female who is planning to have surgery. They have a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease stage III. The patient has been on metoprolol and lisinopril for blood pressure control, and metformin for diabetes management. They have a history of smoking for 10 years but quit five years ago. The patient denies any known drug allergies. 

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy 15 years ago without any complications. They have not had any other surgeries since then. The patient reports no significant family history of cardiac diseases, cancers, or surgical complications. 

During the pre-operative workup, the patient's labs revealed mildly elevated HbA1c levels at 7.5%, indicating suboptimal diabetes control. Their pre-operative EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no ischemic changes. The patient's renal function tests showed a stable decline in kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 52 mL/min/1.73m². 

The patient was started on pre-operative antibiotics and advised to continue their home medications until the day of surgery, with the exception of metformin, which was held on the day of surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis. The patient was also advised to have nothing by mouth after midnight before the surgery. 

During the surgery, the patient experienced significant blood loss and required a blood transfusion. The procedure was uncomplicated, but the patient developed acute renal failure post-operatively. The patient's creatinine level increased to 2.5 mg/dL, and their eGFR decreased to 30 mL/min/1.73m². 

The patient was monitored closely for signs of fluid overload and started on intravenous fluids to optimize their renal perfusion. Their blood pressure was managed with intravenous medications, aiming for a target systolic blood pressure of 120-130 mmHg. The patient's urine output remained low, and they required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for renal support.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team including nephrologists and surgeons, and efforts are being made to improve their renal function. Diuretics were cautiously administered, and their fluid and electrolyte balance was closely monitored. The patient was also counseled on the importance of adherence to their prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications for better renal function. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to assess their progress.
