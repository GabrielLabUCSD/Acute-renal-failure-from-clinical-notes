The patient, a 65-year-old male, has a significant medical history involving several chronic conditions. He suffers from hypertension, which was diagnosed 10 years ago, and is currently controlled with medication. The patient also has type 2 diabetes, diagnosed 5 years ago, for which he takes oral hypoglycemic agents.

In addition, the patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, with elevated cholesterol levels for the past 3 years. He is on a statin medication to manage this condition. The patient has also been diagnosed with atherosclerosis, and has a stent in place due to a previous coronary artery blockage.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy 20 years ago and a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. Both procedures were uncomplicated. He underwent a knee replacement surgery 3 years ago, which was successful in relieving his chronic knee pain.

The patient has a known drug allergy to penicillin and reports experiencing an anaphylactic reaction to it in the past. He is considered a non-smoker, with no history of alcohol or substance abuse.

Following the most recent surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure as a complication. His preoperative labs showed elevated creatinine levels, indicative of impaired kidney function. The patient experienced a decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine levels in the postoperative period. The current working diagnosis is postoperative acute kidney injury.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for his renal failure, including close monitoring of his fluid intake and output. His renal function is being closely monitored through regular labs, and he has been started on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration.

The surgical team is optimizing the patient's renal function by adjusting medications that could potentially worsen the kidneys' condition. The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored and controlled to ensure optimal perfusion to the kidneys. Renal replacement therapy options, such as hemodialysis, may be considered if his renal function does not improve.

The patient's overall prognosis will depend on the underlying cause of his acute renal failure and his response to treatment. Close monitoring will be necessary to prevent further complications and ensure the best possible outcome.
