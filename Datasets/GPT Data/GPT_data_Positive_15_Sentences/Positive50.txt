The patient is a 55-year-old female who is planning to have surgery for an intestinal obstruction. She has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. The patient had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) five years ago and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She currently takes medications for her hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.

The patient also has a history of obesity and smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. She acknowledges that smoking increases the risk of complications during surgery and is willing to quit smoking before the procedure.

During preoperative evaluations, the patient's renal function was found to be slightly impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. She has no history of kidney disease, and her kidney function has been stable over the past few years.

The patient's surgery is performed without any immediate complications, and she is closely monitored in the postoperative period. However, on the second day after surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure. Her creatinine level increases to 3.8 mg/dL, and her urine output decreases significantly.

A thorough evaluation is carried out to determine the cause of the acute renal failure. It is found that the patient had a decrease in kidney blood flow during the surgery due to intraoperative hypotension and decreased cardiac output.

Interventions are immediately initiated to address the acute renal failure. The patient is placed on intravenous fluids to optimize her fluid status and increase renal perfusion. Diuretic medications are also administered to promote urine output and prevent fluid overload.

The patient's renal function gradually improves over the next few days. Her urine output increases, and her creatinine level begins to decrease. However, she continues to require close monitoring in the intensive care unit.

During her hospital stay, the patient receives regular dialysis sessions to support her kidney function while her kidneys recover. She is also closely monitored for any signs of infection or other complications.

The patient's renal function gradually improves over the next two weeks, and her creatinine level returns to baseline. She is discharged from the hospital with instructions to continue taking her medications and follow up with her primary care physician for further management of her chronic medical conditions.

The acute renal failure experienced by the patient was likely due to perioperative hypoperfusion and decreased renal blood flow. The patient's pre-existing medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may have also contributed to her increased susceptibility to acute kidney injury. Ongoing management and regular follow-up will be essential to prevent future renal complications.
