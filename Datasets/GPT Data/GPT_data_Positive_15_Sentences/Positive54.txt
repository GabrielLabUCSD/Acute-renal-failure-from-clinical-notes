The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an elective procedure. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has been taking medications to manage these conditions, including metoprolol for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled on the current regimen, with readings consistently below 130/80 mmHg. His blood glucose levels have also been stable, with a recent HbA1c of 6.5%. The patient has been compliant with his medications and reports no significant side effects.

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He denies any respiratory symptoms and has a normal pulmonary function test. He has no known allergies and has not previously had any anesthesia or surgical procedures.

Laboratory tests conducted within the past month show normal kidney function, with serum creatinine levels at 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 85 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating normal kidney function. Urinalysis results were unremarkable.

During the surgical procedure, the patient developed acute renal failure as a postoperative complication. This was diagnosed based on a significant increase in serum creatinine levels, which rose to 2.5 mg/dL from a baseline of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient also experienced a decrease in urine output, indicating impaired renal function.

The cause of the acute renal failure was likely multifactorial, involving both pre-existing chronic kidney disease and the perioperative insult. Prompt medical intervention was initiated to manage the patient's renal failure, including aggressive fluid resuscitation and medication adjustments.

A nephrology consult was obtained, and the patient is currently being closely monitored in the intensive care unit. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, may be required if the patient's renal function does not improve.

Overall, the patient's medical history suggests that he is at an increased risk for surgical and postoperative complications due to his chronic illnesses. Close monitoring and intervention are necessary to manage the acute renal failure and prevent further complications.
