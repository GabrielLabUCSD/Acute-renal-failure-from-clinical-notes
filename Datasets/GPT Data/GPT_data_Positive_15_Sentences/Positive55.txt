The patient, Ms. Anderson, is a 50-year-old female who is scheduled to undergo surgery. She has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. She was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been on antihypertensive medications since then. Her diabetes was diagnosed 5 years ago and is well managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. She also has a family history of heart disease.

Ms. Anderson's weight has been steadily increasing over the years, and she is currently classified as obese with a BMI of 35. She has attempted various weight loss strategies in the past but has been unsuccessful. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol excessively.

Recent laboratory investigations indicate well-controlled blood glucose levels with HbA1c within the target range. However, her renal function tests have shown a decline in kidney function, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 mL/min/1.73 mÂ², indicating stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Her serum creatinine levels have been stable over the past few months.

Regarding the upcoming surgery, Ms. Anderson has been advised by her surgeon to discontinue all antihypertensive medications a day before the procedure. She has been educated about the importance of blood pressure control and will resume her antihypertensive medication post-surgery. She has also been advised to optimize her blood glucose levels prior to the surgery.

Following her surgery, Ms. Anderson experienced postoperative complications in the form of acute renal failure. Her urine output decreased, and her serum creatinine levels elevated to 2.3 mg/dL within two days post-surgery. She required urgent consultation from a nephrologist and was started on intravenous fluids and diuretics. Renal supportive measures, including close monitoring of fluid balance and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, were implemented.

Further investigations revealed that her acute renal failure was multifactorial, likely due to a combination of intraoperative hypotension, prolonged surgery, and use of nephrotoxic medications. Renal replacement therapy was not required, and her renal function gradually improved over the next week. Repeat renal function tests showed a decrease in serum creatinine levels to baseline values, and her urine output returned to normal.

In conclusion, Ms. Anderson is a middle-aged patient with a complex medical history who was planning to have surgery. She had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, and her kidney function showed evidence of chronic kidney disease. Unfortunately, she experienced acute renal failure after the surgery, which was managed by nephrologists, and her renal function gradually improved. Close monitoring and appropriate management of her comorbidities will be crucial in her postoperative recovery.
