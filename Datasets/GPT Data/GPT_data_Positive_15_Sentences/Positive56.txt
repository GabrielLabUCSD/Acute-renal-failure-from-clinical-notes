The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has been managing his conditions with medications, including lisinopril for his hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

Prior to surgery, the patient underwent a thorough preoperative assessment, which included laboratory tests and an evaluation of his cardiac function. His blood tests revealed well-controlled blood glucose levels, with a HbA1c of 6.2%. However, his renal function tests showed mildly impaired kidney function, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 54 mL/min/1.73m².

During the surgery, the patient was given general anesthesia. Unfortunately, he developed an acute renal failure complication postoperatively. This was likely due to a combination of factors, including the stress of surgery, hypovolemia, and nephrotoxic medications used during the procedure. 

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by the need for hemodialysis due to the severity of his acute renal failure. He was monitored closely by the nephrology team, who made adjustments to his fluid and medication regimens to support his kidney function. The patient's urine output gradually improved over the next few days.

In addition to managing the acute renal failure, the patient's other medical conditions were closely monitored and treated. His blood pressure was carefully controlled with intravenous medications, such as nicardipine, and a low-sodium diet was implemented to prevent fluid overload.

To prevent complications, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. He was also encouraged to engage in deep breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia.

Nutritional support was provided to the patient to optimize his healing and support his overall health. He was started on a clear liquid diet initially and advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and his insulin regimen was adjusted as needed.

Physical therapy was initiated to prevent muscle weakness and complications related to immobilization. The patient was encouraged to walk with assistance and perform range of motion exercises to promote mobility.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's pain was effectively managed with medications such as acetaminophen and opioids as needed. He was also given antiemetic medications to prevent nausea and vomiting.

The patient's acute renal failure gradually improved over time, and his kidney function improved to an eGFR of 67 mL/min/1.73m². Hemodialysis was discontinued, and the patient was discharged from the hospital with plans for close monitoring of his kidney function as an outpatient.

The patient was provided with educational materials and instructions on wound care, medication management, and lifestyle modifications post-surgery. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and nephrologist to ensure ongoing management of his medical conditions and renal function.
