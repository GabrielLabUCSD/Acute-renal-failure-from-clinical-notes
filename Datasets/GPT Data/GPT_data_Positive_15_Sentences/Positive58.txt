The patient is a male, aged 55, who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a medical history of hypertension, or high blood pressure, which has been controlled with medication for the past five years. He also has a history of high cholesterol levels, for which he takes statin medication.

The patient does not smoke but consumes alcohol occasionally. He exercises regularly and follows a balanced diet. His family history is significant for heart disease, with both his parents having experienced heart attacks.

On examination, the patient's blood pressure is within the normal range, and he has no signs of organ dysfunction. Laboratory tests show that his kidney function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 90 mL/min/1.73 mÂ².

During the surgery, the patient experiences complications and develops acute renal failure. This is characterized by a sudden loss of kidney function, resulting in the inability to excrete waste products and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Symptoms may include decreased urine output, swelling, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

The cause of the acute renal failure in this case is likely related to the surgery itself, as certain procedures can put stress on the kidneys and disrupt their blood supply. The patient's age, preexisting hypertension, and history of high cholesterol levels may have also contributed to his increased risk of developing acute renal failure.

Management of acute renal failure involves addressing the underlying cause, providing supportive care, and potentially dialysis if necessary. The patient's kidney function will need to be closely monitored to ensure recovery.

It is important to note that acute renal failure is a serious complication and can increase the risk of further complications, such as infection and cardiovascular events. Close post-operative monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to optimize the patient's recovery and prevent long-term damage to the kidneys. Healthcare providers should also take steps to minimize the patient's risk factors for future kidney dysfunction and educate him on the importance of regular follow-up and adherence to medications.
