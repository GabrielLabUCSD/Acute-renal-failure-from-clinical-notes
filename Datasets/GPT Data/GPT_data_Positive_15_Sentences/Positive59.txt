The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. The patient has been on medications for blood pressure control and glycemic management, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a long-acting insulin. He has been compliant with his medications and has regular follow-ups with his primary care physician.

The patient's hypertension has been well controlled with the current medication regimen, with blood pressure consistently around 130/80 mmHg. His diabetes management has also been under control, with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels averaging around 7%. The patient monitors his blood glucose levels at home and adjusts his insulin dosage accordingly.

Since being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, the patient has been following a renal-friendly diet, limiting protein and sodium intake. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is around 45 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating mild to moderate kidney impairment.

Lab tests have shown stable renal function over the past year, with no significant changes in creatinine levels. Urinalysis revealed the presence of microalbuminuria, indicating early kidney damage.

In preparation for the upcoming surgery, the patient has undergone various pre-operative evaluations. His cardiac function was assessed, and an electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. Chest X-ray results were within normal limits, ruling out any underlying respiratory conditions.

However, following the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was likely due to prerenal causes. The surgery resulted in significant blood loss, leading to hypovolemia and subsequent decreased renal perfusion. The patient's urine output declined, and his serum creatinine levels rose rapidly. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, were also observed.

The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids to restore circulating volume and improve renal perfusion. A foley catheter was also inserted to closely monitor the patient's urinary output. He required temporary hemodialysis to manage his electrolyte imbalances and assist in fluid removal.

With prompt intervention and close monitoring, the patient's renal function gradually improved. He was able to tolerate hemodialysis sessions and showed signs of renal recovery. The patient's urine output increased, and his serum creatinine levels began to decrease.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient remained stable and resilient. His blood pressure was well controlled, and his diabetes management continued with appropriate insulin adjustments. A multidisciplinary team, including nephrologists, surgeons, and dietitians, worked closely together to optimize the patient's renal recovery.

Once the patient's renal function had improved sufficiently, hemodialysis was discontinued, and his urine output returned to normal. He was subsequently discharged from the hospital with close outpatient follow-up planned to monitor his renal function and adjust medications as necessary.
