The patient is a 65-year-old male. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has been on medications for these conditions, including an ACE inhibitor, a statin, and oral hypoglycemic agents.

The patient has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. He does not consume alcohol or use recreational drugs. He denies any known drug allergies.

The patient is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. Pre-operative assessments have been performed, including a complete blood count, renal function tests, liver function tests, and an electrocardiogram. All results were within normal limits.

He is physically active, exercises regularly, and has not experienced any significant recent weight changes.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy at the age of 40 and a cholecystectomy at the age of 50. Both procedures were uneventful without any postoperative complications.

Regarding his family history, his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70, and his mother is alive and well with no known medical conditions. There are no significant family histories of cancer or chronic diseases.

The patient has been compliant with his medications and follows up regularly with his primary care physician for routine check-ups. He monitors his blood pressure and blood glucose at home regularly.

Following the hernia repair surgery, the patient developed complications of acute renal failure. This was likely due to intraoperative hypotension and possible ischemic injury to the kidneys. He has been managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, diuretics, and continuous renal replacement therapy.

The patient's renal function has been gradually improving, and he has been closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances and complications related to renal failure.

His current status is stable, and the medical team is working towards optimizing his renal function before considering discharge from the hospital. Further follow-up with a nephrologist is planned to evaluate the long-term effects of the acute renal failure and ensure proper management.
