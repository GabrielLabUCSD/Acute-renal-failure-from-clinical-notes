The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery, although the specific type of surgery is not mentioned. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. The patient has been on medications including metformin for diabetes and lisinopril for hypertension.

His surgical history includes a previous appendectomy performed 10 years ago with no complications noted. The patient does not report any known drug allergies. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father experiencing a myocardial infarction in his late 50s.

During the pre-operative evaluation, laboratory tests were conducted. The patient's blood work showed slightly elevated fasting blood glucose levels of 140 mg/dL and a HbA1c level of 7.5%, indicating suboptimal diabetes control. His renal function was within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 80 mL/min/1.73m².

The patient's physical examination was unremarkable, with no significant findings such as murmurs or abnormal lung sounds. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram results were within normal limits.

Following the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure as a postoperative complication. His urine output decreased significantly, and laboratory findings revealed elevated serum creatinine levels of 2.5 mg/dL and a decreased eGFR of 40 mL/min/1.73m². The patient also complained of general malaise, decreased appetite, and decreased urine production.

Given his history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, the patient had multiple risk factors predisposing him to acute renal failure. The surgery itself, along with potential intraoperative and postoperative factors such as exposure to nephrotoxic medications and inadequate fluid management, may have contributed to the development of this complication.

The patient's management following the diagnosis of acute renal failure included close monitoring of fluid balance, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and initiation of renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis. The surgical team, together with the nephrology team, closely monitored the patient's renal function, fluid status, and response to therapy.

Overall, this patient has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, as well as a surgical history with no previous complications. Unfortunately, he developed acute renal failure after surgery, requiring close monitoring and initiation of appropriate interventions.
