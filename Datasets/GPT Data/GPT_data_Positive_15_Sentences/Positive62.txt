The patient is a 60-year-old male who is currently planning to have surgery. His past medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has been taking oral medications to manage these conditions for the past 10 years.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient also has a history of smoking for 30 years, with a pack-year history of 30. He quit smoking 5 years ago. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.

The patient's surgical history is significant for an appendectomy 20 years ago and an open reduction and internal fixation of his right ankle 15 years ago, following a motor vehicle accident.

His current medications include metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He also takes aspirin daily as a preventive measure for cardiovascular disease.

The patient does not have any known allergies to medications or latex. He reports occasional alcohol consumption, with no history of substance abuse or recreational drug use.

During the pre-operative evaluation, the patient had a routine laboratory workup, which revealed normal kidney function with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. However, after the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function, resulting in elevated serum creatinine levels of 3.0 mg/dL.

This acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including hypotension during surgery, prolonged surgical time, and the use of nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the post-operative period.

The patient's renal function is currently being managed with hydration and close monitoring of his fluid balance. He is also being closely followed by a nephrologist to assess the need for renal replacement therapy such as hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy.

In conclusion, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who is planning to have surgery. He developed acute renal failure post-operatively, and his current management includes hydration and nephrology follow-up.
