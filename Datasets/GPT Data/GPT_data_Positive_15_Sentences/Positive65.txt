The patient is a middle-aged individual who is planning to undergo surgery for an unspecified condition. The patient has a history of asthma, which is well-controlled with inhalers. They also have a history of hypertension, which is currently managed with medications. The patient has had a previous surgery for a gall bladder removal and recovered well without any complications.

In terms of allergies, the patient reports being allergic to penicillin and experiences hives when exposed to it. No other drug allergies have been reported. The patient's current medications include an inhaler for asthma, an antihypertensive medication, and occasional use of over-the-counter pain relievers.

The patient does not smoke and denies any history of alcohol or recreational drug use. They lead an active lifestyle and exercise regularly. The patient has a healthy BMI and does not have any significant family history of medical conditions.

During their recent preoperative assessment, it was noted that the patient's blood tests showed elevated creatinine levels, indicating a possible acute renal failure. The patient denies any symptoms related to kidney dysfunction, such as decreased urine output or swelling. However, they did report feeling fatigued and having trouble concentrating in the past few weeks.

Further investigations are being conducted to determine the cause of the acute renal failure, including imaging studies and additional laboratory tests. The patient's surgery has been postponed until the renal function is further evaluated and stabilized.

The medical team is working closely with the nephrology department to manage the patient's acute renal failure. They have been advised to increase fluid intake to maintain hydration and avoid any medications that could potentially worsen renal function.

The patient has been provided with education and support on the importance of renal health and the need for close monitoring in the perioperative period. The medical team is also ensuring that appropriate measures are in place to minimize any risk factors for renal injury during surgery, such as avoiding nephrotoxic medications and maintaining hemodynamic stability.

Regular follow-up appointments have been scheduled for the patient to monitor their renal function closely. The medical team is hopeful that the acute renal failure will resolve with appropriate management and that the patient will be able to proceed with the planned surgery once their renal function is stable.
