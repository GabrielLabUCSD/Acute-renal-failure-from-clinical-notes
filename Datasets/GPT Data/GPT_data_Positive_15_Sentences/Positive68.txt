The patient is a 45-year-old male who has been experiencing severe pain in his lower back for the past six months. The pain is localized and radiates down his right leg, making it difficult for him to walk or stand for extended periods. Upon examination, the patient has been diagnosed with a herniated disc in his lumbar spine.

The patient's past medical history reveals that he has a history of chronic back pain and has tried multiple conservative treatments such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections, all of which provided only temporary relief. Due to the persistence of his symptoms and the significant impact on his quality of life, the patient has opted to undergo surgery.

The patient has no known allergies and has never had any major surgeries in the past. However, his medical history reveals that he is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He also has a family history of hypertension and diabetes, but he denies experiencing any symptoms related to these conditions.

The patient's physical examination shows tenderness over his lower back and decreased sensation in his right leg. His reflexes are intact, but he has weakness in his right foot dorsiflexion. Laboratory tests have been ordered to assess the patient's overall health status and ensure he is fit for surgery.

Unfortunately, following the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure. This complication is confirmed by elevated levels of serum creatinine and decreased urine output. The cause of the renal failure is suspected to be related to perioperative factors, such as hypoperfusion or exposure to nephrotoxic medications.

Treatment for the acute renal failure involves addressing the underlying cause, ensuring adequate fluid balance, and supporting renal function through renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis. The patient's vital signs are closely monitored, and laboratory tests are performed regularly to assess his renal function and electrolyte balance.

During his hospital stay, the patient's renal function gradually improves, and he is able to regain normal urine output. He no longer requires hemodialysis, and his serum creatinine levels stabilize within the normal range. The patient is closely monitored for any signs of renal complications and is advised to follow up with a nephrologist after discharge.

Overall, the patient's medical history indicates that he is a suitable candidate for surgery, despite the unfortunate development of acute renal failure postoperatively. Close monitoring and appropriate management of the renal complication have resulted in favorable outcomes for the patient, who is expected to make a full recovery.
