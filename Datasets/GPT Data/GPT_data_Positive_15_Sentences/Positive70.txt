The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease (stage 3). He is currently on antihypertensive medications and takes oral hypoglycemic agents to control his medical conditions.

The patient's blood pressure is generally well-controlled with a recent reading of 130/80 mmHg. His diabetes is also adequately managed with a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5%. His kidney function has been relatively stable, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 45 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

In addition to his chronic conditions, the patient has a history of smoking for 20 years but quit 10 years ago. He denies any respiratory symptoms or history of lung diseases. He has received all the necessary pre-operative evaluations, including a chest X-ray, EKG, and blood work, which were all within normal limits.

After the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure, characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function. He presents with oliguria, increased serum creatinine levels, and decreased urine output. The cause of his acute renal failure appears to be related to the surgery itself, as there were no pre-existing indicators of renal dysfunction.

The patient's renal function continues to decline despite conservative management measures such as fluid resuscitation and ensuring adequate renal perfusion. He is started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to support his kidney function and maintain electrolyte balance.

During his hospitalization, the patient develops complications related to the acute renal failure, including electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. He also shows signs of fluid overload, requiring close monitoring of his volume status and diuretic therapy.

The patient's surgical site remains well-healing without signs of infection or other complications. However, the healthcare team remains vigilant for any potential sources of infection, as patients with acute renal failure are more susceptible to infections.

The patient is closely followed by the nephrology team and undergoes regular laboratory testing to assess his renal function and electrolyte levels. He is also encouraged to follow a strict fluid and sodium restriction diet to support his renal recovery.

The patient's prognosis depends on the underlying cause and severity of his acute renal failure. The healthcare team aims to manage his complications and restore his kidney function to prevent any long-term effects on his overall health.
