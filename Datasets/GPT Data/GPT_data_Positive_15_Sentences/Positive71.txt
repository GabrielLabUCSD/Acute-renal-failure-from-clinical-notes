The patient is a 60-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. His medical history reveals that he has a long-standing history of hypertension, which has been managed with medication for the past ten years. He has no previous surgical interventions. The patient also has a history of diabetes, diagnosed five years ago, and he is on oral hypoglycemic agents to control his blood sugar levels.

In terms of allergies, the patient reports no known drug allergies and has not experienced any adverse reactions in the past. His vital signs are within normal limits, with blood pressure averaging 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

Lab investigations show that the patient has a complete blood count within normal ranges, and kidney function tests reveal a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, which is within the normal limits. Electrolyte levels are also within the normal range.

The patient's surgical history is unremarkable, with no previous operations reported. He is physically fit and able to perform activities of daily living without any limitations.

During the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure as a complication. His urine output decreases significantly, and his serum creatinine level rises to 2.5 mg/dL within the first 48 hours post-surgery. This is accompanied by an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels, indicating impaired kidney function.

The patient starts to experience symptoms of acute renal failure, such as decreased urine output, fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and generalized weakness. As a result, he requires close monitoring of his fluid and electrolyte balance, along with regular hemodialysis sessions to manage his acute renal failure.

The healthcare team initiates supportive measures, including intravenous fluid administration, diuretics, and electrolyte correction. They closely monitor the patient's vitals, urine output, and laboratory values to assess his response to treatment.

Further investigation reveals that the acute renal failure is secondary to ischemia-reperfusion injury during the surgery, leading to damage to the renal tubules. The healthcare team develops a comprehensive care plan to address the patient's renal impairment and prevent further complications.

The patient is cautioned to maintain strict compliance with medications and lifestyle modifications to control his hypertension and diabetes. He is advised on the importance of regular follow-up visits and laboratory tests to monitor his kidney function.

In summary, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes, who is scheduled for surgery. Following surgery, he develops acute renal failure as a complication due to ischemia-reperfusion injury. He requires supportive measures, including fluid management, electrolyte correction, and regular hemodialysis sessions to manage the acute renal failure. The patient is advised on the importance of medication compliance, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up appointments to prevent further complications.
