The patient is a 65-year-old male named John Doe who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has been on medications to control these conditions, including metoprolol for his high blood pressure, metformin for his diabetes, and atorvastatin for his high cholesterol.

John Doe has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction in his 50s. He was a smoker for 20 years but quit 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally but denies any illicit drug use.

His physical examination reveals a body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating obesity. He has normal blood pressure readings and no abnormal heart sounds. His blood glucose levels are well-controlled.

His pre-operative lab work shows a normal complete blood count (CBC) and normal liver function tests. However, his renal function tests reveal slightly elevated creatinine levels, suggesting mild renal impairment. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is also slightly low.

During the surgery, John Doe experiences a complication of acute renal failure. This is characterized by a sudden decrease in his kidney function, resulting in the accumulation of waste products and fluid electrolyte imbalances in his body. The cause of his acute renal failure is determined to be due to inadequate blood flow to the kidneys during the surgery.

As a result, John Doe experiences symptoms such as decreased urine output, swelling in his legs, and generalized weakness and fatigue. His blood work shows further elevation in his creatinine levels and a decrease in his eGFR, indicating worsening kidney function.

To manage his acute renal failure, John Doe is started on intravenous fluids to support his kidney function and improve blood flow to his kidneys. He is closely monitored for any electrolyte imbalances and treated accordingly. The surgical team also adjusts his medications, including temporarily stopping certain medications that may further harm his kidneys.

Post-operative care involves close monitoring of his kidney function and gradual improvement of his renal function over time. The medical team emphasizes the importance of maintaining good hydration and monitoring blood pressure control to prevent further kidney damage.

John Doe's prognosis for recovery from acute renal failure will depend on the severity and duration of his kidney injury, as well as the overall management and treatment provided. It is crucial to optimize his medical conditions, including his hypertension and diabetes, to prevent long-term complications and improve his overall kidney function. Regular follow-up appointments and close monitoring will be necessary to ensure his continued recovery.
