The patient is a 45-year-old female who is scheduled to undergo surgery.

She has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia.

Her hypertension is well-controlled with lisinopril 10mg once daily.

Her diabetes is managed with metformin 1000mg twice daily and she has a current HbA1c of 6.5%.

Her hyperlipidemia is treated with atorvastatin 20mg once daily and her lipid levels are within target.

She has a BMI of 28, indicating she is overweight.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy 10 years ago and an appendectomy 5 years ago, both of which were uncomplicated.

She has no known drug allergies.

Preoperatively, she was instructed to stop taking metformin 48 hours before the surgery, but to continue all other medications.

During the surgery, the patient experienced hypotension which was managed with fluid resuscitation and administration of vasopressors.

Following the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, characterized by an abrupt decline in kidney function.

She was started on IV fluids and her medications were adjusted to avoid further damage to her kidneys.

Urine output was closely monitored and laboratory tests including creatinine and BUN were ordered daily.

The patient was also placed on renal precautions, with strict monitoring of her volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications.

The cause of the acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, with hypotension during surgery and the underlying comorbidities playing a role.

The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next few days and she was discharged from the hospital with close follow-up.
