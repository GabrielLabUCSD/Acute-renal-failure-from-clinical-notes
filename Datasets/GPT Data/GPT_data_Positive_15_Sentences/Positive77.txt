The patient is a 60-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. His blood pressure has been well controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 10 years ago and has been managed with oral medications, including metformin. His most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 7.5%, indicating fair control of his blood glucose levels.

He has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 5 years ago. He denies any respiratory symptoms or a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The patient's body mass index is 32, indicating obesity. He has attempted weight loss in the past through diet and exercise, but has been unable to achieve significant sustained weight loss.

In terms of surgical history, the patient underwent an appendectomy 20 years ago without any complications. He has never had any prior anesthesia complications or difficulty with intubation.

Lab results from his preoperative workup are significant for mild renal insufficiency, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 58 mL/min/1.73m2.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

During the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure, with a significant increase in his creatinine level to 2.5 mg/dL and a decrease in his urine output. He develops oliguria and demonstrates signs of fluid overload, including peripheral edema and increased blood pressure.

An ultrasound of the kidneys reveals no obstruction, suggesting that the acute renal failure is most likely due to prerenal causes. The patient is managed with fluid restriction, diuretics, and close monitoring of his renal function.

His renal function gradually improves over the next few days, with a decrease in his creatinine level to 1.5 mg/dL and an increase in his urine output. He is closely monitored for signs of further renal complications, such as electrolyte abnormalities or metabolic acidosis.

The patient's hernia repair surgery is successfully completed without any intraoperative complications. He is discharged from the hospital with close follow-up arranged to monitor his renal function and manage his chronic medical conditions. Special attention is given to optimizing his blood pressure and blood glucose control to prevent any further complications.
