The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. His diabetes is well-controlled with oral medications, and he has not had any recent complications related to his condition. His blood pressure is also well-managed with medication, and he has had no episodes of hypertensive crisis. His cholesterol levels have been within the normal range with the help of statin therapy.

The patient does not have any known drug allergies and has not experienced any adverse reactions to anesthesia in the past. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. He exercises regularly and maintains a healthy diet. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 26, indicating he is slightly overweight but not obese.

During the pre-operative evaluation, the patient's laboratory tests revealed that he has mild kidney dysfunction, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. However, his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is still within normal limits. The patient has not experienced any symptoms of acute kidney injury or renal failure prior to the surgery, such as changes in urine output or appearance.

After the surgery, the patient developed complications and was diagnosed with acute renal failure. His creatinine levels rapidly increased to 4.2 mg/dL, and his eGFR dropped significantly. He experienced oliguria, with a urine output of less than 400 mL per day, and developed electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia. The patient required hemodialysis for renal support to manage his worsening renal function.

Further investigations revealed that the acute renal failure was likely due to acute tubular necrosis, possibly caused by a combination of ischemia and nephrotoxic agents administered during surgery. The patient's fluid management was carefully monitored, and efforts were made to optimize renal perfusion during the surgical procedure, but it seems that his kidneys were still vulnerable to injury.

The patient was administered appropriate fluids and medications, including diuretic therapy, to promote renal recovery and manage his electrolyte imbalances. He underwent daily dialysis sessions until his kidney function began to improve gradually. The patient's cardiovascular function remained stable, and he did not experience any severe complications related to his renal failure.

It is important to note that the patient's pre-operative kidney dysfunction was a risk factor for the development of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function, fluid management, and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents is crucial in patients with underlying kidney disease undergoing surgical procedures to prevent such complications. The patient will require regular follow-up to monitor his kidney function and ensure appropriate management of his chronic conditions, especially his diabetes and hypertension.
