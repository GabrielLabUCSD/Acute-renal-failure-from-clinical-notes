The patient is a 60-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for an appendectomy. He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been taking medication for these conditions, including antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemics, and statins. He denies any previous surgeries or major illnesses.

The patient had a preoperative evaluation which included a physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. His blood pressure was well-controlled, with a reading of 130/80 mmHg. His blood glucose level was slightly elevated at 160 mg/dL, but his hemoglobin A1c was within the target range at 7%.

Laboratory tests revealed elevated cholesterol levels, with a total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol of 160 mg/dL. Kidney function tests were within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Electrolyte levels and liver function tests were also within normal ranges.

The patient was advised to continue taking his antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemics, and statins up until the day of surgery. He was also instructed to fast starting at midnight before the surgery and to avoid eating or drinking anything, including water, during this time.

The patient underwent surgery, which was uneventful. However, postoperatively, he developed acute renal failure due to a combination of factors including intraoperative hypotension, dehydration, and the use of nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

His urine output decreased significantly, and his serum creatinine level rose to 2.5 mg/dL. This was accompanied by electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and diuretics to improve renal perfusion and increase urine production.

Close monitoring of the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels was done. The patient's fluid intake and output were closely monitored to prevent further dehydration. The use of nephrotoxic medications was discontinued, and alternative pain management strategies were implemented.

With supportive care and close monitoring, the patient's renal function gradually improved. His urine output increased, and his serum creatinine level decreased over the course of a few days. His electrolyte imbalances were corrected as well.

The patient was discharged from the hospital in stable condition with instructions to continue taking his medications and to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his chronic medical conditions and postoperative recovery. He was advised to maintain good hydration and to avoid nephrotoxic medications in the future.
