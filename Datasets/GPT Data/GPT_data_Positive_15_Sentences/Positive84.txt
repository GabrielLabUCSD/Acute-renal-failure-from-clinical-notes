The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. Mr. Smith was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and is currently on medication to control his blood pressure.

He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 five years ago and is managing his condition through dietary modifications and oral antidiabetic medications. His blood sugar levels are generally well controlled. 

Mr. Smith also has hyperlipidemia, with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol. He takes statin medication to manage his cholesterol levels, and regular blood tests indicate that his lipid profile is within the target range.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed six years ago due to gallstones. The surgery went well, and there were no complications. 

Mr. Smith does not have any known drug allergies and is not currently taking any medications other than those mentioned above. He has never smoked and consumes alcohol occasionally in moderation.

During the preoperative evaluation, it was discovered that Mr. Smith's kidney function is mildly compromised, with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 58 mL/min/1.73mÂ². This indicates a mild decrease in kidney function but not severe enough to warrant any specific treatment at this time.

After the surgery, Mr. Smith developed acute renal failure, characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function. This was likely caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys during the surgical procedure. 

Acute renal failure is classified into three stages: prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. The exact stage of renal failure in Mr. Smith's case would need further investigation.

Symptoms of acute renal failure may include decreased urine output, fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and fatigue. Mr. Smith's medical team is closely monitoring his kidney function and managing his symptoms through fluid management, electrolyte adjustments, and medication.

The prognosis for acute renal failure depends on the underlying cause, the patient's overall health, and the timeliness of intervention. With appropriate management and treatment, it is possible for Mr. Smith's kidney function to recover to some extent.

The surgical team is working to optimize Mr. Smith's condition before considering any further interventions. The patient's family has been informed about the situation, and emotional support is being provided to them.
