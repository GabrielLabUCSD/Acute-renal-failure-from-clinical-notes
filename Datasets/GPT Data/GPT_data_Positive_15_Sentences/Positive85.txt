The patient is a 55-year-old man who is planning to have surgery for a hip replacement. He has a past medical history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He has no known medication allergies. His family history is significant for heart disease, with his father having a heart attack in his 60s.

The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol regularly. He maintains a healthy lifestyle, exercises regularly, and follows a balanced diet. He has no history of respiratory conditions or diabetes.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had a cholecystectomy 10 years ago for gallstones, and he had no postoperative complications. He has not had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations since then.

During preoperative testing, the patient's complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function were within normal limits. He has also undergone an EKG, which showed a normal sinus rhythm and no signs of cardiac abnormalities.

Following the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure as a complication. This was characterized by a sudden decline in his kidney function, resulting in decreased urine output and an increase in serum creatinine levels. The cause of the renal failure is uncertain, but it may be related to the anesthesia, surgery, or possibly an underlying renal condition.

The patient was promptly started on intravenous fluid therapy to maintain his hydration and blood pressure. He was also given diuretics to help improve urine output and encourage renal function. Close monitoring of his renal function and electrolyte levels was initiated.

In addition, the patient's medications were adjusted to avoid any potential nephrotoxicity and ensure optimal renal perfusion. He was closely followed by a nephrologist who provided consultation and recommendations for his management.

Over time, the patient's renal function gradually improved, with steady increases in urine output and a decline in serum creatinine levels. He was discharged from the hospital after a week and provided with instructions for follow-up care.

During the follow-up visits, the patient's renal function continued to improve, and his creatinine levels returned to baseline. He was advised to undergo regular renal function monitoring and to address any new concerns promptly.

Overall, the patient experienced a complication of acute renal failure following surgery but responded well to appropriate management. His surgical history, well-controlled hypertension, and adherence to a healthy lifestyle were contributing factors to his favorable outcome.
