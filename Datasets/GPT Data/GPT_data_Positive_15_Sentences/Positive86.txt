The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a medical history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity. He has been taking medication for his blood pressure and cholesterol for the past 10 years. The patient has a BMI of 35 and has struggled with weight management for several years.

In addition to his chronic health conditions, the patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 60. The patient does not smoke but admits to occasionally drinking alcohol. He exercises sporadically and has a sedentary lifestyle due to his office job.

The patient has undergone a pre-operative evaluation, including blood work and an electrocardiogram, which were within normal limits. However, his kidney function tests showed elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating impaired renal function.

The patient's medical team suspects acute renal failure as a complication after surgery, which is a condition characterized by a sudden loss of kidney function. This may be attributed to multiple factors, including prolonged anesthesia, hypotension during surgery, and the use of certain medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or contrast agents.

To monitor his kidneys during surgery, the patient will have a urinary catheter inserted to measure urine output. The medical team will also closely monitor his fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as his kidney function through frequent blood tests.

Postoperatively, the patient will require careful management of his renal function, including close monitoring of creatinine and BUN levels, as well as daily urine output. He may require fluid restriction and the administration of diuretics to support kidney function.

The patient will also be educated on the importance of staying well-hydrated, avoiding medications that may further compromise renal function, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent future complications.

Given his medical history and the potential risk of postoperative acute renal failure, the patient's surgical team will take extra precautions during and after the procedure, including close monitoring, adjusting medication dosages, and providing adequate postoperative renal care.
