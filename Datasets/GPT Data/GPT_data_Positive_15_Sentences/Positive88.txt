The patient is a 57-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. The patient has been on medications for his hypertension, including amlodipine and lisinopril, which have been well-controlled. His diabetes is also managed with metformin and diet modification.

The patient has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination is unremarkable, except for the hernia.

Lab work shows a fasting blood glucose level of 130 mg/dL, which is within his usual range. His hemoglobin A1c is 6.7%, indicating fair control of his diabetes. His renal function tests are normal, with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >90 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient underwent the hernia repair surgery as planned. However, on postoperative day 2, he developed acute renal failure, characterized by a sudden drop in his urine output and an increase in his serum creatinine level to 2.5 mg/dL. This was accompanied by fluid overload symptoms, such as edema and shortness of breath.

Further workup revealed that the patient had acute tubular necrosis, which is the most common cause of acute renal failure after surgery. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including perioperative hypotension, prolonged surgery duration, and possible exposure to nephrotoxic medications.

The patient was started on intravenous fluids and closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances and volume overload. His renal function slowly improved over the next few days, with a decrease in his serum creatinine level to 1.2 mg/dL.

During his hospital stay, the patient received regular hemodialysis sessions to support his renal function and remove accumulated waste products. He also underwent extensive fluid management to achieve euvolemia.

After a week of treatment, the patient's renal function significantly improved, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a urine output within normal limits. He was eventually discharged with close follow-up with his primary care physician and nephrologist.

In summary, this patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity underwent a hernia repair surgery and subsequently developed acute renal failure. This was likely due to acute tubular necrosis, a common complication after surgery. With prompt and appropriate treatment, the patient's renal function gradually improved, and he was discharged with close monitoring.
