The patient, a 55-year-old male named John, is planning to undergo surgery for an elective knee replacement. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. John has been on medications including metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin for several years to manage these conditions.

John's blood pressure has been well controlled with his current medication regimen. His diabetes is also well controlled, with his most recent HbA1c level at 6.5%. He has no history of any complications related to his diabetes, such as retinopathy or neuropathy. His lipid levels have also been well managed on statin therapy, with his most recent cholesterol levels within normal limits.

John has no known drug allergies and does not smoke or consume alcohol. He exercises regularly and maintains a healthy diet. His weight and BMI are within normal limits.

In preparation for surgery, John underwent routine preoperative assessment, which included a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and coagulation profile. These investigations revealed no abnormalities, suggesting that he is in good overall health.

During surgery, John experienced acute renal failure as a complication. Post-operative investigations revealed elevated serum creatinine levels, reduced urine output, and electrolyte imbalances consistent with acute kidney injury. He was promptly started on intravenous fluids and monitored closely.

The etiology of his acute renal failure is believed to be multifactorial, likely due to a combination of factors including prolonged surgical time, hypotension during surgery, and possible exposure to nephrotoxic medications.

John's renal function is being continuously monitored, and he is receiving appropriate management for his acute renal failure, including diuretics and electrolyte replacement therapy. His urine output has gradually improved, and his serum creatinine levels have started to trend downwards, suggesting renal recovery.

Multidisciplinary involvement, including the nephrology and surgical teams, is being sought to ensure optimal management of his condition. A renal ultrasound has been planned to evaluate for any structural abnormalities.

In summary, John is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia, preparing for knee replacement surgery. He experienced acute renal failure as a post-operative complication, which is being managed proactively.
