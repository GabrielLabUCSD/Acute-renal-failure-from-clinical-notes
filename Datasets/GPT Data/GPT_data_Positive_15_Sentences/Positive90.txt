Patient X, a 55-year-old male, with a history of hypertension and diabetes, is scheduled to undergo surgery for an elective procedure. He has been on medication to control his blood pressure, including ACE inhibitors, and take insulin injections for his diabetes.

Patient X has a BMI of 32, indicating he is overweight. He reports occasional shortness of breath but denies any significant respiratory conditions. He has been a non-smoker for the past 10 years.

His past surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and hernia repair surgeries performed five years ago. He tolerated both procedures well without any complications.

Patient X's latest laboratory results show a well-controlled blood glucose level with an HbA1c of 7.2%. However, he has a moderate proteinuria of 300mg/dL and microalbuminuria, indicating early signs of diabetic nephropathy.

His renal function tests reveal a baseline creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 65 mL/min/1.73 mÂ². These results suggest that he has mild renal impairment, but within the normal range for his age.

The patient currently takes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for his hypertension, and his blood pressure is well-controlled, with readings averaging 130/80 mmHg.

Patient X reports no known drug allergies and has no history of adverse reactions to anesthesia. It is important to note that he has been compliant with his medications and has regular follow-ups with his primary care physician.

During the surgery, Patient X develops acute renal failure postoperatively, characterized by oliguria, elevated creatinine levels, and reduced urine output. This complication is likely due to decreased renal perfusion, possibly caused by hypotension during the procedure.

In order to address the acute renal failure, the medical team initiates fluid resuscitation, closely monitors the patient's hemodynamics, and adjusts blood pressure management to optimize renal perfusion.

Patient X's care plan involves maintaining strict glycemic control, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and closely monitoring kidney function following the surgery. A nephrologist will be consulted for further evaluation and management.

It is crucial to monitor his renal function closely as the acute renal failure can worsen and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately. Patient X will receive adequate follow-up care and regular monitoring to ensure his kidneys recover fully.
