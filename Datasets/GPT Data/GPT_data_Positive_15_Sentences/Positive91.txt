The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He has been managing his conditions with medication for the past 10 years. 
He presented to the hospital with complaints of severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed with acute appendicitis. It was decided that he would undergo an appendectomy. 
His preoperative labs showed well-controlled blood glucose levels and his blood pressure was within normal limits. 
He underwent surgery without any complications and the appendectomy was successful. 
However, postoperatively, he developed acute renal failure. 
The patient's urine output decreased significantly and his creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were elevated. 
He was started on hemodialysis to support his kidney function. 
The patient had no known history of renal disease or previous kidney injury. 
Further investigations were done to determine the cause of his acute renal failure, including ruling out any medication toxicity. 
It was concluded that the acute renal failure was most likely a result of intraoperative hypotension and decreased renal perfusion. 
The patient's blood pressure was not well-maintained during the surgery and he experienced a period of low blood pressure. 
Immediate interventions were initiated to support his renal function and prevent further complications. 
He was closely monitored for fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and renal function. 
The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next week and he was able to discontinue hemodialysis. 
He was discharged from the hospital with instructions for follow-up appointments with a nephrologist. 
The patient was educated on the importance of maintaining blood pressure control and monitoring his renal function regularly.
