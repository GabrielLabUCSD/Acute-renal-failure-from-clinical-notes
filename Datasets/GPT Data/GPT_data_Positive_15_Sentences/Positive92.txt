The patient is a 55-year-old female who is planning to have surgery for a gallbladder removal. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which are well controlled with medications.

Her blood pressure is currently well managed on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She takes atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and metformin for diabetes.

The patient has no known allergies to medications, and her previous surgeries include a cesarean section and an appendectomy with no complications.

She has never smoked and does not consume alcohol. Her family history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Additionally, the patient reports no current symptoms related to her gallbladder, but her surgeon recommends the procedure due to frequent episodes of abdominal pain and the presence of gallstones on imaging.

During surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure as a complication. This was likely due to decreased kidney perfusion secondary to the procedure. She presented with an abrupt decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine levels.

The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids to optimize her fluid balance and improve kidney function. A nephrologist was consulted, and the patient underwent further evaluation including urinalysis, blood tests, and a renal ultrasound.

The cause of her acute renal failure was determined to be hypovolemia and intraoperative hypotension. There were no signs of infection or obstructive uropathy.

The patient's renal function gradually improved with supportive management, including close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance. She was gradually weaned off intravenous fluids and started on oral fluids. The nephrologist recommended avoiding nephrotoxic medications during her recovery.

The patient's postoperative course was otherwise unremarkable. She had an uneventful recovery from her gallbladder removal surgery and was discharged home in stable condition. She was scheduled for follow-up with both her surgeon and nephrologist to monitor her renal function in the coming weeks.
