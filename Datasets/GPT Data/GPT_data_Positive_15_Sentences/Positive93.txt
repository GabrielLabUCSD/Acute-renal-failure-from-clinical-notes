The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. His hypertension is well-controlled with medication, but his diabetes is managed with oral antidiabetic drugs. The patient has a history of smoking and is a former heavy drinker.

On physical examination, the patient has a body mass index of 30, indicating obesity. The patient has mild pedal edema, but there are no signs of fluid overload. Laboratory tests reveal elevated creatinine levels, consistent with his chronic kidney disease. His glycemic control is fair, with a hemoglobin A1c level of 7.2%.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy 10 years ago and a cholecystectomy 5 years ago. He has had no complications or significant bleeding during these procedures.

The patient is currently taking lisinopril for his hypertension, metformin for his diabetes, and simvastatin for dyslipidemia. He understands the need to discontinue metformin prior to surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis.

During the surgery, the patient experiences hypotension and requires intravenous fluids and vasoactive medications. Despite these interventions, the patient develops acute renal failure, characterized by a sudden decrease in urine output and elevated serum creatinine levels.

The patient is diagnosed with postoperative acute renal failure, likely due to perioperative hemodynamic instability and potential nephrotoxic effects of anesthesia. He is started on continuous renal replacement therapy to support kidney function and manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's condition gradually improves over the course of several days, with a gradual increase in urine output and a decrease in serum creatinine levels. His renal function stabilizes, and he is able to discontinue renal replacement therapy.

The patient is closely monitored for any signs of infection, electrolyte imbalances, or further renal complications. He is educated on the importance of lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and moderating alcohol intake, to improve his overall health and reduce the risk of future surgical complications.

Overall, the patient has a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease stage 3, which increases his risk of perioperative complications. While he does experience acute renal failure postoperatively, his condition gradually improves with appropriate management and support. With ongoing medical care and lifestyle changes, the patient can minimize the risk of further complications in the future.
