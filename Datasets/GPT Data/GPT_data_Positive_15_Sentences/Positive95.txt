The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hip replacement. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well-controlled with metformin. He does not have a history of any major surgical procedures or known drug allergies.

The patient has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years, including amlodipine and lisinopril. His blood pressure has been well controlled with these medications, with readings consistently around 120/70 mmHg. He has never had any complications related to his blood pressure or any major cardiovascular events.

In terms of his lipid profile, the patient's most recent lipid panel showed normal levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. He has been on atorvastatin for the past 5 years, and his adherence to medication has been excellent.

The patient's diabetes is managed with lifestyle modifications and metformin, which he takes consistently. He monitors his blood glucose levels regularly and has achieved good glycemic control, with HbA1c levels consistently below 7%.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient currently smokes 10 cigarettes per day. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years and has attempted to quit on multiple occasions but has not been successful. He is aware of the risks associated with smoking and is motivated to quit.

The patient's preoperative laboratory workup revealed normal renal function and no signs of electrolyte imbalances. His creatinine clearance was 80 ml/min, and his urine output was within normal limits. He has no previous history of kidney disease or renal dysfunction.

After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, with a sudden decrease in urinary output and an increase in serum creatinine levels. His urine output dropped to less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour, and his creatinine levels rose from a baseline of 0.8 mg/dL to 2.5 mg/dL.

The patient's other clinical findings included electrolyte imbalances, with elevated potassium levels and metabolic acidosis. His arterial blood gas analysis showed low pH, low bicarbonate levels, and low pCO2, indicating respiratory compensation for the acidosis.

Management of the patient's acute renal failure involved discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). He was started on intravenous fluids and diuretics to improve urine output. Additionally, he required dialysis to remove toxins and correct the electrolyte imbalances.

Further investigation revealed that the acute renal failure was most likely caused by acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypotension during the surgery. The patient did not have any pre-existing kidney disease, and his renal function was normal prior to the surgery.

Overall, the patient's surgical history includes a hip replacement procedure and subsequent development of acute renal failure. With appropriate management and dialysis support, his renal function gradually improved, and he was eventually able to discontinue dialysis. Long-term follow-up will be important to monitor for any residual kidney damage or complications.
