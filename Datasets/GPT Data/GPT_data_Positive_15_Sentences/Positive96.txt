The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The patient has been managing his hypertension with a combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors for the past five years. His blood pressure has been relatively well controlled with this regimen. The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago and has been managing his blood glucose levels with oral antidiabetic medications. He has been advised to stop these medications prior to surgery and will receive insulin therapy during his hospital stay.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy ten years ago and an appendectomy twenty years ago. Both surgeries were uneventful. He has no known drug allergies. The patient does not smoke or consume alcohol. However, it should be noted that he is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 35. This may increase his risk for surgical complications, such as wound infection and delayed healing.

The patient's pre-operative laboratory results show relatively normal values. His complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL, within normal limits. His platelet count and white blood cell count are also within normal ranges. However, his renal function tests indicate mild renal impairment with a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 mL/min/1.73mÂ². This may suggest underlying chronic kidney disease.

Post-surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure, evidenced by a rapid increase in serum creatinine levels to 3.5 mg/dL and decrease in urine output. This is likely a result of complications such as hypotension during surgery, decreased renal blood flow, or use of nephrotoxic medications. The patient is stable hemodynamically and does not require dialysis at this time. He will be closely monitored for any further decline in renal function or signs of fluid overload. The surgical team will collaborate with the nephrology team to adjust medications and manage the acute renal failure.

Overall, this patient is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair with a complex medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Pre-operative laboratory results demonstrate mild renal impairment, and post-surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure. It is important to closely monitor the patient's renal function and manage any potential complications to optimize his post-surgical recovery.
