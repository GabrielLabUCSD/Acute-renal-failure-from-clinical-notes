The patient is a 54-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for the removal of a tumor in his abdomen. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with these conditions several years ago and has been managing them with medications.

The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. He exercises regularly and follows a healthy diet. His blood pressure has been well controlled with a combination of antihypertensive medications, including ACE inhibitors and diuretics.

His diabetes is managed with oral medications, including metformin and a sulfonylurea. He monitors his blood glucose levels regularly and has maintained good control over his blood sugar levels.

His cholesterol levels are also well controlled with the use of statin medication. He has been taking a low-dose statin for the past five years and has had no reported side effects.

In preparation for the surgery, the patient underwent various preoperative examinations and tests, including an EKG, chest x-ray, and blood work. His baseline kidney function was within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 80 mL/min/1.73m2.

Unfortunately, after the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure. He experienced a sudden decline in his kidney function, with a marked increase in his serum creatinine level to 3.2 mg/dL and a decrease in his eGFR to 30 mL/min/1.73m2.

The patient presented with symptoms such as decreased urine output, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances. He required urgent intervention, including intravenous fluids, diuretics, and electrolyte replacement therapy.

Further investigations revealed that the cause of his acute renal failure was related to acute tubular necrosis as a result of prolonged intraoperative hypotension and ischemia. The patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during surgery, which compromised blood flow to his kidneys.

The patient is currently under close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team, including nephrologists and surgeons. They are closely managing his fluid balance, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels. Salvaging his kidney function is the primary goal at this stage.

The patient's diabetes and hypertension management have been adjusted to support his renal function. He has made appropriate dietary modifications, including a low-sodium and low-protein diet.

The multidisciplinary team is also working on formulating a plan for renal replacement therapy options, considering the possibility of dialysis in the future. The patient is being educated about the importance of compliance with his prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications, as this will be crucial to preserving his kidney function and preventing further complications.
