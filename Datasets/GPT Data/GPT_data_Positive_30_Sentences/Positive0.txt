The patient is a 63-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for the removal of a benign tumor in his abdomen. He has a medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The patient has been taking medication for his hypertension for the past 10 years and has been able to keep his blood pressure under control. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 5 years ago, which is managed with oral medication and dietary modifications.

The patient has a history of smoking, but he quit 2 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally, but not excessively. The patient does not have any known drug allergies and has never had any adverse reactions to anesthesia in the past. He has undergone surgery once before, a knee replacement surgery 15 years ago, without any complications.

The patient has had regular check-ups with his primary care physician and has been compliant with all recommendations for preventive care. He has had annual physical exams, including blood pressure monitoring and blood tests to check his cholesterol and blood sugar levels.

The patient's weight has been stable over the past few years, but he is classified as obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. He has been advised by his physicians to lose weight but has struggled to do so. He does not engage in regular exercise, citing lack of time and motivation.

Two weeks after the surgery, the patient begins to experience symptoms of acute renal failure, including decreased urine output, swelling in his legs and ankles, and increased fatigue. He also develops shortness of breath and chest pain. He contacts his surgeon, who advises him to go to the emergency department immediately.

Upon admission to the hospital, the patient's blood tests reveal elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, indicating impaired kidney function. The patient is diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys during surgery.

The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring and initiation of treatment. He receives intravenous fluids to improve his kidney function and diuretics to help increase urine output. The medical team closely monitors his vital signs, urine output, and blood tests to assess his response to treatment.

The patient's blood pressure is managed carefully, as both hypertension and hypotension can exacerbate renal failure. The medical team adjusts his blood pressure medications to maintain a stable blood pressure within a target range.

The patient undergoes additional tests, including a renal ultrasound and CT scan, to determine the underlying cause of his acute renal failure. The results reveal that there is no obstruction or damage to the kidneys, indicating that the renal failure is most likely due to decreased blood flow.

During his hospital stay, the patient is put on a strict renal diet to minimize the workload on his kidneys. He is advised to reduce his intake of protein and sodium. The medical team also closely monitors his fluid balance to prevent fluid overload or dehydration, both of which can further compromise kidney function.

The patient's renal function gradually improves with treatment, and his urine output begins to increase. After a week in the ICU, he is transferred to the general medical ward for further monitoring and management of his renal function. The medical team continues to closely monitor his renal function and adjust his medications as needed.

The patient is provided with education on managing his renal function at home, including proper hydration, medication management, and dietary modifications. He is instructed to follow up with his primary care physician and a nephrologist for ongoing monitoring of his kidney function.

The patient's acute renal failure is considered a complication of his surgery, and steps are taken to prevent future episodes. The medical team takes precautions during subsequent surgeries to ensure adequate blood flow to the kidneys and closely monitor the patient's renal function.

The patient's overall prognosis is good, as his acute renal failure is reversible and was caught early. However, he is now at a higher risk for developing chronic kidney disease, and steps need to be taken to monitor his kidney function closely.

The patient undergoes regular follow-up appointments with his interdisciplinary healthcare team to monitor his renal function and manage his chronic conditions. He is encouraged to make lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and regular exercise, to improve his overall health and reduce his risk of future complications.
