The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to have surgery.
He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and ischemic heart disease.
He has been managing his hypertension with medications for the past 10 years.
His diabetes mellitus type 2 was diagnosed 5 years ago and he is treated with oral hypoglycemic agents.
He had a previous myocardial infarction 10 years ago and underwent coronary angioplasty with stent placement.
He is currently on antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.
The patient denies any history of allergies to medications or food.
He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.
His family history is significant for heart disease, with his father having a heart attack at age 60.
The patient is scheduled to undergo a cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones.
His symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain and bloating after meals.
He has had multiple episodes of biliary colic over the past year.
His abdomen examination is unremarkable except for mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
The patient recently had routine blood work, which revealed normal complete blood count and liver function tests.
His renal function tests showed a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 70 mL/min/1.73m2.
His urine analysis was unremarkable.
The patient is not taking any medications that may affect renal function.
He has no history of urinary tract infections or kidney stones.
Given his stable renal function, the risk of acute renal failure after surgery is low.
However, during the surgery, the patient experienced prolonged hypotension due to intraoperative bleeding.
Postoperatively, the patient developed oliguria and his serum creatinine increased to 2.5 mg/dL.
His urine output was less than 400 mL in 24 hours.
A renal ultrasound was performed and showed normal kidney size and no evidence of obstruction.
The patient's acute renal failure was likely due to ischemic injury to the kidneys following hypotension during surgery.
He was started on intravenous fluids and a loop diuretic to improve renal perfusion and urine output.
The patient underwent daily monitoring of his renal function, fluid status, and electrolytes.
His serum creatinine gradually improved and returned to baseline after one week.
He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician for further renal function monitoring.
