The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for an unresolved hernia issue. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient's hypertension has been well-controlled with a combination of medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic. His diabetes mellitus type 2 has been managed through lifestyle modifications and oral antidiabetic medication. 

He has a history of a myocardial infarction four years ago but has since recovered and has been asymptomatic. The patient does not have any known allergies to medications or previous complications with anesthesia.

His most recent laboratory results show well-controlled blood glucose levels, with a fasting glucose of 110 mg/dL. His lipid profile reveals elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, which have prompted treatment with a statin.

The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. He exercises regularly and maintains a healthy weight. He follows a balanced diet and has no history of drug abuse.

During the pre-operative assessment, the patient's vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate were within normal limits. Physical examination findings were unremarkable, with no signs of infection or any specific surgical risks.

However, during the surgery, the patient experienced complications related to acute renal failure. This complication was characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function, resulting in the accumulation of waste products and fluids in the body.

The etiology of the acute renal failure was attributed to intraoperative hypotension, prolonged surgical time, and the use of nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and certain antibiotics.

Following the diagnosis of acute renal failure, the patient was promptly treated with intravenous fluids, diuretics, and cessation of nephrotoxic medications. He was closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances and renal function.

The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next week, with resolution of acute renal failure. He was discharged with instructions to continue monitoring his renal function through regular follow-up appointments, as well as to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent recurrence of kidney injury.

On discharge, the patient was prescribed medications to manage his hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He was advised to continue his antidiabetic medication and ACE inhibitor, with close monitoring of his blood pressure and glucose levels.

Additionally, the patient was advised to follow a low-sodium and low-cholesterol diet to further control his blood pressure and lipid levels. He was instructed to abstain from NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic medications unless prescribed by a healthcare professional.

The patient was educated about the signs and symptoms of acute renal failure and advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experienced any of these symptoms. He was also counseled on the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and avoiding dehydration.

In summary, a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and a past myocardial infarction is planning to undergo surgery for the resolution of a hernia. During the surgery, he developed acute renal failure as a complication. The episode of acute renal failure was attributed to intraoperative hypotension, prolonged surgical time, and the use of nephrotoxic medications. The patient's renal function gradually improved with appropriate management, and he was discharged with instructions to continue monitoring his renal function and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
