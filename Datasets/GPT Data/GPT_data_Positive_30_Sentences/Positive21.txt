The patient is a 65-year-old male who is preparing to undergo surgery.
He has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.
His blood pressure is well-controlled with medication.
His diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and his blood glucose levels are stable.
The patient has no known allergies to medications.
He has never had any major surgeries in the past.
His current medications include metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and atorvastatin for high cholesterol.
He does not have a history of smoking or alcohol use.
His family history is significant for heart disease, with his father and one sibling both having myocardial infarctions in their 60s.
The patient has recently completed all pre-operative tests, including blood work, ECG, and chest X-ray, which all came back normal.
His physical examination was unremarkable, with no abnormalities detected.
The patient has been counseled on the risks and benefits of surgery, and he has provided informed consent.
He has been instructed to stop taking his metformin and atorvastatin one week before surgery.
The patient will need to fast for 8 hours before surgery.
He has been advised to take his lisinopril on the morning of surgery with a small sip of water.
The patient will be kept nil by mouth after surgery until bowel sounds return and he is able to tolerate oral intake.
During surgery, the patient will be intubated and placed under general anesthesia.
He will have a urinary catheter inserted to monitor urine output during and after surgery.
After surgery, the patient will be closely monitored for complications such as bleeding, infection, and thrombosis.
He will be started on prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection.
The patient has been educated about post-operative pain management and will be given analgesics as needed.
He has been advised to ambulate as soon as possible after surgery to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis.
The patient's surgical site will be assessed regularly for signs of infection or poor healing.
He will receive physical therapy to aid in his recovery and regain mobility.
Unfortunately, the patient developed acute renal failure post-operatively.
He experienced a sudden decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine levels.
The patient's urine was also noted to have a dark color and a strong odor.
After further evaluation, it was determined that the acute renal failure was likely due to post-operative hypotension and decreased perfusion to the kidneys.
The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids to restore his fluid balance and improve renal function.
He was also started on medications to promote diuresis and support renal function.
The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next few days and he was eventually able to be discharged from the hospital with close outpatient follow-up.
