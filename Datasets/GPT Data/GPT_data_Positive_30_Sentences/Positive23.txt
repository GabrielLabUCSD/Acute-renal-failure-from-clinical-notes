His blood work shows normal levels of all major organ functions.
His X-rays reveal severe degeneration in the knee joint, confirming the need for surgery.
The patient has been provided with detailed instructions regarding pre-operative preparations, including fasting guidelines.
The surgery is scheduled to take place in two weeks.
