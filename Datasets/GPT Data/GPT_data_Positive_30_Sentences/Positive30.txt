The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] who is planning to have [type of surgery]. Their medical history includes various previous surgeries, including [list of previous surgeries]. They have a history of [specific medical conditions or diseases], which are being managed with [list of medications or treatments].

The patient has a known allergy to [specific allergen]. They also have a family history of [specific medical conditions], including [list of family medical history]. Their social history reveals that they are a non-smoker and do not consume alcohol or illicit substances.

In terms of their current health status, the patient is generally in good overall health. They are experiencing [specific symptoms], which have led to the decision to undergo surgery. Their vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, are within normal limits.

The patient's lab results show that they have normal complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and electrolyte levels. However, they have a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of [number]. It is important to closely monitor their renal function during and after surgery.

During the surgery, the patient is placed under general anesthesia and is closely monitored by an anesthesiologist. The procedure is performed successfully, with no major complications reported.

Following the surgery, however, the patient develops acute renal failure (ARF), characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function. Symptoms of ARF include decreased urine output, fluid retention, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's renal function worsens as evident by the elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

The patient is promptly treated by the medical team, who initiate measures to support kidney function and manage fluid and electrolyte balance. They are administered intravenous fluids and diuretic medications to promote urine production and excretion of waste products.

The medical team closely monitors the patient's renal function through daily blood tests, including serum creatinine and BUN levels. They also monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent complications associated with ARF, such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's ARF gradually improves with the treatment. Their urine output increases, and their renal function shows signs of recovery, as evidenced by the decreasing levels of creatinine and BUN. The patient is closely monitored for any signs of complications, such as infection or further decline in renal function.

In addition to the management of ARF, the patient receives appropriate pain management to ensure their comfort during the recovery period. They are encouraged to ambulate and participate in physical therapy as tolerated to promote a speedy recovery.

The patient's overall post-operative recovery is satisfactory, with no signs of further complications. They are discharged from the hospital after the healthcare team ensures their renal function has returned to baseline. The patient is prescribed medications to manage any residual pain and is advised to follow up with their primary care physician for further monitoring of their renal function.

It is essential for the patient to closely adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and follow any lifestyle modifications recommended by their healthcare providers. Lifestyle changes may include maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding behaviors that may further compromise their renal function.

The medical team emphasizes the importance of regular follow-up appointments to assess the patient's renal function and monitor for any potential complications related to the ARF. Long-term management strategies will be developed based on the patient's individual needs and the underlying cause of their ARF.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was complicated by the development of acute renal failure post-operatively. However, with timely intervention and appropriate management, their renal function improved, and they had a successful recovery.
