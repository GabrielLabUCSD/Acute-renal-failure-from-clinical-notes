The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's blood pressure has been well controlled on medication, and his diabetes is managed with diet and exercise.

The patient has a history of smoking but quit three years ago. He has a BMI of 32, indicating obesity. The patient does not have any known drug allergies.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone an appendectomy and a hernia repair surgery. There were no complications during these procedures, and the patient recovered well.

The patient currently takes several medications, including lisinopril for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He has been compliant with his medications and has not experienced any adverse effects.

Lab results show that the patient has a normal complete blood count and liver function tests. However, his fasting blood glucose levels are slightly elevated, and his HbA1c indicates uncontrolled diabetes. His lipid profile reveals elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

The patient's preoperative evaluation reveals that he is otherwise healthy and suitable for surgery. His lung examination is clear, and he has normal heart sounds. His electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities.

The patient's renal function tests indicate normal kidney function, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 15 mg/dL. His urinalysis is also within normal limits.

During the surgery, the patient experiences prolonged hypotension, leading to a decrease in renal perfusion. Postoperatively, the patient develops acute renal failure as a complication. He presents with oliguria, elevated serum creatinine (2.5 mg/dL), and increased blood urea nitrogen (40 mg/dL).

Further investigations reveal that the patient's kidneys are not responding to diuretics, and his urine output remains low despite adequate hydration. He undergoes a renal ultrasound, which shows normal kidney size and no structural abnormalities.

The patient is diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis, a common cause of acute renal failure post-surgery. The condition is likely due to ischemia-reperfusion injury during the prolonged hypotension episode during surgery.

Treatment for the patient's acute renal failure involves fluid resuscitation and close monitoring of electrolytes. He is started on continuous renal replacement therapy to support his kidney function and remove metabolic waste products.

The patient's condition gradually improves over the next few days. His urine output begins to increase, and his serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels start to decrease.

The patient is also closely monitored for any signs of infection, as urinary tract infections can further complicate acute renal failure. He is placed on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent any secondary infections.

In addition to the acute renal failure, the patient also develops postoperative complications such as wound infections and atelectasis. These are managed with antibiotics and physiotherapy, respectively.

The patient's diabetes management is optimized during his hospital stay. Insulin therapy is initiated to achieve better glycemic control, and dietary consultations are provided to educate the patient about healthy eating habits.

The patient is also advised to quit smoking permanently to reduce the risk of future surgical complications and to improve overall health outcomes.

The patient's renal function gradually improves over the course of his hospital stay, and he is eventually discharged with close follow-up with his primary care physician.

He is advised to continue taking his medications for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and a healthy diet, are strongly emphasized to manage his chronic conditions and reduce his risk of future surgical complications.
