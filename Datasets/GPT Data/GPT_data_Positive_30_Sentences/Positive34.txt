The patient's surgical complication, acute renal failure, occurred after the surgery. The following details describe this condition:

8. [Definition]: Acute renal failure, also known as acute kidney injury, is a sudden loss of kidney function that occurs within a short period. It can lead to an accumulation of waste products and fluids in the body.

9. [Causes]: Acute renal failure can be caused by various factors, such as decreased blood flow to the kidneys, blockage in the urinary tract, or direct damage to the kidneys.

10. [Symptoms]: Symptoms of acute renal failure may include decreased urine output, fluid retention, fatigue, confusion, nausea, and swelling in the legs and ankles.

11. [Diagnosis]: Acute renal failure is diagnosed through blood tests, urine tests, imaging studies, and a review of the patient's medical history.

12. [Treatment]: Treatment for acute renal failure aims to address the underlying cause and improve kidney function. This may involve medication, diet changes, fluid management, and in severe cases, dialysis.

13. [Prognosis]: The prognosis for acute renal failure depends on the underlying cause and the patient's overall health. With prompt and appropriate treatment, many cases can be reversed, and kidney function can be restored.

14. [Complications]: Complications of acute renal failure may include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and damage to other organs.

15. [Prevention]: Preventive measures for acute renal failure include maintaining proper hydration, avoiding medications that can harm the kidneys, and managing underlying medical conditions.

16. [Hospitalization]: The patient was admitted to the hospital post-surgery due to the development of acute renal failure. They were closely monitored by the medical team and received appropriate interventions.

17. [Fluid management]: The patient received intravenous fluids to maintain adequate hydration and support kidney function.

18. [Medications]: The patient was prescribed medications to manage their condition and support renal recovery. This may include diuretics, electrolyte supplements, and medication to address the underlying cause.

19. [Dialysis]: In severe cases, the patient may have required dialysis to assist in removing waste products and excess fluid from their blood.

20. [Complications]: The patient experienced complications related to acute renal failure, including electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

21. [Management of complications]: The medical team closely monitored the patient's electrolyte levels, adjusted medications as necessary, and provided appropriate interventions to address fluid overload.

22. [Consultations]: The patient was referred to a nephrologist and involved in the care of a multidisciplinary team, including specialists in urology, anesthesia, and critical care.

23. [Monitoring]: The patient's kidney function, urine output, electrolyte levels, and general well-being were closely monitored during their hospital stay.

24. [Recovery]: The patient demonstrated signs of kidney function improvement during their hospitalization. Their urine output increased, and laboratory values showed improvement.

25. [Discharge]: The patient was discharged from the hospital with appropriate follow-up appointments scheduled to monitor their renal recovery and overall health.

26. [Instructions]: The patient was provided with personalized discharge instructions, including medications, dietary recommendations, and signs to watch for that may indicate a decline in kidney function.

27. [Education]: The patient and their family were educated about the importance of continued medication compliance, adherence to dietary restrictions, and the need for ongoing follow-up care.

28. [Supportive care]: The patient received support from the medical team, including nutrition counseling, social work services, and access to resources for managing their condition.

29. [Allergies]: The patient was not found to have any allergies to the medications used during their treatment for acute renal failure.

30. [Follow-up]: The patient was advised to follow up regularly with their primary care physician and specialists to monitor their overall health and manage any ongoing concerns related to their medical history and the complications of acute renal failure.
