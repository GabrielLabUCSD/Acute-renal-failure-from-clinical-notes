Patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient has a history of smoking for over 20 years and has recently quit.

He presents with complaints of severe knee pain and difficulty walking.

After a thorough evaluation, it is determined that the patient requires surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee.

Before the surgery, the patient undergoes a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, which includes blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a chest x-ray.

The patient's blood tests reveal elevated levels of blood glucose, indicating poorly controlled diabetes.

His ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, a common finding in patients with hypertension.

The chest x-ray is normal, ruling out any underlying lung disease.

Due to the patient's poorly controlled diabetes, he is referred to a diabetes specialist for further management.

He is started on insulin therapy to better control his blood glucose levels before the surgery.

The patient is also advised to follow a strict diabetic diet and engage in regular exercise.

During the surgery, the patient is placed under general anesthesia.

The surgeon successfully repairs the torn meniscus, and the procedure is uneventful.

Postoperatively, the patient is closely monitored for any complications.

Within the first 24 hours after surgery, the patient develops signs of acute renal failure.

His urine output decreases, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels rise significantly.

The patient's vital signs remain stable throughout this time.

A nephrologist is consulted for further evaluation and management of the acute renal failure.

The nephrologist orders a renal ultrasound to assess the kidneys' structure and check for any obstruction.

The ultrasound reveals normal kidney size and no signs of obstruction.

Further blood and urine tests are done to determine the underlying cause of the acute renal failure.

The tests reveal high levels of serum creatinine and proteinuria, indicating a glomerular injury.

The nephrologist diagnoses the patient with acute tubular necrosis, a common cause of acute renal failure post-surgery.

The patient is placed on strict fluid and electrolyte management to optimize renal function.

He also receives medications to manage his blood pressure and protect the kidneys.

Regular monitoring of the patient's renal function, urine output, and electrolyte levels is done to assess his response to treatment.

Over the next few days, the patient's kidney function begins to improve.

His urine output increases, and his BUN and creatinine levels gradually decrease.

The nephrologist continues to closely monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

The patient is advised to continue following a diabetic diet and taking his prescribed medications.

He is also instructed to stay well-hydrated and avoid any nephrotoxic medications.

With proper management, the patient's kidney function fully recovers, and he is discharged from the hospital.

Follow-up appointments are scheduled with both the orthopedic surgeon and the nephrologist to ensure his continued recovery.
