The patient, a 45-year-old male, has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been managing these conditions with medication for the past 10 years. The patient also has a history of smoking for 20 years but has recently quit.

He visited the primary care doctor for a routine check-up and mentioned that he has been experiencing some discomfort in his abdomen, specifically in the area of his gallbladder. After a physical examination and further investigations, it was determined that the patient has gallstones and would need surgery to remove his gallbladder.

The patient is scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in two weeks. He has been advised to stop smoking completely before the surgery to minimize the risk of complications during or after the procedure. He has also been instructed to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the surgery.

During the pre-operative assessment, the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels were found to be well-controlled. His hemoglobin levels were within the normal range. The patient has provided informed consent for the surgery and has been thoroughly explained the risks and benefits of the procedure.

On the day of the surgery, the patient is prepped and taken to the operating room. General anesthesia is administered, and the surgery goes smoothly without any complications. The gallbladder is successfully removed, and the incisions are closed.

However, following the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure as a complication. This is likely due to the combination of pre-existing conditions, including hypertension and diabetes, along with the stress of the surgery itself. The patient's urine output decreases significantly, and there is an increase in serum creatinine levels.

The patient is started on intravenous fluids and closely monitored for any signs of worsening renal function. Additional investigations, including electrolyte levels and urinalysis, are performed to assess the extent of kidney damage. The patient's blood pressure is kept under control with medication.

The patient's renal function gradually improves over the next few days, and his urine output and serum creatinine levels return to normal. He is closely monitored by nephrologists and urologists to ensure complete recovery.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient is provided with appropriate pain management and wound care. He is advised to continue following a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to manage his underlying conditions.

Prior to discharge, the patient receives detailed post-operative instructions regarding wound care, pain medication, and follow-up appointments. He is also educated on the signs and symptoms of complications that he should be on the lookout for.

In follow-up visits, the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels are closely monitored, and adjustments are made to his medication regimen as necessary. Further investigations, including imaging and blood tests, are recommended to ensure complete recovery and to rule out any residual gallstones or biliary complications.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was successful, despite the temporary complication of acute renal failure. With appropriate management, the patient is expected to make a full recovery and resume his normal activities in due time.
