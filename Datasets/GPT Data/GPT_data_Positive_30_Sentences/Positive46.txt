The patient, Mr. X, is a 59-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has been on medication for these conditions, including lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin.

Mr. X has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a heart attack in his 60s. He is a current smoker, with a 30-pack-year history, and is advised to quit smoking before the surgery. He does not consume alcohol regularly.

During the pre-operative evaluation, it was found that Mr. X has well-controlled blood pressure with an average reading of 130/80 mmHg. He has been monitoring his blood glucose levels regularly, and they are within the target range, with a recent HbA1c of 6.8%.

Mr. X underwent a pre-operative ECG, which revealed sinus rhythm with a normal rate and no signs of ischemia or arrhythmias. His lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 180 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol of 110 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 50 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 150 mg/dL.

He has no known drug allergies and has previously tolerated anesthesia for a dental procedure without any complications. His BMI is 28 kg/m2, indicating that he is overweight.

During surgery, Mr. X experienced a complication of acute renal failure. This was characterized by a sudden decrease in his kidney function, with an increase in his serum creatinine level from 1.0 mg/dL to 2.8 mg/dL within 48 hours post-surgery. His urine output decreased significantly, and he developed fluid overload.

To manage the acute renal failure, Mr. X was started on fluid restriction and diuretic therapy to promote urine output. He was also closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, may be considered if his kidney function does not improve.

Possible causes of the acute renal failure after surgery may include intraoperative hypotension, exposure to nephrotoxic medications during the procedure, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or sepsis. Close monitoring and further investigations will be performed to identify the exact cause.

Given his acute renal failure, Mr. X will require a prolonged hospital stay to manage the complications and stabilize his kidney function. Renal consult and nephrology input will be essential in his management. The surgical team will also consider adjusting his medications, such as temporarily discontinuing any potentially nephrotoxic drugs.

Once his kidney function improves, Mr. X will be monitored for any residual renal impairment and the need for any long-term interventions. Strict blood pressure control and optimizing his cardiovascular risk factors will be vital to prevent future complications.

In summary, Mr. X, a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, is scheduled for hernia repair surgery. He experienced a complication of acute renal failure post-surgery, requiring intervention and prolonged hospital stay. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential in managing his condition and preventing further complications.
