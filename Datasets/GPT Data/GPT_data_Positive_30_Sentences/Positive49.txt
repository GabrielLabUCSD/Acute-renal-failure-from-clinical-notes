The patient is a 55-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery for an appendectomy. He has a past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been on antihypertensive medication since then. His blood pressure is generally well-controlled with medication, and he has not experienced any complications related to his hypertension.
Additionally, he has dyslipidemia, and his lipid profile has been managed with statin therapy for the past 5 years. He has regular lipid panel monitoring, and his lipid levels have remained within the target range.
The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago and is on oral hypoglycemic medication. He has been able to maintain his blood glucose levels within the target range with medication and lifestyle modifications. He also receives regular hemoglobin A1c testing to assess his long-term blood sugar control.
In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone cholecystectomy for gallstones and hernia repair. Both procedures were uncomplicated, and the patient recovered well without any postoperative complications or infections.
The patient has no known drug allergies or sensitivities that would impact anesthesia or surgical management. He does not smoke and does not consume alcohol excessively.
Laboratory testing revealed that the patient had normal renal function preoperatively, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 90 mL/min/1.73mÂ². The patient's urinalysis showed no abnormalities, and there was no evidence of proteinuria or hematuria.
Unfortunately, the patient experienced acute renal failure postoperatively. He developed oliguria, with a urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hr for more than 6 hours. His serum creatinine level increased to 2.5 mg/dL, indicating a decline in renal function.
The patient's urine output was monitored closely, and an indwelling urinary catheter was placed to accurately measure urine output. He was also started on intravenous fluid hydration to improve his renal perfusion and diuretics to promote urine production.
The patient was closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances and metabolic acidosis. Serial laboratory tests were performed, including complete blood counts, electrolyte levels, arterial blood gases, and renal function tests.
Renal ultrasound and renal Doppler studies were done to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or signs of renal artery stenosis. These imaging studies, however, did not reveal any significant findings.
Due to the patient's acute renal failure, his surgical recovery was delayed, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and management of his fluid and electrolyte balance. The nephrology team was consulted for further evaluation and management of his renal failure.
The patient was put on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to provide renal support and remove waste products from his blood. Fluid balance was carefully managed to prevent both volume overload and dehydration.
Daily laboratory tests were performed to assess kidney function, including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolyte levels. The daily urine output was also closely monitored to track renal recovery.
The patient's acute renal failure was classified as a postoperative complication, likely caused by a combination of factors such as hypovolemia, decreased renal perfusion during surgery, and the effects of anesthesia.
Efforts were made to avoid further nephrotoxic insults, including the discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic medications and the avoidance of contrast studies or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
The patient's renal function gradually improved over the course of several days. His urine output increased, and his serum creatinine level gradually decreased to 1.5 mg/dL.
The patient was closely followed by the nephrology team, and his renal function continued to improve. He was eventually weaned off CRRT and transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis for ongoing renal support.
A thorough evaluation was conducted to identify any underlying causes or contributing factors to the patient's acute renal failure. However, no specific etiology was identified, and the renal failure was attributed to perioperative factors.
The patient's surgical recovery was eventually complete, and he was discharged home in stable condition. He was advised to continue close follow-up with both his surgical team and nephrology team to monitor his renal function and overall health.+
In conclusion, the patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He previously underwent cholecystectomy and hernia repair without any complications. Unfortunately, the patient experienced acute renal failure postoperatively, which required intensive care and renal replacement therapy. His renal function gradually improved, and he was eventually discharged home in stable condition. Regular follow-up with his surgical and nephrology teams was recommended to monitor his renal function and overall health.
