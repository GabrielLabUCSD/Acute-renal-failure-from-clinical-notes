The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a significant past medical history. He has a history of hypertension, which has been well controlled with medication for the past five years. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient has a BMI of 32, indicating he is overweight. 

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient also has a history of tobacco use, smoking a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. He admits to occasional alcohol consumption, typically two to three drinks per week. The patient does not have any known drug allergies. 

The patient is currently asymptomatic and is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has been experiencing discomfort and pain at the hernia site for the past six months, which has gradually worsened over time. The surgeon has recommended surgical intervention to prevent potential complications. 

The patient has been informed of the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for postoperative complications such as bleeding, infection, and blood clots. He has provided his informed consent for the procedure. 

Preoperatively, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation to ensure his fitness for surgery. He had a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and coagulation studies, all of which were within normal limits. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. 

The anesthesia team evaluated the patient and deemed him to be a moderate surgical risk due to his comorbidities and overweight status. The patient was educated on the importance of stopping smoking and was advised to quit at least four weeks before the surgery to reduce postoperative complications. 

Following the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure as a complication. He presented with decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances. This was likely due to decreased renal perfusion during the surgery, as well as the patient's preexisting conditions, including hypertension and diabetes. 

The patient received appropriate management for acute renal failure, including intravenous fluid resuscitation, diuretics, and close monitoring of his renal function. His fluid and electrolyte status were closely monitored, and the underlying causes of his acute renal failure were addressed. 

The patient's condition gradually improved over the course of several days, and his renal function began to stabilize. He was able to maintain an adequate urine output, and his serum creatinine levels started to decrease. The patient was eventually discharged with a plan for close follow-up with his primary care physician and nephrologist. 

During his hospital stay, the patient received adequate pain control and was encouraged to ambulate to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis. He was also put on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection. 

The patient tolerated the surgery well overall, with no immediate postoperative complications such as bleeding or wound infection. His vital signs remained stable throughout his hospital stay, and he did not require any respiratory support or intensive care level treatment. 

In conclusion, the patient is a 55-year-old male planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and tobacco use. He is currently asymptomatic and well controlled on medications. The patient developed acute renal failure as a postoperative complication, likely due to decreased renal perfusion during surgery. He received appropriate management and his condition improved over time. Close follow-up with his primary care physician and nephrologist was arranged post-discharge.
