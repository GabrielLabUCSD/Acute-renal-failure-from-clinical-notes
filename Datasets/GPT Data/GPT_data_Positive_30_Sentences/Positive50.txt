Patient Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. He is planning to have surgery for an elective procedure. 

In regards to hypertension, the patient has been diagnosed for several years and is currently managed with antihypertensive medications. Blood pressure measurements have generally been within acceptable range, but occasional episodes of elevated blood pressure have been noted. 

Regarding diabetes, the patient was diagnosed 10 years ago and is on a regimen of oral hypoglycemic agents. HbA1c levels have been within target range, indicating good glucose control. No diabetic complications have been reported.

In terms of chronic kidney disease, the patient has been monitored by a nephrologist. Regular renal function tests have shown a stable estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 35 mL/min/1.73mÂ², with occasional fluctuations. No dialysis or renal replacement therapy has been needed at this stage.

Medication history includes lisinopril for hypertension management, metformin for diabetes control, and supplements of calcium and vitamin D for bone health. The patient is compliant with his medication regimen and reports no adverse effects.

It is important to note that the patient has a known allergy to penicillin, which has been documented in his medical records. Alternative antibiotics have been prescribed for previous infections successfully.

Pre-operative assessment reveals no new significant findings. A complete blood count shows mild anemia, likely due to chronic kidney disease. Coagulation profile and liver function tests are within normal limits. Echocardiogram results demonstrate mild left ventricular hypertrophy but no significant valvular abnormalities.

An anesthesiologist evaluation is scheduled prior to surgery to assess the patient's fitness for anesthesia and manage potential intra-operative complications.

Post-surgical complications and outcomes will largely depend on the type of surgery being performed. However, the patient is at an increased risk of cardiovascular events and infection due to his comorbidities. Close monitoring and appropriate prophylactic measures will be implemented.

Furthermore, the patient is at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) following surgery due to his underlying chronic kidney disease. Steps will be taken to preserve renal function and avoid nephrotoxic insults during the perioperative period.

In rare cases, patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing surgery can develop acute renal failure. Early recognition and intervention will be crucial in preventing further damage.

Signs of acute renal failure to monitor for include oliguria, elevated serum creatinine, and electrolyte disturbances. Urinalysis may reveal proteinuria or cellular casts indicative of renal injury.

If acute renal failure  develops, appropriate measures will be taken to optimize renal function. This may include adjusting medication doses, managing fluid and electrolyte balance, and considering consultation with a nephrologist.

In addition to acute renal failure, the patient will be monitored for other post-operative complications such as surgical site infection, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular events. 

The patient will receive regular post-operative follow-up visits to assess wound healing, manage pain, monitor renal function, and adjust medications as needed.

Patient education will focus on the importance of adherence to medication regimens, blood pressure and glucose control, and lifestyle modifications to promote overall health and minimize the risk of further complications.
