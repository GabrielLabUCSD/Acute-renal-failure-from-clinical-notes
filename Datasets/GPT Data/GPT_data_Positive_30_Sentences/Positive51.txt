The patient is a middle-aged individual who is scheduled to undergo surgery in the near future. They have a history of various medical conditions and surgeries. The patient has previously had appendectomy and cholecystectomy surgeries. They also had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery due to coronary artery disease. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, which is being managed with oral medications. They have also been diagnosed with hypertension and are currently taking antihypertensive medications to control their blood pressure.

In addition to these conditions, the patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is taking medication for thyroid hormone replacement therapy. They have also been previously diagnosed with asthma and use an inhaler as needed.

The patient has a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and kidney problems. They report a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in processed foods and sugary drinks.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable with a normal body mass index. However, they have suboptimal glycemic control, with a recent hemoglobin A1c level of 9.2%.

Lab investigations show high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, indicating dyslipidemia. The patient's renal function tests are within normal limits.

Due to the planned surgery, the patient has been advised to stop taking certain medications, such as anticoagulants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in the perioperative period.

After the surgery, the patient experiences acute renal failure, which is a sudden decrease in kidney function. Common risk factors for this complication include advanced age, underlying chronic kidney disease, and exposure to certain medications, such as contrast agents.

The patient develops oliguria, which is a reduced urine output, and experiences fluid overload. They may also show signs of electrolyte imbalances, such as elevated potassium levels.

Treatment of acute renal failure may involve intravenous fluids, diuretics to promote urine output, and close monitoring of electrolyte levels. In some cases, dialysis may be necessary to remove waste products and excess fluids from the body.

To prevent further complications, the patient is monitored closely for signs of infection and sepsis. Adequate hydration and strict control of blood pressure are important factors in managing acute renal failure.

The patient's future management may involve close follow-up with a nephrologist to monitor kidney function and address any underlying causes of the acute renal failure.

Overall, the patient's medical history includes various surgeries and comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and dyslipidemia. They developed acute renal failure post-surgery, which required prompt intervention and management. Moving forward, it is essential for the patient to optimize their lifestyle habits, including diet and exercise, to prevent further complications and ensure better management of their chronic conditions.
