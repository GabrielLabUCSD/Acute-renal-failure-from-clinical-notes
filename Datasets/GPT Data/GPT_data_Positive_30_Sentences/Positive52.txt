The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. He has been on medication for his hypertension and diabetes for the past 10 years. He also takes medication to manage his weight.

The patient had an episode of angina one year ago and had an angioplasty to place a stent in his coronary artery. He has been on antiplatelet therapy since then.

He has a history of sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night. He had a sleep study done last year, which showed moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having had a heart attack at the age of 60. His mother has a history of hypertension and diabetes.

He is a smoker and has been smoking for the past 30 years. He has tried to quit smoking in the past but has been unsuccessful.

The patient has been experiencing knee pain for the past year, which has been progressively worsening. He has been referred to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation and possible surgery.

He had a recent pre-operative evaluation, which showed normal blood work, including a complete blood count, renal function, and liver function tests.

His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmia.

The patient's body mass index (BMI) is 35, indicating obesity. He has been advised to lose weight before the surgery to reduce the risk of complications.

He was also advised to stop smoking at least four weeks before the surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative complications.

Post-surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure. He presented with decreased urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

He was initially managed with intravenous fluids and diuretics to increase urine output and promote renal function.

The patient's renal function gradually improved, and his urine output normalized after three days of treatment.

He was closely monitored for any signs of fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances and received appropriate interventions as needed.

The patient was started on a renal-friendly diet and advised to avoid medications that can further damage the kidneys, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

He was also referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and long-term management of his renal function.

The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue taking his medications as prescribed and follow up with his primary care physician and nephrologist regularly.

He was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a well-balanced diet, to prevent further complications.

The patient was educated about the importance of monitoring his blood pressure and blood sugar levels closely and to report any significant changes or symptoms to his healthcare providers.

He was also educated about the signs and symptoms of angina and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences chest pain or shortness of breath.

The patient was given resources and support to help him quit smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy and counseling.

He was advised to continue using his CPAP machine for his sleep apnea and to follow up with a sleep specialist if he notices any worsening of symptoms.

The patient's surgical procedure was postponed until his renal function improves and stabilizes.
