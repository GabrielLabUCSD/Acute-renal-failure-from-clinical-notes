The patient is a 45-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for an inguinal hernia. He has a medical history of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. His body mass index (BMI) is 35, indicating severe obesity. His diabetes is well-controlled with oral medication, and his blood pressure is managed with antihypertensive medication.

The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night to manage his symptoms. He has been compliant with his CPAP therapy and has not experienced any recent episodes of sleep apnea.

In addition to his chronic medical conditions, the patient has a history of smoking. He has been smoking for 20 years and currently smokes a pack of cigarettes per day. He has expressed interest in quitting smoking and has tried various methods in the past without success.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy done six years ago due to gallstones. The surgery was successful, and there were no complications during the post-operative period. He has not had any other major surgeries in the past.

Upon physical examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with a visible bulge in the inguinal area consistent with an inguinal hernia. There are no signs of infection or inflammation in the area.

Laboratory investigations reveal elevated fasting blood glucose levels, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. His hemoglobin A1c levels are also higher than the target range, indicating long-term poor glycemic control. His renal parameters are within normal limits, suggesting normal kidney function.

The patient has been counseled about the surgical procedure and the potential risks and benefits. He understands the need for a comprehensive pre-operative evaluation to optimize his medical conditions, such as controlling his blood glucose levels and optimizing his blood pressure. He has agreed to follow all pre-operative instructions and attend all necessary appointments.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced complications including acute renal failure. He developed oliguria, with a urine output of less than 400 mL in 24 hours. His laboratory investigations revealed elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, suggestive of impaired kidney function.

The patient was promptly managed with intravenous fluids and diuretics to improve his urine output. His renal function gradually improved over the course of a week, and his urine output returned to normal. He did not require dialysis during this episode of acute renal failure.

A nephrology consult was obtained post-operatively to evaluate the patient's kidney function and to provide further management recommendations. The nephrologist recommended close monitoring of renal function and advised follow-up appointments to ensure proper recovery.

The patient was discharged with appropriate instructions for outpatient management of his surgical site and his chronic medical conditions. He was advised to continue with his diabetic and antihypertensive medications and encouraged to make lifestyle modifications to improve his overall health, including quitting smoking and losing weight.

The patient understands the importance of adhering to these recommendations to reduce the risk of future complications. He has expressed motivation to make positive changes in his lifestyle and has requested information on smoking cessation programs and dietary counseling.

The patient will be followed up at regular intervals to monitor his surgical site healing and to assess his progress in managing his chronic medical conditions. He will also undergo routine laboratory testing to evaluate his kidney function and ensure that his renal parameters remain within normal limits.

In summary, this patient is a 45-year-old male with a complex medical history who is planning to have surgery for an inguinal hernia. He has multiple comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. He has a history of smoking and has expressed interest in quitting. Post-operatively, he developed acute renal failure, which was managed successfully without the need for dialysis. He has been advised on lifestyle modifications and will be closely monitored to prevent future complications.
