The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery.

His past medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.

He has been taking medication for these conditions for the past 10 years.

He had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) 5 years ago and had coronary artery bypass surgery.

He does not smoke but consumes alcohol occasionally.

The patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 65.

He has been experiencing chest pain on exertion for the past few months.

He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed significant coronary artery disease.

His ejection fraction is 40%, indicating reduced heart function.

His primary care physician recommended surgery to improve blood flow to the heart.

The patient is also being treated by a nephrologist for chronic kidney disease.

His renal function is stable with a glomerular filtration rate of 45 ml/min.

His creatinine levels have been consistently high for the past year.

He has no history of surgical complications or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

His pre-operative assessment indicates that he is in good overall health for surgery.

He has been off his antidiabetic medication for the past 24 hours as per the surgeon's instructions.

The patient was admitted to the hospital the day before the surgery.

He was started on bowel preparation to empty his bowels for the surgery.

The patient has been NPO (nothing by mouth) since midnight before the surgery.

His vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented.

He received pre-operative antibiotics as per the hospital protocol.

The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent the planned surgery without any complications.

The surgery lasted for approximately 4 hours, and the patient tolerated it well.

He was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring.

In the PACU, the patient developed acute renal failure as a complication.

His creatinine level increased significantly, and his urine output decreased.

He also started to experience signs of fluid overload, including shortness of breath and increased edema.

He was immediately started on intravenous fluids and diuretics to manage his fluid status.

The patient's nephrologist was consulted, and further investigations were ordered.

He underwent a renal ultrasound, which showed normal-sized kidneys with no evidence of obstruction.

The nephrologist determined that the acute renal failure was likely due to perioperative factors, such as hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.

He received aggressive fluid management, and his renal function gradually improved over the next few days.

The patient was closely monitored during his hospital stay, and his renal function continued to improve.

He was discharged on post-operative day 7 with close follow-up with his nephrologist to monitor his renal function.
