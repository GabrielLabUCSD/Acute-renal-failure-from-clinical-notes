The patient is a 45-year-old male who is preparing to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and high cholesterol. He smokes approximately half a pack of cigarettes per day and consumes alcohol occasionally.

In terms of his hypertension, he has been on amlodipine 10 mg daily for the past five years, which has effectively controlled his blood pressure. As for his diabetes, he takes metformin 1000 mg twice a day in combination with insulin glargine 20 units at bedtime. He routinely monitors his blood glucose levels and maintains them within target range. His lipid profile is managed with atorvastatin 20 mg daily.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy ten years ago and a tonsillectomy in childhood. He has not experienced any complications or adverse reactions to anesthesia in the past. He has never had any issues with bleeding disorders or abnormal clotting.

In terms of allergies, the patient reports being allergic to penicillin, which produces hives and itching upon exposure. He has previously tried sulfa antibiotics without any adverse reactions. The patient has not experienced any episodes of anaphylaxis in the past.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination reveals a well-healed surgical scar from the appendectomy and no signs of infection or other abnormalities.

Lab results indicate that his renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 95 mL/min. His liver function tests, electrolytes, and complete blood count are also within normal range.

During the surgery, the patient experiences complications and develops acute renal failure. His blood pressure drops significantly, and he requires fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to stabilize his hemodynamics. He is transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.

Further investigation reveals that the patient's acute renal failure is likely due to acute tubular necrosis, secondary to intraoperative hypotension and decreased renal perfusion. His urine output decreases significantly, and his serum creatinine rises to 3.5 mg/dL. The renal ultrasound shows bilaterally normal-sized kidneys without any evidence of obstruction.

To address the acute renal failure, the patient undergoes continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to support his kidney function while optimizing hemodynamic stability. Fluid balance is carefully monitored, and diuretics are administered to help promote urine production and clearance of waste products.

During his recovery, the patient's renal function gradually improves, and his urine output starts to increase. His serum creatinine levels stabilize, and he is weaned off CRRT. Renal imaging is repeated and shows resolution of the acute tubular necrosis.

The patient's overall post-operative course is complicated by the development of a surgical site infection, which requires a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics and wound care. Additionally, he experiences difficulty managing his blood glucose levels, requiring temporary adjustment of his diabetes medications.

Despite these setbacks, the patient eventually recovers, and his renal function returns to normal. He is discharged home with close follow-up appointments to monitor his kidney function, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. He is advised to quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption to further improve his overall health. The patient is educated on the importance of regular exercise and a healthy diet, along with strict adherence to his medication regimen.
