The patient is a 55-year-old female who is planning to have surgery. She has a medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient’s hypertension has been well controlled on an angiotensin receptor blocker and diuretic combination, with a blood pressure consistently around 130/80 mmHg. Her diabetes is managed with an oral anti-diabetic medication, and her glycated hemoglobin values have been consistently below 7%.

Her hyperlipidemia is being treated with a statin, and her lipid panel consistently shows low LDL cholesterol levels. She has no history of cardiovascular disease. 

The patient has a known allergy to penicillin, and any preoperative antibiotics will need to be chosen accordingly. 

In terms of surgical history, the patient has previously undergone a cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. The surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient recovered well. 

She is a non-smoker and denies any history of substance abuse. 

An assessment of her current medications indicates no contraindications to anesthesia or surgery. 

The patient’s physical examination is within normal limits, with no significant findings. Her body mass index is within the normal range, and she has no signs of malnutrition. 

Laboratory investigations show normal liver and kidney function, with no evidence of renal impairment. Her complete blood count is within normal limits, and her coagulation profile shows no evidence of abnormal bleeding tendencies. 

The patient’s chest x-ray is clear, with no signs of any active pulmonary disease. 

An electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias. 

The patient has been educated about the surgery and potential complications, including infection, bleeding, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. She has consented to the procedure and understands the risks involved. 

Before the surgery, the patient will need to undergo routine preoperative assessments, including a comprehensive history and physical examination. 

She will also need to complete necessary preoperative blood work, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and renal and liver function tests. 

A baseline electrocardiogram and chest x-ray will also be performed. 

The patient will be asked to adhere to fasting guidelines prior to the surgery and to discontinue any medications that may interfere with the surgery or anesthesia. 

During the surgery, the patient will be monitored closely, with continuous blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation monitoring. 

A central venous line may be inserted to monitor fluid status and to administer medications and fluids as needed. 

The patient will be given perioperative antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. 

Immediate postoperative care will focus on pain management, maintaining hemodynamic stability, and ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition. 

The patient will be encouraged to ambulate early and to cough and deep breathe to prevent any postoperative complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis. 

The patient will be closely monitored for any signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to medication or anesthesia. 

Anesthesia-related complications such as aspiration pneumonia or respiratory depression will be vigilantly watched for. 

Absolute bed rest will be initiated with the patient strictly monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit. 

The patient's complete blood count, coagulation profile, and renal and liver function tests will be monitored daily for any signs of abnormalities or complications. 

The patient is stable post-op and recovering well. However, on the third postoperative day, the patient develops acute renal failure, with a sudden decline in urine output and a significant increase in serum creatinine levels. 

This complication is likely due to acute tubular necrosis caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury during surgery. 

The patient's fluid status will be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions such as diuretics or renal replacement therapy may be initiated if necessary. 

The patient's medications will be reviewed, with any nephrotoxic agents held or adjusted as needed to preserve renal function. 

Close follow-up and serial laboratory monitoring will be arranged to assess the patient's renal recovery and ensure appropriate management of the acute renal failure.
