The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair.
He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.
Mr. Smith has been on medication for his hypertension for the past 10 years and his blood pressure has been well controlled.
He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and has been managing it with oral medication and lifestyle modifications.
His diabetes has been well controlled with a hemoglobin A1c level ranging from 6.5% to 7.0%.
Mr. Smith also has a history of high cholesterol levels and has been on statin medication to manage it.
He has been compliant with his medication regimen and his lipid profile has improved over the years.
In addition to his medical history, he has a family history of heart disease and stroke.
Mr. Smith does not smoke and rarely drinks alcohol.
He leads a sedentary lifestyle and does not engage in regular exercise.
His surgical history includes a cholecystectomy performed five years ago due to gallstone disease.
Prior to the surgery, Mr. Smith will need to undergo pre-operative testing including bloodwork, EKG, and chest X-ray.
His baseline kidney function will be assessed through serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels.
Following the surgery, Mr. Smith experienced post-operative complications, including acute renal failure.
Acute renal failure is a sudden impairment of kidney function, resulting in a buildup of waste products in the body.
This can occur as a result of many factors, including decreased blood flow to the kidneys during surgery.
The symptoms of acute renal failure may include decreased urine output, swelling in the legs and ankles, fatigue, and confusion.
In Mr. Smith's case, his kidney function deteriorated rapidly after surgery, resulting in the need for dialysis.
Treatment for his acute renal failure included hemodialysis, which helps remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood.
The underlying cause of his acute renal failure was believed to be related to the surgery itself, as there were no pre-existing kidney conditions.
Mr. Smith was closely monitored by a nephrologist during his hospital stay to manage his kidney function.
He received intravenous fluids and medications to support his kidneys and prevent further damage.
After several sessions of hemodialysis, Mr. Smith's kidney function began to improve, and he was able to be weaned off dialysis.
He was discharged from the hospital with close follow-up appointments to monitor his kidney function.
It is important for Mr. Smith to adhere to his medication regimen and make lifestyle modifications to prevent any further kidney complications.
He should also maintain regular follow-up visits with his primary care physician, nephrologist, and surgeon to monitor his overall health and progress.
