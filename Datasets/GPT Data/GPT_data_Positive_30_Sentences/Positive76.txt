The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia. 

His hypertension has been well-controlled with medication for the past five years. He takes a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. His blood pressure readings have consistently been in the range of 120/80 mmHg during routine visits. 

Mr. Smith also has diabetes mellitus type 2, which was diagnosed 10 years ago. He manages his diabetes through diet, exercise, and medication. He takes metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor to control his blood sugar levels, which have been within the target range of 80-130 mg/dL for fasting glucose and less than 180 mg/dL for postprandial glucose.

In addition, Mr. Smith has dyslipidemia, with an elevated total cholesterol level of 260 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of 180 mg/dL. He takes a statin drug to manage his cholesterol levels and has achieved a significant reduction in his lipid profile, with current levels at 180 mg/dL for total cholesterol and 100 mg/dL for LDL cholesterol.

Mr. Smith does not smoke and consumes alcohol in moderation. He leads a sedentary lifestyle but follows a healthy diet. 

His surgical procedure will involve general anesthesia and is scheduled to take place in two weeks' time. The anticipated duration of the surgery is two hours. 

After surgery, Mr. Smith experienced acute renal failure as a complication. He presented with oliguria, increased serum creatinine levels, and decreased urine output. 

In the postoperative period, Mr. Smith was monitored closely and received appropriate management for his renal failure. He was placed on fluid restriction and given diuretic therapy to promote diuresis and improve renal function. Electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, were corrected. 

His renal function gradually improved, with an increase in urine output and normalization of serum creatinine levels over the course of three days. 

Mr. Smith did not require renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy. 

He did not experience any other major complications following surgery, such as wound infection or respiratory issues. 

During his hospital stay, Mr. Smith received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections. 

Pain management was achieved through a multimodal approach, including non-opioid analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia with opioids.

Mr. Smith was able to ambulate independently on postoperative day one and was encouraged to perform respiratory exercises to prevent complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia.

He was discharged on postoperative day four with appropriate instructions for wound care and follow-up appointments. Mr. Smith was advised to continue his regular medications and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

A comprehensive plan for perioperative management was devised in collaboration with other members of the healthcare team, including an anesthesiologist, surgeon, and nursing staff.

Given Mr. Smith's medical history, close attention was paid to monitoring his blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid profile during the perioperative period.

Throughout the surgical process, communication with Mr. Smith and his family was clear and transparent, ensuring that they were well-informed about the potential risks and benefits of the procedure.

Efforts were made to minimize Mr. Smith's exposure to potential complications, such as infection, by adhering to strict aseptic techniques and ensuring proper wound care.

In summary, Mr. Smith, a 65-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia, is planning to undergo surgery. He developed acute renal failure as a complication after surgery but responded well to conservative management. The perioperative period was carefully managed to optimize his overall outcomes, with multidisciplinary collaboration and patient education playing crucial roles in his care.
