The patient, a 55-year-old male, has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia.
He has been managing these conditions with medications, including metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.
He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.
Furthermore, the patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases, with his father having had a myocardial infarction at a young age.
During the pre-operative evaluation, it was discovered that the patient had an elevated blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg.
His blood glucose levels were well-controlled, with a fasting blood sugar of 120 mg/dL.
Additionally, his lipid profile was within normal limits, with a total cholesterol of 180 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL.
The patient reported no known drug allergies.
His physical examination revealed no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems.
Furthermore, his laboratory results showed normal kidney and liver function tests.
An ECG was performed, which showed no signs of ischemia or arrhythmias.
The patient's surgical procedure involves the removal of a benign mass from his left lung.
He has had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, which confirmed the presence of the mass and its benign nature.
The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia.
During the surgery, the patient will have invasive monitoring, with an arterial line for blood pressure monitoring and a central venous line for fluid administration.
The anesthesia team will also place a urinary catheter for accurate measurement of urine output during and after the surgery.
Following the surgery, the patient will be closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for any signs of complications, such as bleeding, infection, or respiratory distress.
He will be given appropriate pain medications to manage post-operative pain.
The patient will also be started on deep breathing and coughing exercises to prevent respiratory complications.
During the first post-operative day, the patient developed acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine and decreased urine output.
His blood pressure remained elevated at 170/100 mmHg.
The nephrology team was consulted and started the patient on intravenous fluids and a diuretic to improve urine output and manage his blood pressure.
Further investigations, including renal ultrasound and urine analysis, were performed to determine the cause of the acute renal failure.
The ultrasound showed no signs of obstruction or structural abnormalities in the kidneys.
The urine analysis revealed no red or white blood cells, ruling out any inflammatory or infectious causes of the renal failure.
Given the patient's previous medical history of hypertension and diabetes, the nephrologist concluded that the acute renal failure was likely caused by perioperative renal ischemia.
The patient's acute renal failure was managed conservatively, with strict volume control, blood pressure management, and monitoring of renal function.
Over the next several days, the patient's renal function gradually improved, with a return to baseline creatinine levels and increased urine output.
He was able to discontinue dialysis and was discharged from the hospital with instructions for close follow-up with the nephrology team.
Overall, the patient's surgery had a successful outcome, with the removal of the benign mass. However, his experience of acute renal failure served as a reminder of the importance of careful perioperative management to prevent complications in high-risk patients.
