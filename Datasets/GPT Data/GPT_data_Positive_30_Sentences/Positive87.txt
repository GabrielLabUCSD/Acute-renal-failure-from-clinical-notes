The patient, a 55-year-old male, has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been on multiple medications to manage his conditions, including antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, and bronchodilators. 

He has a long-standing history of smoking, with a 30 pack-year smoking history. Despite attempts to quit, he continues to smoke, which puts him at increased risk for surgical complications. 

The patient has had several previous surgeries, including a cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease and a knee arthroscopy for a meniscal tear. He did well with both procedures and had an uneventful recovery.

His current surgical plan is for an elective inguinal hernia repair. The decision for surgery was made after the patient experienced significant discomfort and occasional pain with physical activity. The hernia is reducible, and the patient desires surgical correction to improve his quality of life.

Preoperative labs indicate that the patient's blood glucose levels are within target range, with a HbA1c of 6.9%. His blood pressure is well controlled, with a current reading of 128/78 mmHg. However, his baseline pulmonary function tests show mild airflow limitation with an FEV1/FVC ratio of 65%.

The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. However, due to his medical history, he is at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) following surgery.

During the surgery, the patient is positioned supine with general anesthesia administered. The surgical team takes extra precautions to ensure patient safety, including adequate fluid balance, careful monitoring of blood pressure, and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications.

Despite these measures, the patient develops postoperative acute renal failure. His urine output decreases significantly, and his serum creatinine level rises to 2.5 mg/dL within 48 hours of surgery. He also experiences electrolyte imbalances, with a potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L and metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.32.

The patient is immediately started on IV fluids and diuretics to promote urine output and improve kidney function. He is also monitored closely for signs of fluid overload and electrolyte abnormalities.

The underlying cause of the acute renal failure is determined to be acute tubular necrosis, likely due to a combination of pre-existing renal impairment, intraoperative hypotension, and possible exposure to nephrotoxic medications.

The patient's renal function gradually improves over the next few days with appropriate management of his fluid status, electrolyte balance, and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents. His urine output increases, and his serum creatinine level declines to 1.2 mg/dL.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient receives hemodialysis to support his renal function until adequate recovery is achieved. He is also closely monitored for any signs of infection or other complications related to his acute renal failure.

The patient's postoperative course is complicated by the development of a surgical site infection. He presents with increasing erythema, warmth, and purulent discharge at the incision site. Cultures are taken, and appropriate antibiotics are initiated.

The surgical site infection is successfully treated with a combination of wound care, antibiotic therapy, and close follow-up. The infection resolves, and the patient's incision heals without further complications.

Despite the postoperative complications, the patient eventually recovers well and is discharged home with appropriate postoperative instructions. He is advised to quit smoking, continue his medications as prescribed, and monitor his blood glucose levels closely.

The patient is scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to monitor his renal function and overall health. He is counseled on the importance of adhering to a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation.

In conclusion, this patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and COPD, which increase his surgical risk. Despite careful intraoperative management, he develops acute renal failure postoperatively, likely due to a combination of factors. With appropriate treatment and management, his renal function gradually improves, and he recovers well. Close follow-up and ongoing monitoring of his renal function will be necessary to ensure his long-term health and well-being.
