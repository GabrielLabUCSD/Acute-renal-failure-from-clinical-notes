The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to have surgery to address a chronic knee injury. He has been experiencing ongoing pain and limited mobility in his knee for the past two years. He has tried physical therapy and various pain medications, but none have provided significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and has been on medication to manage his blood pressure for the past 10 years. In addition, he has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having suffered a heart attack at age 60.

The patient's medical history also includes a previous surgery to repair a hernia 5 years ago, which was successful without any complications. However, during that surgery, the patient had some difficulties with anesthesia, experiencing nausea and vomiting in the recovery room. Since then, he has been alerting healthcare providers of his sensitivity to certain medications.

On examination, the patient has normal vital signs, including a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. His knee exhibits moderate swelling, limited range of motion, and tenderness upon palpation. Laboratory tests reveal a slight elevation in his fasting blood glucose levels, indicating borderline diabetes. The patient's renal function is normal, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 90 mL/min/1.73 m².

In preparation for surgery, the patient undergoes a thorough preoperative evaluation. An electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm and no signs of cardiac abnormalities. Chest X-ray reveals clear lung fields, ruling out any pulmonary issues. The patient also meets with an anesthesiologist to discuss his concerns related to previous anesthesia complications.

Surgeons plan to perform a total knee replacement to address the patient's chronic knee pain and limited mobility. The procedure involves removing damaged portions of bone and cartilage and replacing them with metal and plastic components, restoring joint function and reducing pain. The risks and benefits of the procedure are thoroughly explained to the patient, who understands the potential complications, including infection, blood clots, and adverse reactions to anesthesia.

During surgery, the patient experiences a longer than anticipated duration under anesthesia due to technical difficulties encountered by the surgical team. The procedure is completed successfully, and the patient is transferred to the recovery room. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is monitored closely for signs of pain, bleeding, infection, and decreased oxygen saturation.

On day two post-surgery, the patient starts experiencing decreased urine output, mild shortness of breath, and a rise in serum creatinine levels to 2.1 mg/dL. These clinical findings are suggestive of acute renal failure, possibly caused by a decrease in renal blood flow or complications associated with the surgery. The patient is immediately started on intravenous fluids to ensure adequate hydration and to potentially improve renal perfusion.

Repeat laboratory tests confirm a progressive decline in renal function, with a rise in serum creatinine to 3.4 mg/dL and a decrease in eGFR to 30 mL/min/1.73m². The patient's urine output remains minimal despite the fluid resuscitation efforts. A nephrology consult is requested to further evaluate the cause of the acute renal failure and guide management.

Several potential etiologies are considered, including hypovolemia, intraoperative hypotension, use of nephrotoxic medications, and postoperative sepsis. An ultrasound of the kidneys is performed, which shows no structural abnormalities or signs of obstructive uropathy. The patient is screened for urinary tract infection, which comes back negative.

The nephrologist starts the patient on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to provide long-term renal support. This therapy helps remove waste products and excess fluid from the body, maintaining the patient's electrolyte balance and acid-base equilibrium.

The patient's condition gradually improves over the next few days with CRRT and supportive care. His urine output increases, and his serum creatinine begins to decline. After a week of CRRT, his kidney function stabilizes, with a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73m². The nephrologist feels confident that the patient's renal function will continue to recover and advises monitoring his kidney function closely in the follow-up period.

The patient is eventually discharged from the hospital with a planned outpatient follow-up with both the nephrologist and the orthopedic surgeon. He receives prescriptions for pain management and physical therapy to aid in the recovery of his knee replacement. The patient is advised to maintain a close eye on his blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and renal function in the future. Additionally, he is counseled on the importance of hydration and the need to promptly report any signs of infection or worsening renal function.
