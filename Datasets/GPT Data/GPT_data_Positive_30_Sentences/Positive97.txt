The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He has been on medication for his conditions for the past ten years. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 32, which classifies him as obese. He has a sedentary lifestyle and does not engage in any regular physical activity. The patient is a former smoker, but he quit smoking ten years ago.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has had an appendectomy and a cholecystectomy in the past. Both surgeries were performed without any complications. The patient has no known allergies to medications, latex, or any other substances. However, he does have a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having a heart attack at the age of 55.

The patient's current medications include metformin for diabetes management, lisinopril for hypertension, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He takes these medications regularly and has been compliant with his treatment regimen. The patient's blood pressure is well controlled, with his last recorded reading being 120/80 mmHg.

The patient is scheduled to undergo an elective surgery for prostate gland removal due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The surgery is planned to be performed under general anesthesia, and the patient has been informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure. Preoperative tests, including blood work and electrocardiogram, have been conducted, and the patient's overall health is deemed suitable for surgery.

During the surgical procedure, the patient experiences a sudden drop in blood pressure and presents signs of acute renal failure. He develops oliguria, with a urine output of less than 400 mL per day. The patient's serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are elevated, indicating decreased kidney function. Renal ultrasound reveals no structural abnormalities, suggesting that the acute renal failure is likely due to ischemic or toxic injury.

The patient is immediately transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and management of his renal failure. He is started on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances. The patient's medications are adjusted to avoid any potential nephrotoxic effects. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, is considered if the patient's kidney function does not improve.

Close monitoring of the patient's fluid intake and output, as well as daily laboratory tests, is initiated. The patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, are continuously monitored. The surgical team collaborates with a nephrologist to closely manage the patient's renal function and prevent further complications.

The patient's urine output gradually improves over the next few days, and his serum creatinine levels begin to decline. Additional investigations, such as renal biopsies or imaging studies, may be considered if there are no signs of improvement or if the underlying cause of the acute renal failure remains unclear.

Overall, the patient's medical history, including his comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia, provided important information for the surgical team to assess his perioperative risk. However, the acute renal failure after surgery presents an unexpected complication that requires immediate intervention and ongoing management to ensure optimal recovery.
