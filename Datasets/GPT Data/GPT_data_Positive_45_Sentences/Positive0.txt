Postoperative complications can occur in any surgery, and one potential complication is acute renal failure. This condition occurs when the kidneys suddenly lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. In the case of this patient, acute renal failure develops after the surgery. It can occur due to various factors, such as decreased blood flow to the kidneys during surgery, the use of certain medications, or the development of systemic infections.

The patient may present with symptoms such as decreased urine output, fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated blood pressure. They may experience fatigue, confusion, and swelling in the hands, feet, or face.

To manage acute renal failure, the patient would likely require supportive care, including close monitoring of their fluid and electrolyte balance. Diuretics may be used to increase urine output and remove excess fluid. Medications to control blood pressure may also be necessary. Depending on the severity of renal failure, the patient might require renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy.

Overall, this patient is in good health and has no significant preexisting medical conditions. However, in the event of acute renal failure after surgery, close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to ensure optimal outcomes.
