The patient is a 65-year-old female who has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. She has been taking medications for both conditions for the past 10 years. Additionally, she has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with her father having had a heart attack in his 50s.

The patient has a long-standing history of smoking, having smoked a pack a day for the past 40 years. She has tried to quit smoking multiple times but has been unsuccessful. She does not consume alcohol or use recreational drugs.

Her current medications include metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. She takes these medications regularly and has good adherence to her treatment regimen.

The patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of knee osteoarthritis in recent years, which have significantly impacted her quality of life. She has difficulty walking and experiences pain and stiffness in her knees. Conservative management with physical therapy and analgesics has provided minimal relief.

As a result, the patient and her healthcare team have decided to proceed with total knee replacement surgery. She has undergone all necessary preoperative evaluations, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and electrocardiogram. Additionally, she has had a thorough assessment of her kidney function, which showed stable renal function.

The patient is scheduled to undergo surgery in one week. She has been provided with preoperative instructions, including the need for fasting and the discontinuation of certain medications. She has been advised to continue taking her antihypertensive medication on the morning of surgery with a sip of water.

The patient is also informed about the potential complications associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and blood clots. She has been counseled about the importance of postoperative physical therapy and pain management to aid in her recovery.

On the day of surgery, the patient arrives at the hospital and is prepared for the procedure. She is placed under general anesthesia, and the surgery proceeds as planned. The total knee replacement is successful, with no immediate complications noted during the procedure.

Following surgery, the patient is closely monitored in the recovery room. Her vital signs are stable, and she is awake and alert. She is given intravenous pain medication to control her postoperative discomfort.

However, on the first postoperative day, the patient develops acute renal failure. Her urine output decreases significantly, and her serum creatinine levels rise rapidly. The cause of her renal failure is likely multifactorial, with possible contributions from intraoperative hypotension, complications of anesthesia, and medication administration.

The patient's renal function is closely monitored, and she is started on aggressive fluid resuscitation and diuresis under the guidance of a nephrologist. Her medications are adjusted to minimize further harm to her kidneys.

Over the next few days, the patient's renal function begins to improve. Her urine output increases, and her serum creatinine levels start to gradually decline. The nephrology team continues to closely monitor her renal function and provide additional treatments as needed.

Overall, the patient's recovery from the total knee replacement surgery is delayed due to the development of acute renal failure. She requires a longer hospital stay for close monitoring and ongoing management of her kidney function.

During her hospitalization, the patient receives physical therapy to aid in her knee rehabilitation. She is mobilized with the help of a walker and gradually progresses to using crutches. Pain management is achieved through a combination of systemic analgesics and local anesthetic techniques.

After a week in the hospital, the patient's renal function stabilizes, and she is discharged home. She is provided with instructions for postoperative care, including wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments.

In the following weeks, the patient continues her recovery at home. She diligently attends physical therapy sessions and faithfully takes her prescribed medications. Her renal function gradually improves, and she no longer requires close monitoring by a nephrologist.

At her six-week follow-up appointment, the patient's knee rehabilitation progress is satisfactory. Her range of motion has significantly improved, and she is able to walk short distances without assistance. Her renal function has completely returned to baseline, and she is advised to continue her current medications.

The patient is extremely satisfied with the outcome of her total knee replacement surgery. She reports a significant reduction in knee pain and improved mobility. She acknowledges that her road to recovery was challenging due to the acute renal failure complication but is grateful for the support and care provided by her healthcare team.
