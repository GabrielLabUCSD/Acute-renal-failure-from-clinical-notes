The patient in question is scheduled to undergo surgery and has a comprehensive medical history. The patient, a 62-year-old male, has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 controlled with oral medications. Additionally, the patient has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 15 years ago. The patient also has a family history of coronary artery disease, with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.

A review of systems reveals no significant abnormalities, with the patient denying any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient reports occasional exertional dyspnea, but it does not limit his activities. Furthermore, the patient denies any gastrointestinal symptoms such as reflux, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. There are no neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or changes in sensation.

Recent laboratory results show a complete blood count within normal limits, with a hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 82 mL/min/1.73mÂ². Liver function tests and electrolytes are also within normal limits. The patient's lipid panel reveals a total cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 130 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 150 mg/dL.

Cardiovascular risk factors are addressed by the patient being prescribed aspirin 81 mg daily, a statin for hyperlipidemia, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for hypertension. The patient is adherent to his medications and regularly follows up with his primary care physician.

Given the patient's medical history and risk factors, the surgical team has requested an additional preoperative evaluation. As part of this evaluation, a stress test was performed to assess the patient's cardiovascular fitness. The stress test showed no significant abnormalities, with the patient achieving 10 metabolic equivalents (METS) and no evidence of ischemia. Additionally, an echocardiogram was performed and revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60%.

The patient was also evaluated by a pulmonary specialist, who found no evidence of lung disease or impaired lung function. The patient has a normal chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests. The anesthesiology team reviewed the patient's medical history and confirmed him to be at low risk for perioperative complications.

Following surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure, evidenced by an increase in serum creatinine to 2.5 mg/dL and a decrease in urine output below 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours. The patient's electrolytes became deranged, with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis developing. The patient required initiation of renal replacement therapy in the form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for management of his acute renal failure.

The patient's surgical incision is healing well without signs of infection or dehiscence. The patient's pain is well controlled with intravenous opioid analgesics, and there are no signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The patient continues to be closely monitored in the intensive care unit by a multidisciplinary team, including nephrologists, surgeons, and intensivists. Frequent laboratory testing, including arterial blood gases, renal function panel, and electrolyte levels, is being conducted to guide the patient's management. The goal is to optimize the patient's fluid status, correct his electrolyte imbalances, and achieve renal recovery to allow for discontinuation of CRRT.

The patient's family has been updated on his condition and is fully aware of the treatment plan and possible complications. They have expressed their understanding and support. The patient remains in stable condition but requires ongoing care and monitoring to manage his acute renal failure.

Overall, the patient's medical history and risk factors have been thoroughly evaluated before surgery. Although the development of acute renal failure complicates his post-operative course, the patient is receiving appropriate management and his overall prognosis is guarded. The multidisciplinary team is working collaboratively to ensure the patient's optimal recovery.
