The patient, a 55-year-old male, is planning to undergo surgery for an elective procedure. He has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years, which is currently well managed on medication. His blood pressure ranges from 120/80 to 130/90 mmHg. The patient does not smoke and has never consumed alcohol excessively.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had appendectomy surgery 15 years ago following acute appendicitis. He had no complications during or after the surgery and made a full recovery. The surgical incision healed well with no signs of infection or hernia.

The patient's medical history also includes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed 7 years ago. He manages this condition with dietary modifications and oral hypoglycemic medication. His fasting blood glucose levels range from 90-110 mg/dL, indicating good glycemic control.

In addition to hypertension and diabetes, the patient has a past history of hyperlipidemia, diagnosed 5 years ago. He takes a statin medication to control his cholesterol levels. Recent lipid profile results show a total cholesterol level of 180 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg/dL, indicating well-controlled hyperlipidemia.

The patient has a history of allergic rhinitis, which is exacerbated by environmental allergens such as pollen or dust mites. He takes over-the-counter antihistamines as needed for symptom relief.

Regarding family history, the patient's father had a history of coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. However, the patient has never experienced any cardiovascular symptoms or episodes of chest pain.

The patient has had an annual physical examination, including routine laboratory tests, which have all been within normal limits. He has also undergone echocardiography, which showed normal cardiac function and no evidence of structural abnormalities.

Recent electrocardiography revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia. The patient has never experienced any cardiac events, such as a myocardial infarction or heart failure.

The patient has never undergone general anesthesia but has experienced local anesthesia for dental procedures without any complications. He reports no history of adverse reactions to any medications or anesthesia agents.

As part of the preoperative assessment, the patient underwent a comprehensive pulmonary function test, which demonstrated normal lung function. He does not have a history of chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a resting heart rate of 70 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. His body mass index (BMI) is within the normal range at 24 kg/mÂ², indicating a healthy weight.

Laboratory investigations revealed a normal complete blood count with no signs of anemia or other abnormalities. Renal function tests, including serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, were within normal limits, indicating healthy kidney function.

The patient had a baseline coagulation profile, which showed normal values for prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). He has never had a history of bleeding disorders or excessive bleeding after minor procedures.

The patient's surgical team will include an anesthesiologist who will monitor the patient's vital signs, administer anesthesia, and manage postoperative pain control. The surgeon will perform the procedure and monitor the patient's progress during the postoperative period.

During the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, a rare complication. His urine output decreased significantly, and his serum creatinine levels rose rapidly. An ultrasound examination revealed no structural abnormalities in the kidneys.  The patient was diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis, which is often caused by prolonged hypoperfusion of the kidneys during surgery.

To manage the acute renal failure, the patient will be closely monitored, and supportive measures such as intravenous hydration will be initiated. The medical team will also closely monitor electrolyte and fluid balance and adjust interventions accordingly. The patient's vital signs and urine output will be regularly assessed to ensure adequate renal function recovery.

As part of the postoperative care plan, the patient will be placed on a low-sodium diet to assist in managing fluid balance. The surgical incision will be assessed for signs of infection, and appropriate wound care will be provided.

The medical team will closely monitor the patient for any signs of sepsis or other postoperative complications, as patients with acute renal failure are at an increased risk of infection. Interventions such as antibiotic therapy may be initiated if necessary.

To prevent the development of further complications, the patient will be encouraged to adhere to medication regimes for his pre-existing medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The surgical team will also closely monitor his glucose levels to ensure they remain within normal limits during the recovery period.

The patient will be educated on the signs and symptoms of potential complications, such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He will also be instructed on appropriate postoperative exercises and encouraged to mobilize as soon as possible to prevent any complications related to immobility.

The patient's surgical team will provide ongoing care and follow-up visits to ensure his recovery is progressing as expected. Further investigations, such as renal imaging or consultation with a nephrologist, may be necessary depending on the patient's response to treatment and resolution of acute renal failure.

Overall, the patient has a relatively stable medical history, with well-controlled hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The development of acute renal failure post-surgery is a rare and unfortunate complication, which will require close monitoring and management to ensure a successful recovery.
