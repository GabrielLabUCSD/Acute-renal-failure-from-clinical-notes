This is a patient summary of a 65-year-old male who is currently planning to have surgery. The patient has a medical history that includes asthma, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a previous myocardial infarction. He is currently taking medications for asthma and hypertension, including an albuterol inhaler and lisinopril. Additionally, the patient has a family history of heart disease, with his father passing away from a heart attack at the age of 60.

The patient's asthma has been well controlled with regular use of his inhaler, and he has not had any recent exacerbations or hospitalizations related to asthma. However, he has experienced occasional shortness of breath with exertion, which he attributes to his asthma.

In regard to his hypertension, the patient has been on lisinopril for the past 5 years and consistently reports good blood pressure control. He monitors his blood pressure at home and regularly visits his primary care physician for check-ups. He has not experienced any recent hypertensive crises or complications related to his hypertension.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), which was diagnosed following a myocardial infarction (MI) 10 years ago. He underwent cardiac catheterization at that time, which revealed significant coronary artery stenosis. As a result, the patient had a stent placed in one of his coronary arteries and was started on aspirin and a statin medication for long-term management of his CAD. Since then, he has been asymptomatic for angina and has not required any further cardiac interventions.

As part of the patient's preoperative evaluation, routine bloodwork was performed that showed normal kidney function. However, following the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was likely due to the surgical procedure. He experienced a decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function.

To manage the acute renal failure, the patient received intravenous fluids and was closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances. His urine output gradually improved, and his serum creatinine levels began to decrease. The patient was started on renal protective medications, including a low-dose dopamine drip and a loop diuretic, to help optimize kidney function and prevent further damage.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's kidney function continued to improve, and he was eventually able to be discharged with stable renal function. However, he was advised to closely monitor his kidney function post-discharge and follow up with a nephrologist for further evaluation.

In summary, this 65-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, CAD, and a previous MI is planning to undergo surgery. His asthma has been well controlled, and he has not experienced any recent exacerbations. His hypertension has been well-managed with lisinopril, and he has not had any recent hypertensive crises. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received a stent 10 years ago to treat his CAD, and he has been asymptomatic since then. However, he developed acute renal failure following the surgery, which was managed with intravenous fluids and renal protective medications. The patient's renal function gradually improved, and he was discharged with stable kidney function, although he was advised to closely monitor his kidney function post-discharge.
