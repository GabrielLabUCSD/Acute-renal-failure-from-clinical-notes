The patient is a 55-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for an inguinal hernia repair. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient's hypertension has been well-controlled with a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and losartan. He has never experienced any complications related to his hypertension, such as end-organ damage or stroke.

For his hyperlipidemia, the patient takes atorvastatin, which has successfully lowered his cholesterol levels to within the recommended range. He has not experienced any cardiovascular events related to his hyperlipidemia.

His type 2 diabetes mellitus is managed with metformin, and he follows a strict diabetic diet. His blood glucose levels have been stable, and he has not experienced any episodes of hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.

The patient has no known drug allergies and is a non-smoker. He consumes alcohol occasionally and denies any recreational drug use.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable. His blood pressure is 130/82 mmHg, pulse rate is 76 bpm, respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He is of average weight and height, with a body mass index (BMI) of 26.5 kg/m2.

Laboratory investigations show normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and thyroid function tests. His fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL, and HbA1c is 6.5%, indicating good glycemic control.

A preoperative electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes or conduction abnormalities. An echocardiogram shows preserved left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy performed in childhood and a cholecystectomy performed 10 years ago for symptomatic gallstones. Both surgeries were uneventful, with no postoperative complications.

During the preoperative evaluation, the anesthesiologist determines the patient to be at low risk for surgery-related complications based on his medical history and physical examination. The patient is scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia.

Postoperatively, the patient develops acute renal failure, which is a known complication of surgery. He presents with decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine levels, and fluid overload.

The cause of his acute renal failure is determined to be acute tubular necrosis due to hypoperfusion during surgery. The patient is managed with fluid resuscitation, diuretics, and close monitoring of his fluid and electrolyte status.

The patient's renal function gradually improves over the course of several days, with a concurrent increase in urine output and a decline in serum creatinine levels. He is discharged from the hospital with instructions to follow up with a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of his renal function.

Before scheduling any future surgeries, the patient will need a thorough evaluation of his renal function to determine if he is at increased risk for developing acute renal failure again. The risks and benefits of any future surgical procedures will need to be carefully weighed, taking into account the potential impact on the patient's renal function.
