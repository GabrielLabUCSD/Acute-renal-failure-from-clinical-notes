The patient is a 65-year-old male who is scheduled for surgery to repair a hernia. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He has been taking medications to control his blood pressure and cholesterol levels for the past 10 years. He does not have any known drug allergies.

The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. He exercises regularly by taking walks in the park and follows a healthy diet. He denies any significant family history of cardiovascular diseases or cancer.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6°F (37°C). His body mass index is within the normal range at 25 kg/m². He appears well-nourished and in no acute distress.

Laboratory investigations including a complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. However, his preoperative electrocardiogram showed evidence of mild left ventricular hypertrophy but no other significant abnormalities.

The patient has been well-informed about the surgical procedure, its risks, and benefits. He has also been advised about the importance of adhering to strict fasting instructions prior to surgery, including avoiding food and drink after midnight the night before the procedure. He has consented to the surgery and understands the potential risks and complications associated with it.

During the surgery, general anesthesia will be administered, and the patient will be intubated to maintain airway patency and provide mechanical ventilation. Intravenous fluids and antibiotics will be given as per standard protocol. The surgical team will use sterile techniques and take necessary precautions to prevent infection.

Postoperatively, the patient will be monitored closely in the surgical recovery unit. Pain management will be provided through the use of analgesics, and measures will be taken to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. The patient will be encouraged to ambulate early to prevent complications and promote healing.

On the second day after surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, with a rise in serum creatinine levels by 50% from baseline. He also experienced a decrease in urine output, which raised concerns about kidney function. The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and stimulate urine production. His medications were reviewed, and those with potential nephrotoxic effects were discontinued.

Further investigations revealed that the patient's acute renal failure was likely multifactorial in nature, resulting from a combination of decreased renal perfusion during surgery, exposure to contrast dye during a preoperative imaging study, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for postoperative pain management. The patient was closely monitored for fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and his renal function was assessed daily.

During his hospitalization, the patient required renal replacement therapy in the form of continuous renal replacement therapy. This was initiated to help manage the complications of acute renal failure, including severe electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload. The patient's condition gradually improved, and his renal function started to recover.

After five days of renal replacement therapy, the patient's urine output began to increase, and his serum creatinine levels started to decline. The decision was made to discontinue renal replacement therapy, and the patient was transferred to the general medical floor for further monitoring and care.

Throughout his hospitalization, the patient received frequent visits from his family, who provided emotional support and helped ensure his comfort. In addition, the nursing staff provided education regarding the patient's medications, dietary modifications, and the importance of follow-up care and close monitoring of his renal function.

At discharge, the patient was advised to continue taking his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications as prescribed. He was also instructed to limit his intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to report any signs or symptoms of worsening renal function promptly. The patient was scheduled for follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and a nephrologist to monitor his renal function and address any complications that may arise.

In summary, this patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He is scheduled for surgery to repair a hernia and had an uneventful intraoperative period. However, he subsequently developed acute renal failure likely due to a combination of factors including decreased renal perfusion, exposure to contrast dye, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient required renal replacement therapy but eventually started to show signs of recovery. Close monitoring and follow-up care are essential to ensure his renal function continues to improve.
