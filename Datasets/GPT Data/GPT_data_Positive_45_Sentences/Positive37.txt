This patient is a 56-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been on antihypertensive medications since then.

Regarding his diabetes, the patient was diagnosed 15 years ago and has been managing it with insulin injections. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, which was diagnosed five years ago. The patient has undergone a coronary angioplasty and stent placement procedure for the treatment of his coronary artery disease.

In addition to these chronic conditions, the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50 mL/min/1.73mÂ². The patient has been closely monitored by a nephrologist, and his kidney function has remained relatively stable over the past year.

Prior to the surgery, the patient's medical team made sure to optimize his medical management. His blood pressure and blood sugar levels were well-controlled, and he was advised to continue taking his medications as prescribed. The patient was also educated about the importance of maintaining good glycemic control to prevent any post-surgical complications.

During the surgery, the patient experienced a complication known as acute renal failure. This complication is characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function, resulting in the accumulation of waste products and fluid imbalance. Acute renal failure can occur due to various factors, including decreased blood flow to the kidneys during surgery, the use of certain medications, or underlying kidney disease.

The patient presented with symptoms of acute renal failure, including decreased urine output, increased swelling, and rising levels of creatinine in the blood. Immediate medical intervention was initiated to address the underlying cause and manage the complication.

The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit and was started on intravenous fluids to increase blood flow to the kidneys and promote renal function. Diuretics were also administered to help improve urine output and remove excess fluid from the body.

Further investigations were performed to determine the specific cause of the acute renal failure. These included imaging studies to assess the blood flow to the kidneys, and blood tests to assess kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes such as urinary tract obstruction or medication-induced kidney injury.

The patient's condition gradually improved with appropriate management. His urine output increased, and his swelling started to subside. Blood tests showed a gradual decrease in creatinine levels, indicating improved kidney function.

Throughout the recovery period, the patient remained on close surveillance by the nephrology team. This included regular blood tests to monitor kidney function and ensure that the patient's condition continued to improve.

The patient was also educated about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including proper hydration and avoiding medications that may be harmful to renal function. He was advised to follow a low-sodium diet and limit his intake of protein and potassium to prevent further strain on the kidneys.

The patient's care plan also involved regular follow-up visits with the nephrologist post-surgery to assess his kidney function and adjust his medications as needed. Extra caution was taken to avoid any potential nephrotoxic medications that could further worsen kidney function.

In conclusion, this patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. Despite careful preoperative preparation, the patient developed acute renal failure during surgery. He received prompt medical intervention, including intravenous fluids and diuretics, leading to an improvement in kidney function. The patient was closely monitored post-surgery and provided with appropriate education and follow-up care to prevent further complications and promote a successful recovery.
