The patient is a 50-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. He has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The patient is currently on several medications, including an antihypertensive medication and a statin for his cholesterol. He is also taking a medication for his obesity.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has had surgery in the past for a gallbladder removal. The surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient recovered well. He has no known allergies to any medications or surgical materials.

On physical examination, the patient is obese with a BMI of 32. He has no significant findings on examination related to his hernia.

Laboratory investigations were conducted, and the patient's complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation profile were within normal limits. His baseline renal function was also normal, with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient was advised to undergo preoperative testing, including an electrocardiogram and a chest x-ray. Both tests showed no abnormalities.

To minimize the risk of complications during surgery, the patient was advised to stop taking his antihypertensive medication a day before the surgery. He was also advised to continue taking his other medications, including the statin and the obesity medication.

During the surgery, the patient was given general anesthesia. The procedure was completed without any complications, and the patient was stable throughout.

Unfortunately, the patient developed acute renal failure a day after the surgery. His urine output decreased significantly, and his serum creatinine level increased to 2.5 mg/dL. His blood pressure also became elevated.

The patient was immediately managed by a nephrologist. He was started on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and optimize renal perfusion. He was also started on diuretics to promote urine output.

Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of the acute renal failure. The patient's renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys with no evidence of obstruction. His urine analysis showed no red or white blood cells, ruling out any possible urinary tract infection or renal stone. His urine electrolyte levels were also within normal limits.

Given the patient's history of hypertension, it was suspected that the acute renal failure may be due to the surgery-related hemodynamic changes and decreased renal perfusion. The patient's antihypertensive medication was restarted to control his blood pressure.

The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next few days. His urine output increased, and his serum creatinine level began to decrease. He remained under the care of the nephrologist for close monitoring.

The patient was eventually discharged from the hospital with improved renal function. He was advised to continue taking his antihypertensive medication and to follow up with the nephrologist for further evaluation.

In conclusion, this patient's medical history includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, with a prior surgical history of gallbladder removal. He underwent surgery for a hernia repair and developed acute renal failure postoperatively, which was managed successfully with hydration, diuretics, and resumption of antihypertensive medication. The patient's renal function improved, and he was discharged with instructions for follow-up.
