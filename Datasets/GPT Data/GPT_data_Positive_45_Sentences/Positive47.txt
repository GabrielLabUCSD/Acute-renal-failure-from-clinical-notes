The patient has had a previous surgery for appendicitis 20 years ago, and a cholecystectomy 15 years ago.
He has been experiencing increasing chronic pain in his knee over the past year, which led him to seek the recommendation of an orthopedic surgeon who recommended a knee replacement surgery.
The patient's preoperative labs show normal liver and kidney function, but he has an elevated fasting blood glucose level and elevated blood pressure.
EKG and stress test showed no signs of cardiac risk. Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.
The patient is currently taking lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin for his chronic conditions.

The patient's BMI is 32, indicating that he is significantly overweight.
He has been advised to lose weight but has had difficulty making lifestyle changes to achieve this.
The patient has undergone preoperative counseling regarding the risks and benefits of the surgery, as well as the postoperative recovery process.
He has been advised to stop taking his metformin and atorvastatin a week before the surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding and interactions with anesthesia.
The patient has been instructed to continue taking his lisinopril up until the day of surgery.
He has been told to avoid any food or drink after midnight the night before the surgery.
His surgical team has made arrangements for him to receive appropriate anesthesia during the procedure.
The patient will be monitored closely during and after the surgery to ensure his vital signs remain stable.
Postoperative pain management will be provided through a combination of oral and intravenous medications.
The patient has been informed about the potential risks and complications of the surgery, including infection, bleeding, and blood clots.
He has been advised to take measures to prevent blood clots, such as wearing compression stockings and moving around as soon as possible after the surgery.

After surgery, the patient experienced some complications, including acute renal failure.
His urine output decreased significantly, and his creatinine level spiked.
The patient was started on intravenous fluids and diuretics to improve his kidney function.
He was closely monitored for any signs of electrolyte imbalances or worsening kidney function.
The patient was also referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of his acute renal failure.
A renal ultrasound was performed to assess the structure and function of his kidneys.
The ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction or other abnormalities that could explain his acute renal failure.
The patient's renal function gradually improved with medical management, and his urine output and creatinine level returned to baseline.
He was discharged from the hospital with follow-up instructions to continue close monitoring of his renal function.
The patient was also provided with education on maintaining kidney health, including staying well-hydrated and avoiding nephrotoxic medications.
He was given a list of medications to avoid or use with caution to prevent further damage to his kidneys.
The patient has since been following up with his nephrologist and primary care physician regularly to monitor his renal function and manage his chronic conditions.
Overall, the patient's surgery and postoperative recovery were complicated by acute renal failure, but his renal function has since improved.
