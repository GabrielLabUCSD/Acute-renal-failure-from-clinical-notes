The patient is a 65-year-old male who has a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity.

He has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents for his diabetes and antihypertensive medications for his hypertension.

The patient has a BMI of 32, which puts him in the obese category.

He has been advised by his healthcare provider to lose weight for his general health but has not been successful in his attempts to do so.

His blood pressure has been well-controlled on his current medication regimen.

His diabetes has been relatively well-controlled with an average HbA1c level of 7.5%.

The patient has no history of renal disease or any previous surgeries.

He reports intermittent episodes of chest pain on exertion for the past year.

An exercise stress test revealed significant ST-segment depressions during exercise.

A coronary angiogram was performed, revealing a 90% stenosis in his left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient was started on aspirin, a beta-blocker, and a statin medication for his coronary artery disease.

He was also advised to undergo a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery to bypass the affected artery.

Due to his significant coronary artery disease, the patient is considered high-risk for surgery.

Preoperative tests were performed, including blood work, chest x-ray, and an electrocardiogram, which were all within normal limits.

The patient's renal function tests also came back normal.

He was cleared for surgery by a cardiologist and an anesthesiologist.

The patient was counseled on the risks and benefits of the surgery and provided informed consent.

He was scheduled for surgery the following week.

The patient underwent an uneventful CABG surgery and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative care.

In the ICU, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was monitored closely for any signs of complications.

On the second postoperative day, the patient's urine output decreased significantly, and he developed signs of fluid overload.

His serum creatinine level increased from 1.0 mg/dL preoperatively to 2.5 mg/dL.

His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level also increased from 15 mg/dL preoperatively to 40 mg/dL.

These findings were consistent with acute renal failure.

The patient was started on diuretic therapy to manage his fluid overload.

He was also given intravenous fluids to maintain his fluid balance.

A nephrologist was consulted for further management of the patient's renal failure.

The nephrologist recommended discontinuing any nephrotoxic medications and closely monitoring the patient's renal function.

The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next few days, and his urine output returned to normal.

His serum creatinine level decreased to 1.2 mg/dL, and his BUN level normalized.

The patient was discharged from the hospital with instructions to follow up with the nephrologist and his primary care provider for regular monitoring of his renal function.

He was also advised to continue taking his postoperative medications, including aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin.

The patient was instructed to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen to manage his diabetes and hypertension.

He was counseled on the importance of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight to reduce the risk of future surgeries and complications.

The patient expressed understanding and commitment to making necessary lifestyle changes.

A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks post-discharge to assess his progress and adjust his medications if needed.

The patient's family was also educated on the signs and symptoms of renal failure and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention if any concerns arise.

Overall, the patient's surgery was successful, but he experienced an episode of acute renal failure postoperatively.

With appropriate management and follow-up, the patient's renal function improved, and he was discharged with a plan for continued care.
