The patient is a middle-aged male who is planning to undergo surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. 

He has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years, which have been effective in controlling his blood pressure. He takes metformin for his diabetes and manages his condition through diet and exercise. 

Despite these efforts, his blood sugar levels have been slightly elevated in recent months, and his physician has recommended initiating insulin therapy prior to surgery to achieve better glycemic control.

The patient has also struggled with weight management over the years and has a body mass index (BMI) of 35. This places him in the category of class II obesity. 

He has been advised to lose weight prior to surgery to reduce the risk of complications. He has been attending regular appointments with a nutritionist and has successfully lost 10 pounds over the past three months.

Additionally, the patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night to aid in breathing. He has been compliant with this treatment and reports improved sleep quality and decreased daytime sleepiness.

The patient has no known drug allergies and provides a comprehensive list of his current medications, which includes lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, and aspirin.

He reports occasional mild joint pain, for which he takes over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed. His last routine laboratory tests, which include a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and lipid profile, were within normal limits.

The patient also had an echocardiogram a year ago, which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction. He denies any history of heart attacks, angina, or other cardiovascular events.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has had two previous surgeries. Five years ago, he underwent an appendectomy for acute appendicitis. He experienced no complications during or after the procedure.

Two years ago, he underwent a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones. Again, he made an uncomplicated recovery and had no further issues related to his gallbladder.

The patient does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit substances. He enjoys an active lifestyle and regularly participates in low-impact exercises such as swimming and walking. He does not have a family history of any significant medical conditions.

During the preoperative evaluation, the patient appears anxious but cooperative. He has a good understanding of the surgical procedure and the expected postoperative course. He asks questions regarding pain management and potential complications.

Lab results from the preoperative workup show slightly elevated fasting blood sugar levels, prompting the medication adjustment to include insulin therapy. His hemoglobin A1C, which reflects blood sugar control over the past few months, is within the target range.

His liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrolyte levels are normal. His CBC shows a mild elevation in white blood cell count, which is likely due to stress and anxiety associated with the upcoming surgery.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no significant findings. His vital signs are stable, and he is afebrile.

Based on his medical history, the patient is at an increased risk for developing complications post-surgery. His obesity, diabetes, and hypertension may impair wound healing and increase the risk of infections. Additionally, his obstructive sleep apnea may lead to respiratory issues during and after surgery.

The surgical team will need to be aware of these risk factors to ensure proper perioperative management. Measures such as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, strict glycemic control, and optimization of blood pressure should be implemented to minimize complications.

Following surgery, the patient's recovery initially goes well. However, two days postoperatively, he develops signs of acute renal failure. His urine output decreases, and his serum creatinine levels rise significantly.

Further investigations reveal that he has developed acute tubular necrosis, a type of kidney injury often seen after surgery. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including intraoperative hypotension, prolonged surgery duration, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.

The patient is promptly started on intravenous fluids, and the underlying cause of his acute renal failure is addressed. He is closely monitored by nephrology and urology specialists.

Due to his acute renal failure, the patient requires dialysis to support his kidney function until recovery occurs. He is informed of the need for dialysis and is started on hemodialysis, which takes place three times a week.

Over the next few weeks, the patient's renal function gradually improves, and his urine output begins to normalize. Laboratory tests show a decline in serum creatinine levels, indicating renal recovery.

During this time, the patient continues to receive supportive care, including regular monitoring of electrolyte levels, blood pressure control, and adjustment of medications based on renal function.

With appropriate management, the patient's renal function continues to improve, and he is eventually weaned off hemodialysis. He requires close follow-up to ensure long-term kidney health and prevent future episodes of acute renal failure.

In summary, the patient who is planning to have surgery has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity. He has been on antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications, with recent initiation of insulin therapy for improved glycemic control.

He also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, which is managed with a CPAP machine. His previous surgeries (appendectomy and cholecystectomy) were uneventful. He maintains an active lifestyle, follows a well-balanced diet, and attends regular appointments with his healthcare providers.

However, despite these precautions, the patient experiences acute renal failure after surgery, likely due to multiple factors. His recovery from renal failure involves dialysis and close monitoring to ensure long-term kidney health.
