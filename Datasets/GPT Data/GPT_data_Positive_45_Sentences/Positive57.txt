The patient, aged 55, is preparing to undergo surgery for an undisclosed condition. Their medical history reveals various notable aspects. The patient has a history of diabetes, which has been managed with oral medications for the past 10 years. They also have a known allergy to penicillin, with a previous documented reaction of hives.

In terms of surgeries, the patient has undergone a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) due to gallstones two years ago. There were no complications during or after the surgery. Additionally, the patient had a knee replacement surgery five years ago due to severe osteoarthritis. The procedure was successful, and the patient experienced a smooth recovery process.

Apart from these surgical interventions, the patient has a history of hypertension for which they have been taking medication for seven years. To monitor their blood pressure, the patient regularly checks it at home and reports values within a normal range. The patient also has a history of high cholesterol and takes statins to manage this condition. Their most recent lipid profile results were within the target range.

In terms of their renal function, the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3, which was diagnosed three years ago. During routine follow-up visits, their renal function tests have consistently shown a slightly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of around 55ml/min. They have managed their CKD with dietary modifications and regular monitoring of their kidney function.

A notable complication following surgery that the patient experienced in the past was acute postoperative pain, which was managed with appropriate analgesics. Additionally, during the knee replacement surgery, the patient developed a superficial surgical site infection, which was successfully treated with antibiotics.

After the surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure, also known as acute kidney injury (AKI). This complication was likely multifactorial, with possible contributions from the surgery itself, perioperative hypotension, and the patient's pre-existing CKD. The acute renal failure manifested with elevated serum creatinine levels, decreased urine output, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient required close monitoring and aggressive management, including intravenous fluids and diuretics, to support kidney function and promote recovery. With appropriate intervention, the patient's renal function gradually improved, and they were discharged from the hospital after five days with stable kidney function.

Given the patient's medical history, surgical experience, and previous complication of acute renal failure, it is crucial for the medical team to carefully plan and execute the upcoming surgery. They should ensure adequate perioperative fluid management, monitor blood pressure closely, and consider the patient's kidney function when selecting appropriate medications. The anesthesiologist should also be aware of the patient's allergy to penicillin to avoid any adverse reactions during the surgery.
