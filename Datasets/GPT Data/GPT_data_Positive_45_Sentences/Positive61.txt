The patient, a 72-year-old male, is currently planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In terms of his hypertension, he has been on antihypertensive medications for the past 10 years to control his blood pressure. His blood pressure readings have been well-maintained within normal ranges, and he has not experienced any recent hypertensive crises.

Regarding his COPD, the patient has a long history of cigarette smoking for over 40 years, which led to his diagnosis. He is currently on bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids to manage his symptoms, which mainly include wheezing and shortness of breath with exertion. He has had no recent exacerbations or significant worsening in his respiratory function.

His coronary artery disease was diagnosed 5 years ago, following an episode of chest pain and subsequent angiography revealing significant stenosis. The patient subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and has been on dual antiplatelet therapy since then. He reports no angina symptoms since the surgery, and his recent stress test showed no evidence of ischemia.

In terms of his diabetes, the patient has had a long-standing history of poorly controlled blood sugar levels. He has been on multiple oral hypoglycemic agents, but his primary care physician recently initiated insulin therapy due to worsening glycemic control. The patient reports occasional episodes of hypoglycemia but has otherwise managed his diabetes relatively well.

Laboratory investigations conducted prior to surgery revealed normal renal function with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 80 mL/min/1.73m².

Unfortunately, postoperatively, the patient experienced acute renal failure as a complication. He presented with a sudden decrease in urine output, lower back pain, and generalized swelling. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated serum creatinine levels of 2.3 mg/dL and a decreased eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73m².

The patient was promptly diagnosed with acute renal failure, and the possible causes were explored. It was determined that the most likely cause was acute tubular necrosis secondary to prolonged hypotension during the surgery and the use of nephrotoxic medications postoperatively.

Management of the patient's acute renal failure involved fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids and the discontinuation of any nephrotoxic medications. Daily laboratory monitoring was initiated to assess renal function and guide further management. The patient was also referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of renal function.

Over the next few days, the patient's renal function gradually improved. His urine output increased, and his serum creatinine levels began to decline. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, was not required in this case.

To prevent further complications and protect his renal function, the patient was advised to maintain adequate hydration and avoid any nephrotoxic substances, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and contrast agents. His primary care physician also adjusted his medications to minimize any potential adverse effects on his kidneys.

Close follow-up was scheduled with both his surgical team and nephrologist to monitor his renal function and ensure proper ongoing care. The patient was educated on the importance of adhering to his prescribed medications, managing his chronic conditions, and seeking immediate medical attention if any signs or symptoms of renal dysfunction recurred.

In conclusion, this 72-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, COPD, coronary artery disease, and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. Unfortunately, he developed acute renal failure as a postoperative complication, most likely due to prolonged hypotension during surgery and the use of nephrotoxic medications. His renal function gradually improved with supportive management, and he was advised to maintain renal protective measures and close follow-up with his healthcare team.
