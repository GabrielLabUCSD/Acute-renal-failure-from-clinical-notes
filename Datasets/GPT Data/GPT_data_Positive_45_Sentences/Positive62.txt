Patient X is a 57-year-old male who is planning to have surgery for a hernia repair. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which are well-controlled with medication. He has a past surgical history of appendectomy and prostatectomy.

On physical examination, Patient X is found to be in overall good health, with vital signs within normal limits. His cardiovascular system is unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and no murmurs or abnormal rhythms. He has no respiratory symptoms, and his lungs are clear on auscultation. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no palpable masses or organomegaly. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits.

In terms of laboratory findings, Patient X has a complete blood count within normal limits, with a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL and no evidence of anemia. His electrolyte panel shows normal levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride. His renal function tests are also within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 92 mL/min/1.73m².

Patient X is scheduled to undergo surgery in two weeks. In preparation for the procedure, he is advised to discontinue his antiplatelet medication, aspirin, for a week before the surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding. He is also instructed to fast for at least six hours before the surgery.

However, following the surgery, Patient X experiences complications in the form of acute renal failure. This is characterized by a rapid decline in his kidney function, leading to the accumulation of waste products and fluid imbalances in his body. The most common cause of acute renal failure in the postoperative setting is acute tubular necrosis, which can be precipitated by hypotension, hypovolemia, or the administration of nephrotoxic medications.

The symptoms of acute renal failure include a decrease in urine output, swelling of the hands and feet, fatigue, shortness of breath, confusion, and nausea. On examination, Patient X is found to have edema, particularly around his lower extremities and periorbital region. His blood pressure is also noted to be elevated, and he has signs of fluid overload.

Laboratory investigations reveal significant changes in his renal function tests. His serum creatinine level has risen to 3.2 mg/dL, and his eGFR has decreased to 25 mL/min/1.73m². He also has an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 60 mg/dL.

To manage Patient X's acute renal failure, several interventions are implemented. He is placed on strict fluid restriction to help alleviate the fluid overload and prevent further kidney damage. Diuretic medication, such as furosemide, is administered to promote diuresis and decrease edema.

In addition, the underlying cause of the acute renal failure is addressed. Patient X's blood pressure is carefully controlled with antihypertensive medications, and his volume status is closely monitored. The nephrotoxic medications are discontinued, and alternative medications that are less harmful to the kidneys are prescribed.

Patient X is also referred to a nephrologist for further management and monitoring of his renal function. He undergoes regular renal function tests, including serum creatinine and BUN levels, to assess the progression of his kidney injury.

Overall, Patient X's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, along with his well-controlled medical conditions, suggest that he is a suitable candidate for surgery. However, the development of acute renal failure postoperatively necessitates careful management and close monitoring to optimize his kidney health and prevent further complications.
