The patient is a 65-year-old male who is scheduled to undergo surgery.

He has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

His hypertension is well-controlled with medication, including amlodipine and lisinopril.

He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago and has been managing it with diet, exercise, and metformin. His most recent HbA1c level was 7.3%.

His hyperlipidemia is also well-managed with medication, including atorvastatin.

The patient has a history of smoking for 30 years but quit 10 years ago.

He denies any history of cardiovascular disease or previous surgeries.

He has no known allergies to medications.

The patient's baseline vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

His physical examination is unremarkable, except for some mild peripheral edema.

Laboratory studies show a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, and normal electrolyte levels.

Renal function tests prior to surgery reveal a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 70 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Based on the patient's medical history and preoperative evaluation, he is deemed to be a suitable candidate for surgery.

After undergoing surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure as a complication.

He presents with oliguria, with urine output less than 500 mL per day.

The patient's laboratory studies reveal an abrupt increase in serum creatinine level to 3.2 mg/dL.

His electrolyte levels show hyperkalemia, with potassium levels of 5.6 mEq/L.

The patient's blood pressure drops significantly, with a reading of 90/60 mmHg.

He develops metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.2 and a bicarbonate level of 18 mEq/L.

Further evaluation reveals a urine sediment with granular casts, indicating acute tubular necrosis as the cause of his acute renal failure.

The patient is immediately started on intravenous fluids to restore his volume status.

He is also given furosemide to promote diuresis and remove the buildup of waste products.

In addition, the patient is started on hemodialysis to further support his failing kidneys.

His electrolyte imbalances are managed with medications, including potassium binders and bicarbonate supplementation.

Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status, vital signs, and renal function tests is performed throughout his hospital stay.

Gradually, the patient's urine output begins to improve, and his serum creatinine level starts to normalize.

He remains on hemodialysis for a total of 8 days before his renal function recovers sufficiently.

During his hospitalization, the patient's blood pressure is closely monitored and managed with antihypertensive medications.

His blood glucose levels are also closely controlled with insulin therapy.

The patient's overall condition gradually improves, and he is able to be discharged from the hospital.

Prior to discharge, the patient is educated on the importance of continuing his medications and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise.

He is instructed to follow up with his primary care physician and nephrologist to monitor his renal function and manage his hypertension and diabetes.

The patient is also advised to avoid any nephrotoxic medications or substances that could further harm his kidneys.

In conclusion, the patient has a complex medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medications.

Despite the preoperative evaluation suggesting the patient was a suitable candidate for surgery, he developed acute renal failure as a complication after surgery.

Prompt recognition and management of his acute renal failure, including intravenous fluids, diuretics, and hemodialysis, led to an improvement in his renal function.

The patient was ultimately able to be discharged from the hospital but will require close follow-up and ongoing management of his medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and renal function.
