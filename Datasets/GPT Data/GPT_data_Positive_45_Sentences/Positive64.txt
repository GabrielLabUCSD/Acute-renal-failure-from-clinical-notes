The patient is a 60-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been on antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years and his blood pressure has been well controlled. He has been managing his diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents and his blood glucose levels have been well regulated. His hyperlipidemia has been controlled with statin therapy and his lipid profile has been within normal limits.

The patient has also had a previous surgical history. He underwent cholecystectomy for gallstones 5 years ago and had an uneventful recovery. He has no known drug allergies or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

In terms of lifestyle, the patient is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol 2-3 times per week in moderation. He does not use recreational drugs.

The patient is currently asymptomatic and not experiencing any health issues. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or syncope. He has a regular exercise routine and feels well overall.

In terms of family history, the patient's father has a history of coronary artery disease, but his mother and siblings are healthy. There is no family history of renal or liver disease.

Pre-operative investigations were performed, including routine blood work, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. All investigations were within normal limits, indicating that the patient is medically stable.

During the surgery, the patient experienced a complication in the form of acute renal failure. This was characterized by a sudden decline in kidney function and an elevation in serum creatinine levels. The patient developed oliguria, with a urine output of less than 400 ml per day.

The cause of the acute renal failure was believed to be multifactorial. The patient had a history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which are known risk factors for renal complications. Additionally, the surgery itself, along with the perioperative use of nephrotoxic medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and contrast agents, may have contributed to the development of acute renal failure.

The patient was closely monitored in the post-operative period. Hemodialysis was initiated to manage the acute renal failure and to support kidney function. Fluid and electrolyte balance was carefully maintained to optimize renal function.

During the hospital stay, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and there were no significant changes in his cardiac status. The patient's blood pressure was well controlled with antihypertensive medications. Additionally, his blood glucose levels were carefully monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia, which can further worsen renal function.

The patient's renal function showed gradual improvement over the course of his hospital stay. The urine output gradually increased and serum creatinine levels began to decrease. The patient was weaned off hemodialysis and was transitioned to conservative management.

As part of the management plan, the patient was advised to follow a renal-friendly diet, with restriction of protein, phosphorus, and sodium intake. He was also prescribed medications to optimize his renal function, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to control blood pressure and protect kidney function.

During follow-up visits, the patient's renal function continued to improve. His urine output returned to normal and serum creatinine levels normalized. The patient was advised to continue with his renal-friendly diet, medication regimen, and regular follow-up appointments to monitor his renal function closely. He was educated on the importance of maintaining good renal health and was advised to continue his healthy lifestyle habits, including regular exercise and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.

In conclusion, this patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia is planning to undergo surgery. He developed a complication of acute renal failure post-operatively, which was managed with close monitoring, hemodialysis, and supportive care. His renal function gradually improved and he was advised to continue with a renal-friendly diet and medication regimen to optimize his kidney health. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his renal function closely.
