The patient in question is preparing to undergo surgery and has a comprehensive medical history. The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.

Over the past year, the patient has been following a strict diet and exercise regimen to manage his chronic conditions. His blood pressure has been well-controlled with medication, with recent readings consistently below 130/80 mmHg. Additionally, his blood glucose levels have been stable, with an average HbA1c of 6.5%.

The patient's lipid profile is within the target range, and he takes a statin medication to manage his hyperlipidemia. He reports no recent cardiovascular events or symptoms of angina. His exercise tolerance is good, and he can walk up to one mile without experiencing chest pain or shortness of breath.

In terms of surgical history, the patient had an appendectomy in his early 20s but has not required any other surgeries. He does not have any known drug allergies, and his baseline laboratory parameters are within normal limits. He has not experienced any recent infections, and his immunization status is up to date.

The patient's vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, are currently stable. He has not experienced any significant weight loss or gain in the past year.

Given his stable medical background, the patient has been cleared by both his primary care physician and his cardiologist for surgery. They have emphasized the importance of strict blood glucose control perioperatively to minimize the risk of infection, delayed wound healing, and poor outcomes.

However, the patient experienced an unfortunate complication following his surgery in the form of acute renal failure. This occurred due to a combination of factors, including prolonged hypotension during the surgery, use of nephrotoxic medications, and underlying chronic kidney disease.

The patient's creatinine levels began to rise postoperatively, and he developed oliguria. His urine output was consistently below 500 mL/day, indicating decreased kidney function. Imaging studies revealed bilateral renal cortical necrosis, likely secondary to ischemia.

Hemodialysis was initiated promptly to manage the acute renal failure. The patient was closely monitored for fluid and electrolyte imbalances, while his medications were adjusted accordingly.

The cause of the renal failure was communicated to the patient and his family, along with the potential outcomes and treatment options available. The patient is currently undergoing regular dialysis sessions to support his renal function.

Ongoing management involves collaboration between nephrologists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists to optimize the patient's care. As the patient has stable chronic conditions, these specialists aim to address the acute renal failure while maintaining the patient's overall health status.

The patient's family has been involved in the discussion of the treatment plan, and their support has been invaluable. They are actively participating in education sessions regarding renal care and are involved in decision-making regarding further management.

The patient's prognosis depends on various factors, including the extent of renal injury, underlying medical conditions, and response to treatment. The patient's care team will continue to provide regular updates on his progress and modify the treatment plan as necessary.

In conclusion, the patient scheduled for surgery has a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. Despite these chronic conditions, his overall health has been well-managed. Unfortunately, he experienced acute renal failure postoperatively and is currently undergoing hemodialysis as part of his treatment. The patient's care is a collaborative effort between multiple specialists, with ongoing communication and involvement of the patient's family. Prognosis remains uncertain and will depend on the response to treatment and management of underlying conditions.
