The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 58-year-old male who is planning to have surgery. He has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia. Mr. Smith has been managing these conditions with medication and lifestyle modifications for the past 10 years.

In terms of his cardiovascular health, Mr. Smith has had several episodes of angina in the past, but he has not had any recent cardiac events. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease five years ago and has been on a statin medication to manage his cholesterol levels.

Furthermore, Mr. Smith has a history of smoking, although he managed to quit two years ago. He has a 15 pack-year smoking history. He has been actively participating in a smoking cessation program and has been smoke-free for the past two years.

Mr. Smith also has a history of chronic kidney disease. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been steadily declining. At present, his eGFR is 40 mL/min/1.73mÂ², indicating stage 3 chronic kidney disease. He is being closely monitored by a nephrologist and is following a low-protein diet to manage his kidney function.

Additionally, Mr. Smith has a history of mild asthma, but he rarely experiences symptoms. He carries a rescue inhaler for occasional use.

On reviewing his surgical history, Mr. Smith underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy six years ago due to gallstones. The surgery was successful, and he had an uneventful recovery.

Apart from these conditions, Mr. Smith has no known drug allergies. He currently takes several medications, including metformin for diabetes, enalapril for hypertension, atorvastatin for dyslipidemia, and a daily aspirin for cardiovascular protection.

During the preoperative evaluation, Mr. Smith's blood work revealed normal hemoglobin and platelet counts. However, his serum creatinine level was found to be slightly elevated at 1.4 mg/dL. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no signs of cardiac abnormalities, and his chest x-ray was clear.

The anesthesiologist reviewed his medical history and noted his chronic kidney disease. Given this history, the anesthesiologist plans to monitor Mr. Smith's fluid status closely during and after surgery to prevent any potential complications.

Following the surgery, Mr. Smith experienced acute renal failure, likely due to the surgical procedure. His serum creatinine level increased to 3.1 mg/dL, and he also developed oliguria, having significantly reduced urine output. To address this complication, the nephrology team was consulted.

Mr. Smith was started on intravenous fluids and a diuretic medication to promote urine output. His kidney function was closely monitored, including regular measurements of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine output.

Over the next few days, Mr. Smith's renal function gradually improved. His urine output increased, and his serum creatinine level decreased to 2.0 mg/dL. The diuretic medication was tapered off, and he was shifted to oral fluids.

Throughout the recovery period, Mr. Smith's vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any cardiovascular or respiratory complications. He was encouraged to ambulate and practice deep breathing exercises to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.

The surgical wound appeared to be healing well, and no signs of infection or wound dehiscence were noted. The patient reported mild pain at the surgical site, which was managed with oral analgesics.

Mr. Smith's renal function continued to improve, and his urine output gradually returned to normal levels. His serum creatinine level decreased further to 1.6 mg/dL.

During his hospital stay, Mr. Smith received education regarding his condition and strategies for managing chronic kidney disease at home. He was advised to continue his low-protein diet and take prescribed medications regularly to optimize his kidney function.

Upon discharge, Mr. Smith was provided with a follow-up appointment with the nephrologist and urologist to monitor his renal function closely. He was also given a prescription for his regular medications, including adjustments to his insulin and oral antidiabetic agents to maintain proper glycemic control.

In conclusion, Mr. Smith, a 58-year-old male who presented for surgery, has a complex medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, a smoking history, and a remote history of coronary artery disease and asthma. Although the surgery went well, he experienced acute renal failure as a complication postoperatively. However, his renal function gradually improved with appropriate interventions, and he was discharged with a plan for further monitoring and management of his chronic kidney disease.
