The patient in question is a 60-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a knee replacement. He has a history of hypertension and is currently taking medication for it, including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient also has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on metformin and insulin therapy to manage his blood sugar levels.

In terms of surgical history, the patient has undergone a cholecystectomy for gallstones in the past. He has no known allergies to medications or any significant family history of medical conditions. The patient has been referred to a surgeon by his orthopedist due to debilitating pain and decreased mobility in his right knee, which significantly impacts his daily activities.

The patient's current vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits, with no evidence of infection or other acute medical issues. The pre-operative lab work shows a fasting blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated but manageable. The patient's HbA1c level, which indicates long-term blood sugar control, is 7.2%, indicating fair glycemic control.

The patient's renal function tests, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, are within the normal range. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is also within normal limits, suggesting good kidney function. However, due to his history of hypertension and diabetes, the patient is at increased risk for acute kidney injury following surgery.

To mitigate this risk, the patient's medications are being carefully managed, and his blood pressure and blood sugar levels are being closely monitored in the perioperative period. The surgical team will also take steps to ensure adequate hydration and minimize the use of potentially nephrotoxic agents during the procedure.

Following the surgery, the patient develops acute renal failure, characterized by a sudden decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine and BUN levels. Acute renal failure can occur as a result of hypoperfusion during surgery, complications of anesthesia, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.

To manage the patient's acute renal failure, he is transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and stabilization. Intravenous fluids are administered to optimize his intravascular volume and restore renal perfusion. Diuretics may be used to promote urine output and remove excess fluid and waste products. 

The patient is also placed on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to provide hemodynamic and metabolic support while simultaneously managing his renal failure. Ongoing laboratory monitoring is performed to assess renal function and guide treatment adjustments as needed. 

Additionally, the patient's underlying chronic conditions, hypertension, and diabetes, must be managed appropriately while he recovers from surgery and acute renal failure. Blood pressure control is crucial to prevent further renal damage, and antihypertensive medications are adjusted accordingly. Blood glucose levels are also closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy to ensure optimal glycemic control.

Rehabilitation and physical therapy are initiated to aid in the patient's recovery and optimize his knee function post-surgery. The patient is closely followed up by both his surgical and nephrology teams to monitor his progress and initiate any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan.

Overall, this patient's medical history, including hypertension and diabetes, presents unique challenges in the perioperative period. The development of acute renal failure following surgery further complicates his management and necessitates prompt intervention and close monitoring to prevent long-term renal damage. The interdisciplinary approach involving multiple specialists is essential to provide optimal care and ensure the patient's successful recovery.
