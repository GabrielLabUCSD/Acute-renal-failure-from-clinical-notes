The patient is a 55-year-old male who has a long history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and obesity. He has been struggling to manage his blood sugar levels and currently takes metformin, glipizide, and insulin. He also takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for his hypertension. Despite efforts to lose weight, the patient's body mass index remains in the obese range.

Due to his medical history and ongoing health issues, the patient has been advised to undergo surgery for his chronic knee pain. The surgical team has planned for a total knee replacement surgery in order to alleviate his pain and improve his mobility. During the pre-operative assessment, the patient mentioned that he had successfully gone through an appendectomy a few years ago without any complications.

On further examination, it was discovered that the patient's renal function was slightly impaired, with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 mL/min/1.73m2. The nephrologist determined that the patient had stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) a few months ago, for which he received a course of antibiotics.

The surgical team carefully evaluated the patient's renal function and believed that he was at a moderate risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF) post-surgery due to his pre-existing renal dysfunction. In order to minimize this risk, the patient was advised to maintain good hydration, avoid nephrotoxic agents, and have close monitoring of his renal function during the perioperative period.

The surgery proceeded as planned, and the patient underwent general anesthesia for the total knee replacement. The procedure was successful, and the patient's knee pain was significantly reduced post-surgery. He started physical therapy the next day to regain strength and mobility.

However, on the second post-operative day, the patient started to experience decreased urine output and developed signs of fluid overload, such as peripheral edema and shortness of breath. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated serum creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to ischemia during the surgery.

The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids to correct his fluid imbalance and enhance renal perfusion. Diuretics were administered to help alleviate the fluid overload. The surgical team collaborated with the nephrologist to adjust the patient's medication regimen, ensuring that potentially nephrotoxic agents were discontinued or adjusted.

Regular monitoring of the patient's renal function was initiated, including daily urine output measurement and serial serum creatinine measurements. The nephrologist recommended renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the form of hemodialysis if the patient's renal function did not improve within the next 48 hours.

The patient's ARF was attributed to a combination of pre-existing chronic kidney disease, intraoperative hypotension, and the use of nephrotoxic medications. The patient received appropriate support and management to prevent further deterioration of his renal function.

After two days, the patient's renal function started to improve, with an increase in urine output and a decline in serum creatinine levels. The fluid overload gradually resolved, and the patient's peripheral edema reduced. The nephrologist decided to monitor the patient closely and postpone any decision regarding renal replacement therapy for now.

During his hospital stay, the patient received specialized care from a multidisciplinary team, including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and dietitians. His blood sugar levels were carefully managed, and insulin doses were adjusted as necessary. The patient was encouraged to continue his diabetes and hypertension management at home after discharge.

The physical therapists worked with the patient to regain strength and mobility in his new knee joint. They provided exercises and guidance to ensure a smooth recovery and minimize the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The patient also received dietary counseling from the dietitian to promote renal health and manage his diabetes and hypertension. He was advised to follow a low-sodium diet, restrict his protein intake, and increase his fluid intake to maintain hydration.

After a week of hospitalization and careful management, the patient's renal function continued to improve, and he was deemed stable enough for discharge. He was prescribed oral diuretics to help maintain fluid balance and advised to monitor his blood sugar levels closely. The patient was also educated on signs and symptoms of worsening renal function and instructed to seek medical attention if needed.

At the time of discharge, the patient's renal function had returned close to his pre-operative baseline, although he still had stage 3 CKD. The nephrologist recommended follow-up appointments to monitor his renal function and manage his kidney disease. The orthopedic surgeon scheduled regular check-ups to assess the patient's knee recovery and ensure there were no signs of prosthetic joint infection.

Overall, the patient's surgical experience was complicated by the development of acute renal failure, but with appropriate management and support, his renal function gradually improved. The patient was advised to continue managing his diabetes, hypertension, and renal health meticulously to minimize future complications.
