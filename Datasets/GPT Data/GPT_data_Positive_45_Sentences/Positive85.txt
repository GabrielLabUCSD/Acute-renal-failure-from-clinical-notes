The patient is a 65-year-old male who is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. He has been on medications for these conditions for the past five years. His blood pressure is generally well controlled, with readings consistently below 130/80 mmHg. His most recent LDL cholesterol level was 110 mg/dL, which is within the target range. However, his HbA1c level was 8.2%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control.

In addition to these chronic conditions, the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease stage 3, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 mL/min/1.73m2. He has been followed by a nephrologist for the past two years and is currently not on dialysis. His renal function has been stable during this time period, with only a slight decline in eGFR. He does not have any significant proteinuria or hematuria.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy in his early 40s and a cholecystectomy in his late 50s. Both procedures were uncomplicated, and he recovered well without any postoperative complications.

Medication-wise, the patient is taking lisinopril for his hypertension, atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia, and metformin and glimepiride for his diabetes. These medications have been effective in controlling his blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, respectively. He is compliant with his medication regimen and has not experienced any significant side effects.

The patient does not have any known drug allergies. He reports occasional cigarette smoking, with a history of smoking a pack per day for approximately 20 years. However, he quit smoking ten years ago and has not relapsed. He denies any use of recreational drugs or excessive alcohol consumption. He does not take any herbal supplements or over-the-counter medications regularly.

The patient's family history is notable for cardiovascular disease, with his father having a heart attack in his 50s. He has two brothers, one of whom has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are within the normal range. He is afebrile, with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His height is 6 feet, and he weighs 180 pounds, giving him a body mass index (BMI) of 24.4 kg/m2.

The patient appears to be in good overall health, with no visible signs of distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows a well-healed surgical scar from the previous cholecystectomy, but no palpable masses or tenderness. He does not have any lower extremity edema.

Laboratory tests that have been performed in preparation for surgery include a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function tests (LFTs), coagulation profile, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). The CBC reveals normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count. The BMP shows normal electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, as well as normal kidney function parameters, such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The LFTs are within the normal range, indicating normal liver function. The coagulation profile is also normal, ruling out any bleeding disorders. The ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.

Given the patient's stable medical conditions and preoperative optimization, he is considered a suitable candidate for surgery. The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia and is expected to take approximately two hours. The patient will be monitored closely throughout the procedure, and postoperative pain management will include a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

After surgery, the patient will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring and recovery. He will receive intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and adequate kidney perfusion. Routine postoperative laboratory tests, including electrolytes and renal function, will be ordered to monitor for any acute changes or complications.

Unfortunately, the patient develops acute renal failure in the days following surgery. This is characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function, with an increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in urine output. The patient's eGFR drops to 25 mL/min/1.73m2, indicating severe renal impairment.

The likely cause of the acute renal failure is multifactorial. Surgery itself puts stress on the kidneys due to hemodynamic changes, intraoperative hypotension, and exposure to nephrotoxic medications such as contrast agents. Additionally, the patient's preexisting chronic kidney disease and suboptimal glycemic control may have contributed to his vulnerability to acute kidney injury.

Treatment for the patient's acute renal failure includes aggressive fluid management to maintain adequate renal perfusion and diuresis. The patient will also receive medication to optimize blood pressure control and minimize further kidney damage. In severe cases, renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, may be required.

The patient's prognosis depends on the underlying cause and severity of the acute renal failure. With appropriate management, including timely intervention and close monitoring, the majority of cases can recover renal function to varying degrees. However, in some instances, the acute renal failure may progress to end-stage renal disease requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation.

In summary, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. He is planning to undergo surgery for a hernia repair. His chronic conditions are well managed with appropriate medications, although his glycemic control could be improved. The patient has a history of successful uncomplicated appendectomy and cholecystectomy. He does not have any significant drug allergies or tobacco misuse but has a family history of cardiovascular disease. Preoperative evaluations, including laboratory tests and physical examination, indicate that he is in good overall health and suitable for surgery. Unfortunately, the patient develops acute renal failure postoperatively, likely due to a combination of factors including surgical stress, preexisting kidney disease, and suboptimal glycemic control. Treatment involves aggressive fluid management and close monitoring, with the possible need for renal replacement therapy if renal function does not improve. Prognosis depends on the underlying cause and severity of the acute renal failure, with the possibility of recovery or progression to end-stage renal disease.
