The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.
He has had a previous myocardial infarction and a stent placement in his right coronary artery.
His blood pressure has been well-controlled on a combination of lisinopril and amlodipine.
He has been managing his diabetes with metformin and has good glycemic control.
The patient has been preparing for surgery due to an incidental finding of a suspicious pulmonary nodule on a routine chest X-ray.
He underwent a bronchoscopy which confirmed the presence of a lung mass, and subsequent biopsies revealed adenocarcinoma.
His primary care physician referred him to a thoracic surgeon for complete resection of the lung tumor.
The patient has been asymptomatic and has no systemic symptoms related to his lung cancer.
He has a good functional status and is motivated to undergo surgery to improve his chances of cure.
Preoperative tests were performed, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies, which were all within normal limits.

The patient has been admitted to the hospital the day before surgery for preoperative preparation.
He has been fasting and has received clear liquid diet instructions.
His blood pressure is stable and well-controlled on his regular antihypertensive medications.
His blood glucose levels have been closely monitored, and he is receiving an insulin sliding scale to maintain glycemic control.
The patient has been counseled on the surgical procedure and potential risks and benefits.
The thoracic surgeon discussed the possibility of postoperative complications, including bleeding, infection, and air leaks, and obtained informed consent.
The patient's surgical team includes an anesthesiologist, who will ensure he is safely put under anesthesia and monitor his vital signs during the procedure.
The anesthesiologist has reviewed the patient's medical history and is aware of his underlying conditions.

The patient underwent surgery, which involved a complete resection of the lung tumor.
The procedure was uneventful, and the patient tolerated it well.
Postoperatively, the patient was initially stable and did not experience any significant bleeding or complications.
He was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit and then transferred to a surgical recovery floor.
Routine postoperative care included patient-controlled analgesia for pain management and deep breathing exercises to prevent pneumonia.
On the second postoperative day, the patient developed acute renal failure, with a significant decrease in urine output and elevated creatinine levels.
His condition was likely secondary to intraoperative hypotension and possible nephrotoxic effects of anesthesia and other medications.
The patient's surgical team promptly consulted the nephrology service for further management.
The nephrologist recommended aggressive intravenous hydration to optimize renal perfusion and diuresis.
The patient's fluid balance was closely monitored, and he received intravenous diuretics to help improve his urine output.

Due to the acute renal failure, the patient's hospital stay was prolonged.
He required ongoing renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis to support his kidney function.
The nephrology team monitored his electrolyte levels and adjusted his medications accordingly.
The patient's cardiac medications were adjusted to account for his renal impairment.
He was closely monitored for signs of infection and received appropriate antibiotics as needed.
The patient's overall condition gradually improved, with an increase in urine output and a decrease in creatinine levels.
He was able to wean off of hemodialysis and transitioned to oral diuretics as his renal function recovered.
Throughout his hospitalization, the patient received multidisciplinary care, with regular follow-ups from the thoracic surgeon, nephrologist, and primary care physician.

Upon discharge, the patient was instructed to continue taking his antihypertensive and diabetic medications and to monitor his blood pressure and blood glucose levels at home.
He was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet.
The patient was scheduled for follow-up appointments with the thoracic surgeon and nephrologist to monitor his recovery.
His postoperative course was complicated by the acute renal failure, but with appropriate management, his kidney function gradually improved, and he was able to resume his usual activities.
The patient was also referred to an oncologist to discuss adjuvant therapy options for his lung cancer.
Overall, the patient's surgery was successful in removing the lung tumor, and his prognosis is favorable with continued follow-up and treatment.
