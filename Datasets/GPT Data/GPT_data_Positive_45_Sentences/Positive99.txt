The patient, a 50-year-old female, is planning to have surgery for an unspecified condition. Her medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. She has been managing her conditions with medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, and a statin for hyperlipidemia.

The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with her father having a heart attack at the age of 55. She also has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. She drinks alcohol occasionally but does not have a significant history of substance abuse.

On physical examination, the patient is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30. She has no significant abnormalities on cardiovascular examination, with regular heart sounds and no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Her lungs are clear on auscultation, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Laboratory investigations reveal well-controlled diabetes with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5%. Her lipid profile shows elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and slightly low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Her renal function tests are within the normal range, with a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 80 mL/min/1.73mÂ².

The patient's preoperative evaluation includes an electrocardiogram (ECG), which shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemic changes or arrhythmias. Her chest X-ray is unremarkable, and her pulmonary function tests reveal normal lung volumes and airflow.

To prepare for surgery, the patient is advised to continue her current medications, including the ACE inhibitor, metformin, and statin, up to the day of surgery. She is advised to hold her antihypertensive medication on the morning of surgery, and the decision regarding when to restart will be made by the anesthesiologist perioperatively.

During the surgery, the patient experiences a complication of acute renal failure. This is characterized by a rapid decline in renal function, leading to a significant increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in urine output. The patient develops oliguria, with a urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for several hours.

The acute renal failure is likely multifactorial in this patient, with the surgery, anesthesia, and underlying comorbidities playing a role. Other potential causes, such as intraoperative hypotension or the use of nephrotoxic medications, are also considered.

To manage the acute renal failure, the patient is closely monitored with hourly urine output measurements and serial laboratory investigations. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is initiated to maintain adequate hydration and optimize renal perfusion. Renal consult is obtained, and the patient is started on renal replacement therapy in the form of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to support her renal function.

The patient's other postoperative course is uneventful, with no signs of infection or wound complications. She is started on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection and is encouraged to ambulate early to prevent thromboembolic complications.

Daily monitoring of renal function is continued, with frequent adjustments of medications to ensure renal safety. The patient's urine output gradually improves, and her serum creatinine levels start to decrease.

After a few days, the patient's renal function stabilizes, and she no longer requires renal replacement therapy. Her urine output returns to normal, and her serum creatinine levels normalize. She is transitioned to oral medications, including her antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering agents.

The patient's postoperative follow-up includes regular visits to monitor her surgical recovery and to manage her chronic medical conditions. She is counseled on the importance of lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol intake.

In conclusion, this patient is planning to have surgery for an unspecified condition and has a significant past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. She is overweight and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. During the surgery, she develops acute renal failure, which is managed with close monitoring, renal replacement therapy, and adjustments of medications. Her postoperative course is otherwise uneventful, and she is transitioned to oral medications, with regular follow-up to manage her chronic conditions.
