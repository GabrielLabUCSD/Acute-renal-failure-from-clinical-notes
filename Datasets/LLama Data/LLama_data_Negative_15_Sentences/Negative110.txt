Regarding the patient's postoperative course, he will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for the first 24 hours after surgery due to his history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. He will be given appropriate pain management, including intravenous pain medication and a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The patient will also receive prophylactic antibiotics and will be monitored for signs of infection. He will be encouraged to move around and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent respiratory complications. The patient's blood pressure will be closely monitored and controlled with medication as needed.

The patient did not experience any complications during his postoperative course.

His blood pressure remained controlled throughout his hospital stay, and he was discharged home on postoperative day three with instructions to continue his medications and follow up with his surgeon and primary care physician.
