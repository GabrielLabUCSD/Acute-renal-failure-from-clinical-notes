Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and numbness in his lower extremities. He has been diagnosed with spinal stenosis and has tried conservative management without significant relief. He is now planning to undergo a lumbar decompression surgery.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication. He is also a former smoker and has a history of mild alcohol use. He denies any recent weight loss or fever.

On physical examination, the patient has decreased sensation in his lower extremities and decreased muscle strength in his feet. His reflexes are diminished and there is evidence of aposematic reflex.

The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count and electrolyte panel. His creatinine kinase level is mildly elevated.

The patient's imaging studies show severe spinal stenosis with compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots. There is also evidence of a herniated disc.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He has no known allergies to medication and is not taking any anti-coagulative medication.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to be uneventful. He will require close monitoring of his blood pressure and sugar levels during his hospital stay.

The patient is at risk for developing urinary retention and will require foley catheter placement for the first 24 hours after surgery.

The patient is expected to stay in the hospital for 3-5 days after surgery and will require assistance with activities of daily living during his recovery.

The patient will require pain management with narcotic medication and will be started on a bowel regimen to minimize the risk of constipation.

The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and will be started on subcutaneous heparin and compression stockings to minimize this risk.

The patient's prognosis is generally good, with a high likelihood of improvement in his symptoms after surgery.

However, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of complications such as infection, bleeding, or neurological deterioration.
