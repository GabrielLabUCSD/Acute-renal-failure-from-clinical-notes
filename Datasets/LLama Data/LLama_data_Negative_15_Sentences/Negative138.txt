Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, without significant relief. He is planning to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery.

The patient"s medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication. He had a myocardial infarction six years ago and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and uses an inhaler as needed.

The patient is a current smoker and has a history of alcohol abuse, but he reports that he has not consumed alcohol in the past year. He works as a construction worker and is eager to return to work as soon as possible after surgery.

Preoperative laboratory tests reveal an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, which are concerning for a possible infection. The patient"s blood type is A+, and he has a negative blood cross-match.

The patient undergoes a successful lumbar fusion surgery, with instrumentation and bone grafting. His postoperative course is complicated by a prolonged ileus, which resolves with conservative management. He also experiences some postoperative nausea and vomiting, which are treated with antiemetics.

The patient"s pain is well-controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia pump, and he is able to ambulate independently within 48 hours of surgery. He is discharged home on postoperative day 5 with a prescription for pain medication and instructions to continue his preoperative medications.

Follow-up appointments are scheduled for one week and six weeks postoperatively to assess his progress and remove sutures. The patient is advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting for six months after surgery.

Complications:
- Prolonged ileus
- Postoperative nausea and vomiting
