The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not found significant relief. The patient has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. The patient also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication.

The patient underwent a lumbar decompression surgery 3 months ago, which resulted in significant improvement in their lower back pain and radiculopathy symptoms. However, the patient recently experienced a sudden onset of worsening lower back pain and weakness in their left leg.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and was found to have a postoperative hematoma that required surgical intervention. The patient underwent a repeat lumbar decompression surgery, and the hematoma was evacuated.

The patient had a complicated postoperative course, experiencing respiratory failure and needing mechanical ventilation for 2 days. The patient also developed a urinary tract infection that was treated with antibiotics.

The patient remained in the hospital for 1 week for close monitoring and recuperation. The patient experienced some pain and discomfort but was managed with pain medication and physical therapy.

The patient was discharged home with a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. At the follow-up appointment, the patient reported significant improvement in their symptoms and was able to ambulate independently without assistance.

The patient was advised to continue with physical therapy and pain management, and to follow up with their primary care physician for ongoing management of their medical conditions.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgical outcome, but the postoperative course was complicated by respiratory failure and a urinary tract infection. The patient has since made a full recovery and is able to ambulate independently.
