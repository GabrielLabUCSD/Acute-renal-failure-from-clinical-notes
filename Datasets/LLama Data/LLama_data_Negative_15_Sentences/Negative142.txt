Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day. The patient has no known allergies and denies any recent illnesses. His surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair.

The patient's current medications include atorvastatin, metoprolol, and oxycodone. He has been ordered to stop taking aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for one week before surgery.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a lumbar decompression surgery. The procedure will involve removing a disk and fusing two vertebrae together. The surgeon has recommended that the patient undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood work, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest X-ray, to ensure that he is healthy enough for the surgery.

The patient is concerned about the potential risks and complications associated with the surgery, such as nerve damage, infection, and blood clots. The surgeon has reassured him that these risks are low and that the surgery will be performed using proper surgical techniques and prophylactic measures.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to involve several days of hospitalization for observation and pain management. He will be advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for several weeks after the surgery. He will also be prescribed pain medication and physical therapy to aid in his recovery.

The patient has been informed that there is a small risk of recurrent symptoms or continued pain after the surgery. However, the surgeon has stated that the surgery should significantly improve his quality of life and reduce his pain. The patient has been encouraged to follow up regularly with his surgeon to monitor his progress and address any concerns.
