Sure, here's a patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and limited mobility. He has been smoking for the past 20 years and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and pain management, without significant relief. He has a history of lumbar degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis, and an MRI revealed a large herniated disc at L4-L5. The patient's neurological examination is normal, except for decreased sensation in the L4-L5 dermatomal region. His past surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He takes aspirin, simvastatin, and lisinopril, and has no known allergies. He has a long history of substance abuse and has been sober for the past 5 years.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the third day after surgery. He experienced some mild discomfort and pain in the wound site, which was managed with pain medication. He was advised to follow a gentle exercise program to improve his mobility and strength. However, he developed a wound infection on the tenth postoperative day, which was treated with antibiotics. He also experienced some urinary retention, which resolved with catheterization. The patient's back pain improved significantly after surgery, and he was able to ambulate without assistance. He was followed up in the clinic after 6 weeks, and his wound was healing well.
