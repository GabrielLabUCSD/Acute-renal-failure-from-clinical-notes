Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without much relief. He is currently smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has a history of alcohol abuse. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication. He denies any cardiac or respiratory issues.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 6 months ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed to resolve his pain. He has been experiencing worsening pain in the left lower extremity, numbness in the left foot, and difficulty walking. He has been using a cane for assistance.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. His back examination reveals tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, and he has decreased sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes. His neurological examination shows bilateral decreased reflexes in the knees and ankles.

The patient's imaging studies show significant spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and spondylolisthesis. He is scheduled for a revision fusion surgery.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He experienced some pain, which was managed adequately with pain medication. He was able to ambulate independently on the second postoperative day and showed significant improvement in his neurological symptoms. He was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any major complications during his hospital stay. However, he did develop a mild case of postoperative nausea and vomiting, which responded well to antiemetics. He also had a mild wound infection, which was treated with antibiotics.
