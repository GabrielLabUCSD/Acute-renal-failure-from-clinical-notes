Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has been smoking for the past 20 years and has a history of hypertension. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, without significant relief. He is now considering surgical intervention, likely a lumbar fusion, to address his chronic pain.

Preoperative Studies:

The patient has undergone extensive preoperative testing, including an MRI of the lumbar spine, which showed significant degenerative changes and spinal stenosis. His blood work revealed mild anemia and elevated liver enzymes, likely related to his history of alcohol consumption. A preoperative ECG showed sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia.

Operative Course:

The patient underwent a successful lumbar fusion with instrumentation. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated it well. His postoperative course was somewhat complicated, however, due to a prolonged ileus, which resolved with supportive care and a nasojejunal tube.

Postoperative Complications:

The patient developed a wound infection at the incision site, which was treated with antibiotics and local wound care. He also experienced some postoperative nausea and vomiting, which were managed with antiemetics.

Follow-up:

The patient followed up with his surgeon and primary care physician regularly. He reported significant improvement in his back pain and was able to gradually wean off pain medication. He was advised to continue with physical therapy to improve his strength and mobility.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this patient had a successful lumbar fusion with instrumentation. His postoperative course was somewhat complicated, but he responded well to supportive care and medication. He experienced significant improvement in his back pain and was able to gradually wean off pain medication. This patient summary highlights the importance of preoperative planning, close monitoring during the postoperative period, and the need for continued follow-up to ensure optimal outcomes for patients undergoing surgical interventions.
