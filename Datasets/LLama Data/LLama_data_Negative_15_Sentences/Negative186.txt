Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for elective surgery. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has had a previous myocardial infarction and subsequently underwent a coronary artery bypass graft. He also has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and sleep apnea. The patient is allergic to penicillin and sulfa medications. He is currently taking aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin.

On the day of surgery, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. He reports some anxiety but is otherwise feeling well. The surgical procedure is performed without any complications, and the patient is transferred to the postanesthesia care unit for recovery.

The patient's postoperative course is uneventful. He experiences some nausea and vomiting, which is managed with antiemetics. He is given aspirin and lisinopril for pain management and hypertension prophylaxis. The patient is also administered oxygen therapy and encouraged to ambulate early to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
