The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for elective surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago and has been compliant with medications and lifestyle modifications since then. He has no history of bleeding disorders or previous surgeries. His current medications include atenolol, lisinopril, and simvastatin. He is allergic to penicillin and has a history of mild reactions to sulfa antibiotics.

Intraoperatively, the patient had a pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitor. He received general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and maintained stable vital signs throughout the procedure. He had a surgical drain inserted and received a total of 1000 mL of lactated Ringer's solution intraoperatively.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and extubated awake and alert. He had a stable blood pressure and oxygen saturation. He received acetaminophen and tramadol for pain management. He had a smooth postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day.

There were no complications during the postoperative period, and the patient had an uneventful recovery. He had follow-up appointments with his surgeon and primary care physician and was doing well at six weeks postoperatively.
