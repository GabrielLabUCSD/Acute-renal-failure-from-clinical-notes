The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication. He has no known allergies and has had no previous surgeries.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 6 months ago, which did not provide adequate pain relief. Postoperatively, the patient developed a wound infection that was treated with antibiotics.

The patient was subsequently referred to our institution for further management. On presentation, the patient had limited mobility and was using a cane for ambulation. His pain was scored at 8/10.

Physical examination revealed decreased mental health, tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, and decreased sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes. The patient"s neurological examination was otherwise normal.

Imaging studies, including an MRI, showed evidence of pseudarthrosis at the lumbar fusion site. The patient was scheduled for a revision lumbar fusion surgery.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and his pain improved significantly within the first few days. He was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with a pain score of 2/10.

Follow-up appointments showed continued improvement in the patient"s pain and mobility. He was able to walk independently and had returned to his normal activities.

However, at the 6-month follow-up appointment, the patient reported a sudden onset of severe back pain and inability to ambulate. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine and a positive Fallot"s sign.

Imaging studies showed evidence of a pseudarthrosis at the revision fusion site. The patient was diagnosed with a delayed postoperative complication of pseudarthrosis.

The patient underwent a second revision lumbar fusion surgery, which was successful in achieving a solid fusion. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 7 with a pain score of 3/10.

In conclusion, this patient had a complex medical history and required multiple surgical interventions to achieve adequate pain relief and successful fusion. Careful postoperative management and close follow-up were critical in identifying and treating delayed postoperative complications. The patient was able to achieve significant improvement in his quality of life and return to his normal activities without any ongoing issues.
