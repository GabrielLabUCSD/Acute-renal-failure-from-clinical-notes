Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has been diagnosed with spondylolisthesis and lumbar degenerative disc disease. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. He is now seeking surgical intervention to alleviate his symptoms.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication. He is a former smoker and denies alcohol or illicit drug use. The patient has no known allergies and his family history is unremarkable.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, which was complicated by a wound infection that required antibiotics and delayed his return to work. He has since made a full recovery and is currently working full-time.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no respiratory or cardiac complications. He did experience some nausea and vomiting in the immediate postoperative period, which was managed with antiemetics.

The patient's pain was well-controlled with opioid medication in the immediate postoperative period, but he did experience some withdrawal symptoms when the medication was tapered.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day five and has since returned to his normal activities, including driving and working.

The patient has been compliant with his follow-up appointments and has not experienced any significant complications since his surgery.

The patient's most recent MRI showed no evidence of recurrent disc herniation or nerve root compression.

The patient's current medications include Gabapentin and NSAIDs for pain management, as well as Lisinopril for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

The patient is planning to undergo a second surgery to address ongoing back pain and radiculopathy. This surgery will involve a multilevel fusion of the lumbar spine.

The patient understands the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for nerve damage, infection, and blood clots. He has also been informed of the potential need for further surgery if the symptoms persist.

The patient is eager to proceed with the surgery in hopes of alleviating his symptoms and improving his quality of life.
