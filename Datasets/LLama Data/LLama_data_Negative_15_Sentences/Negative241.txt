Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and decreased mobility. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is a current smoker. He denies any previous surgeries or significant medical history.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery with instrumentation. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient had an uneventful intraoperative course. He was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery, where he remained stable and without any complications.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a delayed recovery from anesthesia. He experienced prolonged somnolence and was slow to awaken, requiring observation in the PACU for several hours. He also reported mild nausea and vomiting, which responded well to antiemetic medication. The patient's pain was managed effectively with medication and was gradually weaned off pain medication over the next few days.

The patient's wound healing was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital within a week of the surgery. He was advised to follow a postsurgical rehabilitation program to regain strength and mobility in his back. He complained of mild numbness and tingling in his lower extremities, which gradually resolved over time.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and did not experience any other complications. He was seen in the clinic for follow-up appointments and reported improved pain and mobility. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and did not have any further complaints or complications.
