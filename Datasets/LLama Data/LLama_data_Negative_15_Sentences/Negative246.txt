Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, without significant relief. The patient is a candidate for lumbar fusion surgery to alleviate his symptoms.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will need to be controlled perioperatively. He is currently taking aspirin and metformin, and his blood work reveals normal liver and kidney function.

The patient is a nonsmoker and drinks occasionally. He has no known allergies and has not had any previous surgeries. The patient is in good overall health and does not have any respiratory or cardiac comorbidities.

The patient's surgical plan includes a lumbar fusion with instrumentation. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia, and the patient will be monitored closely for any signs of neurological compromise.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to be uneventful, and he will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours. He will receive routine postoperative medications, including pain medication, antihypertensives, and antibiotics.

The patient will be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible postoperatively and will be discharged home once he is able to do so safely. He will follow up with his surgeon in one week for suture removal and to assess his progress.

The patient is at low risk for complications, but potential risks include wound infection, nerve damage, and blood clots. The patient has been counseled on the risks and benefits of the procedure and has provided informed consent.

The patient's prognosis is good, and he is expected to experience significant improvement in his back pain and quality of life after surgery.
