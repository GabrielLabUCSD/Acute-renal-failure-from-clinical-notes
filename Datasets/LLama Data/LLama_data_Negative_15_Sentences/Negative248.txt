Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He is a former smoker and denies any significant medical history.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery two years ago, which provided some improvement in his symptoms. However, his pain has persisted and worsened over time, with a recent increase in left leg weakness. The patient's neurological exam shows decreased sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes and weakness in the left tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus muscles.

The patient's postoperative course has been complicated by a prolonged ileus, which required a seven-day stay in the intensive care unit for close monitoring. He developed a wound infection that was treated with antibiotics, and he required blood transfusions for anemia. otherwise, his recuperation was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 12.

Following discharge, the patient underwent physical therapy and gradually regained strength and mobility. He continued to experience some pain, but it was much reduced compared to his preoperative symptoms. He resumed his normal activities, including work and recreational pursuits, without any significant limitations.

Recently, the patient has noticed increased pain and weakness in his left leg, which has limited his mobility and forced him to seek further medical attention. Imaging studies have revealed a recurrent disc herniation at the same level as the previous fusion, which is likely contributing to his symptoms.

The patient is now scheduled for a repeat lumbar fusion surgery, and he will require a longer postoperative recovery period due to the complexity of the procedure and his previous complications. His postoperative care will include aggressive pain management, early mobilization and physical therapy, and close monitoring for any signs of complications.

In conclusion, this patient's medical history and postoperative course have been complicated by a number of factors, including a prolonged ileus, wound infection, and recurrent disc herniation. Despite these challenges, the patient has shown resilience and determination in his recovery and is eager to undergo the necessary surgical intervention to address his ongoing symptoms.
