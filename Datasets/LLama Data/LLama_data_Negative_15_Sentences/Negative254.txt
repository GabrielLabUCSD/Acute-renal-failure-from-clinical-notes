Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He has a history of alcohol use but denies any recent use. He presents with chronic low back pain and numbness in his legs, which has been gradually worsening over the past year. He has tried physical therapy and medication without significant relief. He is currently taking aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery three days ago. The surgery went smoothly, and he was extubated immediately after the procedure. He experienced some postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was managed with medication. He had a urinary catheter placed during surgery, which was removed the following day.

On the first postoperative day, the patient had a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C) and complained of worsening back pain. His white blood cell count was elevated at 12,000 cells/mm3. He was administered IV antibiotics and his pain was managed with narcotics.

On the second postoperative day, the patient's fever persisted, and he developed tachycardia and tachypnea. A chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe pneumonia. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his respiratory status improved over the next 24 hours.

On the third postoperative day, the patient's fever had resolved, and his white blood cell count had decreased to 8,000 cells/mm3. He was able to tolerate oral medications and his pain was managed with a combination of oral narcotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed a mild bilateral pedal edema. He was evaluated by a nephrologist and started on furosemide for mild nephrotoxicity. His urine output and electrolyte levels were closely monitored.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient's bilateral pedal edema had resolved, and his urine output and electrolyte levels had stabilized. He was able to ambulate independently and was discharged home with a follow-up appointment in one week.
