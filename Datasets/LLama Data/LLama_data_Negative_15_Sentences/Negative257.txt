Sure, here's a sample patient summary for a patient who is planning to have surgery:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. He has a history of lumbar disc herniation and has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. He is a candidate for lumbar fusion surgery.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication. He is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has no allergies to medications and has not had any previous surgeries.

The patient's physical examination reveals limited mobility in the lumbar spine and positive findings on bilateral extremities. His neurological examination is normal.

Preoperative laboratory tests, including complete blood count and electrolyte panel, are within normal limits. The patient's electrocardiogram shows no abnormalities.

The patient underwent lumbar fusion surgery without any complications. He tolerated the procedure well and had minimal postoperative pain.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was able to return to his normal activities within 6 weeks. He did not experience any complications during his recovery.

At 6-month follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his back and leg pain. He was able to walk longer distances and had improved mobility in his lumbar spine.

However, at 12-month follow-up, the patient reported some recurrence of his back pain, although it was not as severe as it was before the surgery. He was advised to continue with physical therapy and considered for further evaluation for potential hardware failure.

The patient's overall outcome was good, despite some recurrence of his symptoms. He was able to return to his normal activities and had improved mobility, although he did require further management for his recurrent symptoms.
