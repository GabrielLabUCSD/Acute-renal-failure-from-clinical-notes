Regarding the patient's postoperative course, it is anticipated that he will require at least 24 hours of postoperative care in the hospital. He is expected to experience some discomfort and pain, which will be managed with medication. The patient will be encouraged to mobilize early and participate in deep breathing exercises to reduce the risk of respiratory complications. He will also be monitored for signs of urinary retention or other surgical complications.

The patient's potential complications include wound infection, bleeding, seroma, or hematoma. In addition, there is a risk of nerve damage or recurrent radiculopathy if the nerve roots are not properly decompressed during surgery. However, these risks will be minimized with careful surgical technique and appropriate postoperative care.
