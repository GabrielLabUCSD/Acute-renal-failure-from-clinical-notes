2. He has a history of smoking and hypertension.
3. He has tried various conservative measures, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief.
4. The patient has been diagnosed with spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease.
5. He is scheduled to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery.
6. The patient is currently taking aspirin and atorvastatin for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
7. He has no known allergies to medications.
8. The patient has a history of occasional alcohol use but denies any recent alcohol consumption.
9. He is a retired construction worker and has a history of heavy lifting and bending.

2. He will be transferred to the ward once he is stable and alert.
3. The patient will receive pain management with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and will be encouraged to move around as soon as possible.
4. He will have a urinary catheter inserted to monitor urine output and minimize the risk of urinary retention.
5. The patient will receive prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
6. He will be encouraged to participate in deep breathing exercises and coughing to prevent respiratory complications.
7. The patient will have regular blood tests to monitor blood counts, liver and kidney function, and electrolytes.
8. He will be advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities for at least 6 weeks after surgery.
9. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after surgery to monitor wound healing and assess for any complications.

Here are potential complications that may arise:

1. Wound infection: The patient may develop a wound infection, which can be treated with antibiotics.
