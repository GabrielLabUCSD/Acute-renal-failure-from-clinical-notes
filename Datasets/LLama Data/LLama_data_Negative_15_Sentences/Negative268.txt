Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and decreased mobility. He has tried multiple conservative treatments, including physical therapy and pain medication, but has not experienced sufficient relief. The patient is a candidate for spinal fusion surgery to address his chronic back pain.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will need to be controlled perioperatively. He is currently smoking and will need to quit smoking before surgery. The patient has a BMI of 32, which increases his risk for complications.

Preoperative lab work shows a mild anemia and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of aspirin and Plavix use, which will need to be held before surgery. He is allergic to penicillin and has a history of mild reactions to IV contrast.

The patient underwent a successful spinal fusion surgery. Postoperatively, he experienced some expected discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. He was managed with IV pain medication and antiemetics.

On postoperative day 2, the patient developed a fever of 100.4Â°F. Blood cultures were drawn and antibiotics were started for suspected surgical site infection. The patient"s fever resolved, and he was afebrile by postoperative day 4.

The patient had a difficult time weaning off of pain medication and developed withdrawal symptoms. He was managed with a weaning schedule and supportive care.

On postoperative day 7, the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and developed a severe headache. He was given IV fluids and medication for migraine prophylaxis.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 8 with a prescription for pain medication and instructions for wound care.

At the 2-week follow-up appointment, the patient"s incision site was noted to be healing well, and he reported a significant decrease in back pain.

At the 6-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported a mild decrease in sensation in his feet, which was believed to be related to nerve damage from the surgery. He was referred to physical therapy for further rehabilitation.

The patient"s postoperative course was complicated by a surgical site infection, withdrawal symptoms, and a migraine. However, he ultimately had a successful outcome and is currently doing well.
