Here is a patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and sciatica. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not experienced significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he smokes a pack of cigarettes per day. His family history is positive for cardiovascular disease, and he has a history of sleep apnea. The patient has a BMI of 32, which increases his risk for complications during surgery. He has no allergies to medications and has never had a previous surgical procedure. The patient's blood work reveals elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate a history of alcohol abuse. He denies any recent travel or exposure to illness. The patient's surgical plan includes a lumbar fusion, which carries risks such as infection, nerve damage, and blood clots. He will need to take prophylactic antibiotics and blood thinners to minimize these risks. Postoperatively, the patient will require close monitoring in the ICU for the first 24 hours. He will also need to participate in a rehabilitation program to regain strength and mobility in his back. The patient is at risk for postoperative complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. He must be closely monitored and receive prompt treatment if any of these complications arise.
