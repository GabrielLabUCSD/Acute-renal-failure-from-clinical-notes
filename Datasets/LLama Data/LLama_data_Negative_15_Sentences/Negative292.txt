Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral knee pain. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and pain management, without significant relief. He is currently taking hydrocodone for pain control. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication. He is a non-smoker and denies any significant allergies.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed to fully address the pain. Therefore, he is now considering a total knee replacement surgery. The patient is currently taking anticoagulation medication, and his INR is within the therapeutic range. He denies any recent illnesses or hospitalizations.

The patient will need to discontinue the anticoagulation medication preoperatively, and we will closely monitor his INR levels to ensure safety during the surgery. We will also perform a thorough risk assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and take appropriate measures to prevent it. The patient will receive appropriate anesthesia and postoperative pain management.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had an uneventful surgery and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. He experienced some discomfort and pain in the knee, which was managed with pain medication. He was able to ambulate with assistance and had stable vital signs.

The patient was transferred to the surgical ward for further recovery and was monitored closely for any complications. He had a smooth postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital within three days.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any significant complications during his postoperative course. He had some mild nausea and vomiting on the first postoperative day, which were managed with antiemetics. He also experienced some mild knee swelling, which subsided with elevation and compression. The patient did not experience any wound infections, hematoma, or other complications during his postoperative course.

In conclusion, the patient had a successful total knee replacement surgery and an uneventful postoperative course. We closely monitored his blood work, medications, and overall health to ensure a safe and successful surgery. Despite some mild discomfort and nausea, the patient was discharged from the hospital within three days and is expected to make a full recovery.
