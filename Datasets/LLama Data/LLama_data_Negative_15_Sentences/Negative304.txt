Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is currently smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day. He denies any previous surgeries or significant medical history.

The patient underwent a lumbar decompression surgery 2 days ago. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and took approximately 2 hours to complete. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had an uneventful postoperative course. He was extubated immediately after surgery and remained in the recovery room for 2 hours before being transferred to the surgical floor.

During the postoperative period, the patient experienced mild discomfort, which was managed with pain medication. He was able to ambulate independently and had no difficulty with voiding or passing flatus. The patient was started on a proton pump inhibitor to prevent stress ulcers.

On the first postoperative day, the patient developed a mild cough and occasional nasal congestion, which was treated with over-the-counter medication. His respiratory status remained stable, and he was not tachypneic or hypoxemic. The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or straining for the next 6 weeks to allow proper healing of the surgical site.

On the second postoperative day, the patient developed a fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C) and reported feeling unwell. Blood cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected surgical site infection. The fever resolved within 24 hours, and the blood cultures returned negative. The patient completed a 7-day course of antibiotics without any further complications.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4, tolerating a soft diet and able to ambulate independently. At the time of discharge, he was prescribed pain medication, a proton pump inhibitor, and a muscle relaxant. Follow-up appointments were arranged for 2 weeks and 6 weeks post-discharge to monitor the patient's progress and remove sutures.

Throughout the postoperative period, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and he did not experience any cardiovascular or respiratory complications. He was advised to avoid smoking for at least 6 weeks after surgery to minimize the risk of wound complications and promote optimal healing. The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician for ongoing management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Overall, the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course, with successful management of mild complications. He was discharged from the hospital with appropriate medications and follow-up appointments arranged to ensure continued care and monitoring.
