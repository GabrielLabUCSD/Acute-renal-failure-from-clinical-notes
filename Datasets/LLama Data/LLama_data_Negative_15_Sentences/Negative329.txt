The patient has tried physical therapy and medication but has not experienced sufficient relief. He is scheduled for a lumbar decompression surgery.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and takes medication for these conditions. He has no history of bleeding disorders or previous surgeries.

The patient's surgery was performed under general anesthesia and took approximately three hours. The surgical procedure involved a lumbar decompression and fusion.

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the ICU for the first 24 hours. He experienced some nausea and vomiting but was managed with antiemetic medication.

The patient was then transferred to the surgical ward and continued to recover well. He was started on a pain management plan that included IV and oral medications.

On postoperative day two, the patient developed a fever and tachycardia. Blood cultures were drawn, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. The fever resolved within 24 hours, and the patient was afebrile for the remainder of his hospital stay.
