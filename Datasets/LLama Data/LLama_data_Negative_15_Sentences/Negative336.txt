The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented for a preoperative evaluation for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He has a history of gallstones and symptomatic cholecystitis for the past year. His past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

He underwent a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and his postoperative course was uneventful. He had some discomfort and nausea on the first postoperative day, but this resolved with analgesics and antiemetics. He was able to tolerate a regular diet on the second postoperative day and was discharged home on the third postoperative day.

He followed up with his surgeon one week after discharge and reported minimal discomfort and no complications. His incision sites were healing well, and he had no evidence of wound infection.
