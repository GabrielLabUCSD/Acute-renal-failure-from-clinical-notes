He has no known allergies and is not taking any medications. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication.

The patient experiences constant lower back pain, which radiates to his left leg, and numbness in his feet. He has difficulty walking long distances and experiences pain when standing or sitting for extended periods.

The patient did not develop any infections, seroma, or hematoma. He did not experience any change in neurological function or bowel or bladder dysfunction.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgical outcome and experienced significant pain relief. He was able to resume his normal activities, including working and exercising, without any limitations or complications.
