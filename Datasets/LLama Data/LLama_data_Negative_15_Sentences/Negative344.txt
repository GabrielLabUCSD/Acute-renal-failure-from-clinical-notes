Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and decreased mobility. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is currently taking medication for these conditions. He has no history of bleeding disorders or previous surgeries. The patient is a current smoker and has a history of alcohol use disorder, but he has been sober for the past year.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery three months ago. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day two. He experienced some pain and discomfort in the immediate postoperative period, but this was managed with pain medication. The patient followed the postoperative instructions and began physical therapy as recommended.

One week after surgery, the patient developed a wound infection, which was treated with antibiotics. He also experienced some nausea and vomiting, which resolved with antiemetics. The patient's pain began to improve over the next few weeks, and he was able to gradually wean off pain medication.

At his two-month follow-up appointment, the patient reported significant improvement in his back pain and mobility. He was able to walk without assistance and had resumed his normal activities. The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia were well-controlled, and he had quit smoking.

However, at his three-month follow-up appointment, the patient reported a recurrence of back pain and limited mobility. Imaging studies revealed a recurrent disc herniation at the same level as the previous surgery. The patient was referred to a pain management specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

Overall, the patient had a complicated postoperative course with a wound infection and recurrent disc herniation. However, he showed significant improvement in his pain and mobility with appropriate treatment and follow-up care. The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia were well-controlled, and he had made significant lifestyle changes, including quitting smoking.
