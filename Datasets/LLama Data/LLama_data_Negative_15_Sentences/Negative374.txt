Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He has a history of smoking and has been admitted to the hospital several times for chronic back pain. The patient has previously undergone a lumbar fusion surgery and has been managed with pain medication since. Recently, the patient has experienced increased left knee pain and has been advised to undergo a total knee replacement surgery.

Preoperative workup revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating probable infection or inflammation. The patient has been scheduled for a total knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia.

Postoperative course:

The patient had an uneventful surgery and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. He was closely monitored for vital signs and pain management. The patient was able to ambulate with assistance on the first postoperative day and was started on a rehabilitation program.

On the second postoperative day, the patient developed a fever of 101.5Â°F and tachycardia. Blood cultures were drawn, and empiric antibiotics were started for suspected infection. The fever and tachycardia resolved within 24 hours, and the patient continued to make progress with rehabilitation.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient reported increased pain in the knee and was found to have a large hematoma at the surgical site. The patient was taken back to the operating room for evacuation of the hematoma and was found to have a bleeding vessel that was ligated. The patient had a prolonged postoperative stay and required blood transfusions.

The patient was eventually discharged home on postoperative day 10 with a knee immobilizer and instructions for continued rehabilitation. He was advised to follow up with his surgeon in two weeks for a postoperative check-up.

Complications:

1. Prolonged postoperative stay due to bleeding complications.
2. Hematoma at the surgical site requiring surgical intervention.
3. Blood transfusions required.

The patient had a complicated postoperative course but ultimately made a full recovery and was able to ambulate independently without pain.
