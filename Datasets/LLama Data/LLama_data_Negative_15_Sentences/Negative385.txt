Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female who presents with a history of chronic back pain and limited mobility. She has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. She is scheduled to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to address her chronic pain and improve her quality of life.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication. She has no history of bleeding disorders or allergies to anesthesia. She is a non-smoker and has no history of substance abuse.

The patient's surgical history includes a previous cholecystectomy and hysterectomy, both of which were uneventful. She has no history of previous back surgeries.

The patient's family history is significant for osteoporosis and degenerative disc disease. Her mother and grandmother both required spinal fusions in their 50s.

The patient's current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and omeprazole. She has no allergies to medications.

The patient's review of systems is negative for fever, chills, or recent weight loss. She reports some nausea and vomiting in the days leading up to surgery, but this has been managed with antiemetics.

The patient's physical examination reveals limited mobility in the lumbar spine, with tenderness to palpation over the lower back. There is no evidence of neurological deficits or sensory loss.

The patient's preoperative lab work and imaging studies, including an MRI and CT scan, are within normal limits.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure will involve the use of instrumentation and bone grafting.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours. She will receive appropriate pain management and will be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible.

The patient will be at risk for postoperative complications, including wound infection, urinary retention, and respiratory compromise. She will be closely monitored for signs of these complications and will receive appropriate treatment as needed.

The patient will also be at risk for developing blood clots, given her history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She will receive appropriate prophylactic medication to minimize this risk.

The patient is expected to make a full recovery and will be able to return to her normal activities within several weeks after surgery.

There are no anticipated long-term complications or sequelae associated with this surgery.

The patient has been thoroughly counseled on the risks and benefits of the surgery, and has provided informed consent for the procedure.
