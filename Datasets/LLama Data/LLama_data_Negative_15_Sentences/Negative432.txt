Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and lumbar degenerative disc disease. He has been smoking for the past 20 years and has a history of hypertension. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not experienced sufficient relief. He is now seeking surgical intervention to alleviate his symptoms.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, which resulted in significant improvement in his pain levels. However, he recently experienced a fall that caused a displacement of the fusion, leading to renewed back pain and limited mobility.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a pulmonary embolism, which was treated with anticoagulation therapy. He also developed a wound infection that required antibiotics and delayed his return to normal activities.

Despite these complications, the patient has shown significant improvement in his condition and is now able to ambulate without assistance. He is still experiencing some discomfort but is manageing his pain effectively with medication.

The patient is advised to continue with his current treatment plan and to follow up with his surgeon regularly to monitor his progress. He is also encouraged to quit smoking and to adhere to a healthy lifestyle to minimize future complications.

I hope this summary helps you in planning the patient's surgery and postoperative care. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.
