Sure, here's a sample patient summary for a patient planning to have surgery:

"The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He has no known allergies and has never had a previous surgery. The patient's current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin. He was admitted to the hospital 2 days ago for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His preoperative lab results were within normal limits, except for a mildly elevated white blood cell count. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had a uneventful postoperative course. He experienced some mild discomfort and nausea, but it was well controlled with pain medication and antiemetics. The patient was able to eat solid foods within 24 hours and his output from the surgical drain was minimal. He was discharged on postoperative day 3 and followed up with his surgeon 1 week later. At that time, the surgical site was healing well and the patient had minimal discomfort. No complications were noted during the hospital stay or follow-up visit."
