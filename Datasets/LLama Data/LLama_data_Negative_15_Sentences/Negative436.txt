The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic low back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is a former smoker. He denies any significant surgical history.

Preoperative workup included an MRI of the lumbar spine, which showed a large L4-L5 disc herniation and mild spinal canal stenosis. The patient's surgical plan included a L4-L5 discectomy and decompression.

The patient had an uneventful intraoperative course and was extubated in the operating room. He was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for observation.

In the PACU, the patient had some nausea and vomiting, but this was controlled with antiemetics. He also developed some minor hypotension, which was treated with IV fluids.

The patient was transferred to the surgical ward after stabilization in the PACU. He was advised to rest and avoid heavy lifting or bending for the next few days.

Postoperatively, the patient reported significant improvement in his low back pain and radiculopathy. He was able to ambulate independently and had minimal discomfort.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 with a prescription for pain medication and instructions for further wound care.

Follow-up appointment was scheduled for 2 weeks after discharge. At this visit, the patient reported continued improvement in his symptoms and was able to return to work.

However, the patient did experience some mild urinary retention, which resolved spontaneously within a few days.

The patient's wound site healed uneventfully, and sutures were removed 2 weeks after discharge.

No other complications were reported or observed during the patient's postoperative course.

Overall, the patient had a successful outcome from his surgery and experienced significant improvement in his symptoms.
