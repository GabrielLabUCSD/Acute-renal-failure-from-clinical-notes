Regarding the patient's postoperative course, he is expected to spend 3-5 days in the hospital after surgery.

The patient will be advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for the first 6 weeks after surgery and will be referred to physical therapy for rehabilitation.

As for complications, the patient is at low risk for postoperative complications due to his otherwise healthy medical history. However, there is always a risk of bleeding, infection, or nerve damage with any surgical procedure.

The patient will be closely monitored for these potential complications and will be advised to report any concerning symptoms to his healthcare team.
