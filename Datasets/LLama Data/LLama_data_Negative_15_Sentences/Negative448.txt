Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic low back pain and sciatica. He has tried conservative management including physical therapy and medication without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and is currently taking medication for both conditions. He has no known allergies and has never had a surgical procedure before.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery, which was performed under general anesthesia. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient had a smooth postoperative course. He was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day.

On the fifth postoperative day, the patient developed a fever of 101.3°F (38.5°C) and reported increased pain at the surgical site. He was evaluated by his surgeon, who diagnosed a surgical site infection (SSI) and started him on antibiotics. The patient's fever resolved, and his pain improved with antibiotic treatment.

One week postoperatively, the patient developed a seroma at the surgical site. The seroma was small and did not require draining. The patient's wound healed without any further complications.

The patient's postoperative course was otherwise uneventful. He was seen in the clinic one month after surgery, and his wound was healing well. He reported still having some back pain, but it was significantly better than before surgery. The patient was advised to continue physical therapy to improve his back strength.

Overall, the patient had a successful outcome from his surgery, but did experience a surgical site infection and seroma. He required antibiotic treatment and had a slightly prolonged postoperative course, but his long-term outcome is expected to be good.
