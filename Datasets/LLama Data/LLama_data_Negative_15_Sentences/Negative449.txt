Patient Summary:

*Name: Jane Doe
*Age: 55
*Gender: Female
*Medical History: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*Medications: Lisinopril, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and aspirin
*Reason for Surgery: Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones
*Preoperative Exam: Unremarkable, except for a mildly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12,000 cells/mm3
*Operative Course: Uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy; estimated blood loss 200 mL
*Postoperative Course:
	+ Day 1: Patient experienced mild pain, nausea, and vomiting, which were managed with IV analgesics and antiemetics
	+ Day 2: Patient was afebrile, pain improved, and was able to take fluids and medications by mouth
	+ Day 3: Patient was discharged home in stable condition
*Complications: None
*Follow-up: Patient followed up with her surgeon 1 week postoperatively, and wound check was performed. Patient was doing well, and sutures were removed.

Note: The patient's WBC count may have been mildly elevated due to the gallstones causing inflammation in the biliary system, which is a common finding in patients with cholelithiasis. However, this is not a concern for the surgery and does not require further investigation.
