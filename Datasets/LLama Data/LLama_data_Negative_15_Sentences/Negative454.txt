Sure, here's a sample patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and numbness in his lower extremities. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. He has a history of smoking but has attempted to quit several times. He has no known allergies and is currently taking no medications. His family history is unremarkable. He works as a construction worker and denies any recent travel or sick contacts.

On examination, his vital signs are normal, and he has decreased sensation to light touch in his lower extremities. His straight leg raise is positive at 45 degrees. He has a mildly tender abdomen with no rebound tenderness or guarding. His remaining physical examination is unremarkable.

The patient has been scheduled for a lumbar fusion surgery. The procedure is expected to take 3-4 hours, and he will require a general anesthetic. He will be closely monitored for any signs of neurological compromise during the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient is expected to stay in the hospital for 3-5 days. He will be managed with pain medication and will be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible. He will require assistance with activities of daily living for the first few days after surgery.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and his pain has been well-controlled with medication. He experiences some nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours but recovers quickly. He ambulates successfully on the first postoperative day and is discharged home on the third postoperative day.

At three months follow-up, the patient reports significant improvement in his back pain and numbness. He has returned to work and is able to perform all his duties without any restrictions. He has not experienced any complications and has not required any further surgical interventions.
