There is mild tenderness to palpation over the lower back, and straight leg raise is positive at 45 degrees. Neurological examination reveals decreased sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes.

Imaging studies include an MRI of the lumbar spine, which shows a large central disc herniation at L4-L5, with severe spinal stenosis and nerve root compression.
