Sure, here's a sample patient summary for a patient who is planning to have surgery:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic low back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has been experiencing worsening pain over the past year, with difficulty ambulating and performing daily activities. The patient has a history of smoking and has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and is currently taking medication for these conditions. He has no known allergies to medications and has not had any previous surgeries.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 6 months ago, and has since experienced significant improvement in his pain and mobility. However, he has recently developed some recurrent back pain and has been referred for further evaluation.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no complications noted. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 and has since been recovering at home.

The patient has been adherent to his follow-up appointments and has reported gradual improvement in his symptoms over time. He has not experienced any new neurological symptoms or signs of infection.
