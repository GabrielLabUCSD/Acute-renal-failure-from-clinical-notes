Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for elective surgery. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. He denies any significant medical history, including cardiovascular disease or lung disease. He has an elevated body mass index (BMI) of 32 and has been advised to lose weight before surgery.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy at age 25 and a cholecystectomy at age 35, both of which were uneventful. He has no known allergies to medications and does not take any herbal supplements.

Preoperative examination reveals normal vital signs, except for mild hypertension. His electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram are normal. His blood work shows mild anemia and elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which are attributed to his history of heavy alcohol consumption.

The patient undergoes elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The surgery goes smoothly, and he is extubated in the operating room. He is transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

In the PACU, the patient experiences some nausea and vomiting, which are managed with antiemetics. He also develops mild respiratory distress, which is treated with supplemental oxygen. His pain is managed with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).

The patient is transferred to the surgical ward on the first postoperative day. He continues to experience mild respiratory distress and hyperpyrexia, which are managed with antibiotics and supportive care. His pain is well managed with PCA.

On the second postoperative day, the patient develops a wound infection, which is treated with antibiotics. He also experiences constipation, which is managed with laxatives.

The patient's postoperative course is prolonged, and he requires additional supportive care, including blood transfusions and iv fluids. He is eventually discharged on the seventh postoperative day, with a plan for follow-up wound care and pain management.

The patient experiences a smooth recovery at home and follows up with his surgeon and primary care physician. He does not develop any complications during the follow-up period.

In summary, this patient underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and experienced a prolonged postoperative course due to respiratory distress, hyperpyrexia, and wound infection. He required supportive care, including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and iv fluids, but did not experience acute renal failure. He had a smooth recovery at home and did not develop any complications during the follow-up period.
