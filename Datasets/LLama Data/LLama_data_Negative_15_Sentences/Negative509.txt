Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and sciatica. He has been experiencing worsening pain over the past year, which has been affecting his ability to ambulate and perform daily activities. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not found relief. He is currently taking hydrocodone for pain management.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication regularly. He is also a smoker and has a history of alcohol use disorder, for which he has received treatment in the past.

The patient underwent an L5-S1 lumbar fusion surgery six years ago, which provided some initial relief but ultimately did not solve the problem. He has since developed a pseudarthrosis at the fusion site.

The patient's current symptoms include persistent low back pain, radiating pain down the left leg, and numbness in the left foot. He also experiences muscle spasms and has difficulty ambulating due to the pain.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy, a hernia repair, and the aforementioned lumbar fusion surgery.

The patient's medication list includes hydrocodone, lisinopril, and simvastatin.

The patient is allergic to sulfa medications and has a history of an allergic reaction to morphine.

The patient's bloodwork shows an elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, indicating an inflammatory response.

The patient's imaging studies, including X-rays and an MRI, show evidence of the pseudarthrosis at the fusion site and degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.

Based on the patient's history and examination, the patient is a candidate for revision fusion surgery to address the pseudarthrosis.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home three days after surgery.

The patient followed up with his surgeon at the two-week mark and reported significant improvement in his pain and mobility.

At the six-week mark, the patient reported some increased pain and discomfort, which was managed with medication adjustments and physical therapy.

Overall, the patient has made a successful recovery and is back to his normal activities without any complications.

The patient's current medication list includes hydrocodone, lisinopril, and simvastatin.

The patient has been advised to continue with physical therapy and maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent future exacerbations.
