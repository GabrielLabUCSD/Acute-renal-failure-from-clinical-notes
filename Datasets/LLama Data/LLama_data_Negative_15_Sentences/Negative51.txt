Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a history of chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has a history of lumbar spine surgery 10 years ago and has been experiencing increasing pain and weakness in his left leg over the past year. He has tried physical therapy and pain management without significant relief. He is currently taking gabapentin and hydrocodone. He has no allergies and is in good overall health.

The patient underwent a lumbar spine fusion surgery. The surgery went well, and he was extubated in the operating room. He was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. He had a rough first night, experiencing nausea and vomiting, but this resolved with antiemetics. He had some pain in his upper abdomen, which was managed with non-opioid medication. His analgesia was optimized with a pain pump. He had a UTI, which was treated with antibiotics. He was transitioned to the floor on postoperative day 2 and had a smooth recovery after that.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged home on postoperative day 7 with a two-week supply of pain medication and instructions to gradually wean off. He had follow-up appointments with his surgeon and primary care physician. He reported minimal pain and was able to ambulate without assistance. His wound healed well, and he had no signs of infection. He is expected to make a full recovery and return to his normal activities.
