Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain. She has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. Her pain has been gradually worsening over the past year, and she reports difficulty ambulating and performing daily activities.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and she is currently taking medications for these conditions. She has no known allergies to medications and has never had an adverse reaction to anesthesia.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and a hysterectomy, both of which were uneventful. She has never had a surgical procedure on her spine or any other joint.

The patient's current surgical plan is for a lumbar decompression and fusion. Preoperative workup includes standard blood work, imaging studies, and a cardiology consultation, all of which were within normal limits.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with minimal pain and discomfort. She was able to ambulate independently and perform basic activities of daily living without assistance.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4, with instructions to continue her medications and follow up with her surgeon in 2 weeks. She did not experience any complications during her hospital stay or after discharge.

At her 2-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported improved pain and function, with minimal residual discomfort. She was able to walk without assistance and resume her normal activities.

The patient's wound healed without any issues, and there were no signs of infection or other complications at her 4-week follow-up appointment.

At her 6-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported continued improvement in pain and function, with near-complete resolution of her preoperative symptoms. She was able to perform all activities without assistance and had no limitations in her daily activities.

The patient's overall postoperative course was uneventful, with a smooth and rapid recovery. She did not experience any complications or adverse events during her hospital stay or after discharge.

Based on this information, the patient appears to be a suitable candidate for lumbar decompression and fusion surgery, with a low risk of complications. Her medical history, including her hypertension and hyperlipidemia, will need to be managed appropriately during her perioperative period to minimize any potential risks.
