Sure, here's a patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery:

1. The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy.
2. He has tried conservative management including physical therapy and medications without significant relief.
3. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication.
4. He has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago.
5. The patient has a BMI of 32 and has been counseled on the risks of obesity and surgery.
6. He has no allergies to medications or materials.
7. The patient has a history of non-cardiac surgery, including a cholecystectomy 10 years ago.
8. Preoperative lab work shows a normal complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests.
9. The patient's creatinine kinase level is mildly elevated at 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.
10. He has a positive history of ASA and codeine use without any adverse effects.
11. The patient is taking aspirin and lisinopril, which will be held preoperatively as per surgeon's instructions.
12. He denies any recent illness or injuries.
13. The patient has a normal preoperative ECG and echocardiogram.
14. He has a high-risk surgical stress test, which shows a high risk of postoperative complications.
15. The patient is scheduled for a minimally invasive spine surgery under general anesthesia.

Regarding the patient's postoperative course, he is expected to spend one night in the hospital for observations. He will be monitored closely for signs of respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting. Pain management will be provided through patient-controlled analgesia and/or epidural anesthesia. The patient will be encouraged to mobilize and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent respiratory complications.

As for complications, the patient is at high risk for developing postoperative nausea and vomiting due to the high-risk surgical stress test. Additionally, he is at risk for respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, due to his history of smoking and obesity. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of infection and wound complications. However, the patient is not at high risk for acute renal failure based on his preoperative lab work and medical history.
