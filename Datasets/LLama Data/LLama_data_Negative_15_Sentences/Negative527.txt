Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient is a candidate for lumbar fusion surgery to address his chronic pain and improve his quality of life.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will need to be controlled perioperatively to minimize risks. He is currently taking several medications, including atorvastatin, lisinopril, and omeprazole, and will need close monitoring of his medication regimen during his hospital stay.

The patient has a history of smoking, but quit 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally, but denies any illicit drug use. He works as a computer programmer and will need to take several weeks off work to recover from the surgery.

The patient underwent lumbar fusion surgery without any intraoperative complications. He was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery and closely monitored for any signs of respiratory or cardiovascular compromise.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced some nausea and vomiting, which were managed with antiemetics. He also developed some mild postoperative pain, which was controlled with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).

On the first postoperative day (POD1), the patient was able to ambulate and sit in a chair. He was encouraged to deep breathe and cough to help prevent respiratory complications.

On POD2, the patient was able to walk longer distances with minimal pain, and his wound dressing was changed. He was also started on a regime of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis to minimize the risk of venous thromboembolism.

On POD3, the patient was discharged home with a pain pump and instructions for wound care and activity restrictions. He was also prescribed oral analgesics and muscle relaxants for pain control.

During the postoperative period, the patient did not experience any complications related to the surgery. He was closely followed up in the outpatient setting with regular appointments to monitor his progress and manage any postoperative complications.

Overall, the patient tolerated the surgery well and experienced minimal postoperative complications. He is expected to make a full recovery and return to his normal activities within several weeks.
