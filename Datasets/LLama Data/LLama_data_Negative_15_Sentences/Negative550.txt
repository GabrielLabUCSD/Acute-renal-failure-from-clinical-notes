The patient's history of smoking and chronic lung disease increases the risk for respiratory complications. The patient's history of cancer increases the risk for developing blood clots. The patient's history of chronic lower back pain may increase the risk for postoperative backache.

Regular monitoring and management of these factors will be important for a smooth postoperative recovery.
