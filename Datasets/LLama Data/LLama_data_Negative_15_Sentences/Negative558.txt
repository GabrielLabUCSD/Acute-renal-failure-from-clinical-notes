Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient is a candidate for lumbar fusion surgery to address his chronic pain and improve his quality of life.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will need to be controlled perioperatively to minimize the risk of complications. He is currently taking aspirin and metformin, and his blood work shows normal liver and kidney function.

The patient is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has no known allergies and has not had any previous surgeries. His family history is unremarkable.

The patient's physical examination reveals limited mobility in his lower back and left leg, with positive signs of nerve root compression. His neurological examination is otherwise normal.

The patient's preoperative workup includes an MRI of the lumbar spine, which shows multilevel degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. His electrolytes and blood count are within normal limits.

The patient underwent lumbar fusion surgery without any intraoperative complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on the third day after surgery.

The patient followed up with his surgeon one week after discharge and reported mild postoperative pain, which was managed with oral medication. He was advised to continue his physical therapy and to gradually increase his activities.

At his six-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his back pain and was able to ambulate without assistance. His physical therapy was progressing well, and he was able to perform basic activities of daily living without difficulty.

However, at his three-month follow-up, the patient reported a new onset of left leg weakness and numbness. MRI revealed a recurrent disc herniation at the L4-L5 level. The patient underwent revision surgery, and his postoperative course was complicated by a prolonged hospital stay due to wound infection.

The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and made a full recovery. However, his postoperative recovery was prolonged, and he required additional physical therapy to regain his strength and mobility.

In conclusion, the patient's surgical course was complicated by a recurrent disc herniation and wound infection, which required additional surgical intervention and prolonged his postoperative recovery. However, the patient made a full recovery and was able to resume his normal activities without significant residual deficits.
