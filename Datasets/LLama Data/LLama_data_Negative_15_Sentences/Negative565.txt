Patient Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and decreased mobility. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and has been smoking for the past 20 years. He has no known allergies and has been compliant with his medication regimen.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 10 years ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed. He has since developed a pseudarthrosis at the fusion site and experiences persistent pain. The patient has also developed severe degenerative disc disease at multiple levels.

Preoperative workup revealed a mild anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The patient's blood work was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient was scheduled for a multilevel fusion surgery, including the previous fusion site. The surgery was successful, and the patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) without any complications.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced some nausea and vomiting, but this was well managed with medication. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 and began his rehabilitation program.

The patient had a moderate postoperative course, with some pain and discomfort, but was able to ambulate and perform activities of daily living without assistance. He was able to reduce his pain medication and was weaned off narcotics within 6 weeks.

The patient followed up with his surgeon at 6 weeks, and his incision site was well-healed with no signs of infection. He demonstrated improved mobility and reduced pain compared to his preoperative status.

The patient continued to improve over the next several months, with gradual resolution of his pain and improved mobility. He was able to return to his preoperative activities, including light exercise and hobbies.

There were no complications during the patient's postoperative course, including no signs of infection, nerve damage, or blood clots. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of his surgery and reported a significant improvement in his quality of life.
