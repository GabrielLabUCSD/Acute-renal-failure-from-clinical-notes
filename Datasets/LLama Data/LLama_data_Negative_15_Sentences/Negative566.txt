Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain. He has been diagnosed with spondylolisthesis and lumbar spinal stenosis. His pain has been managed with physical therapy, chiropractic care, and pain medication.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication. He has never smoked and consumes alcohol in moderation. He denies any allergies to medications or previous adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery several years ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed. He has since developed severe left leg weakness and numbness.

On examination, the patient walks with a cane and has difficulty standing on his left leg. His left lower extremity is weaker than his right. His sensation to light touch is decreased over the left L2-S1 dermatomes. His reflexes are brisk in both knees.

Preoperative workup includes an MRI of the lumbar spine, which shows a high-grade spondylolisthesis at L4-L5 with severe spinal canal stenosis and bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.

The patient underwent a successful L4-L5 decompression and fusion surgery, with resolution of his postoperative pain. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 without any complications.

Following discharge, the patient reported some mild, temporary numbness in his left foot, which resolved within a few days. He also experienced some mild postoperative nausea and vomiting, which were managed with medication.

The patient followed up with his surgeon one week after discharge and reported significant improvement in his pain and function. He was able to walk longer distances without the assistance of a cane.

The patient resumed his normal activities, including work and exercise, four weeks after surgery. He reported occasional mild back discomfort but denied any severe pain or weakness in his legs.

At his six-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported complete resolution of his preoperative pain and weakness. He was able to stand on his left leg without difficulty and had normal sensation to light touch over his left L2-S1 dermatomes.

The patient"s postoperative course was otherwise uneventful, and he experienced no further complications. His surgical wound healed properly, and he did not require any further interventions.

In summary, the patient underwent a successful L4-L5 decompression and fusion surgery with resolution of his postoperative pain and improvement in his functional status. He experienced a temporary and mild numbness in his left foot and some postoperative nausea and vomiting, but these resolved without any further complications. The patient was able to resume his normal activities and reported complete resolution of his preoperative symptoms at six weeks follow-up.
