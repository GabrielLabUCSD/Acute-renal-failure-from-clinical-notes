Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried conservative management including physical therapy and medication without significant relief. The patient is an ex-smoker and has a history of hypertension. He denies any recent weight loss, fever, or recent significant illness. The patient has a history of prior lumbar surgery ten years ago with a previous lumbar fusion. He has been advised by his current doctor that he requires a revision fusion surgery.

Postoperative Course:

Following successful surgery, the patient was closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit for several hours before being transferred to the surgical ward. He experienced some discomfort and pain, which was managed effectively with medication. The patient was encouraged to begin mobilizing and ambulating as soon as he was able, with the assistance of a physiotherapist. He was able to eat and drink normally and did not experience any nausea or vomiting.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any significant complications during his postoperative course, including acute renal failure. He did, however, develop mild respiratory failure on the first postoperative day, which was managed with non-invasive ventilation and appropriate medication. This resolved within 24 hours, and the patient's respiratory function improved. 

The patient also experienced mild postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was managed with antiemetics and did not persist. He did not have any signs of wound infection or bleeding. The patient's pain was managed effectively with medication, and he was able to ambulate independently within 48 hours of surgery. He was discharged from the hospital five days after surgery and will continue his rehabilitation as an outpatient.
