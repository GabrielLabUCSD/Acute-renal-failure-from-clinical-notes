Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has tried physical therapy and medication without significant relief. Imaging studies show a large L4-L5 disc herniation and spinal stenosis. The patient is a candidate for a lumbar decompression and fusion surgery.

Preoperative medications include ibuprofen and gabapentin. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will be controlled perioperatively.

Intraoperative course was uneventful. The patient received general anesthesia and was positioned prone for the procedure. There were no significant changes in vital signs during the case.

Postoperative course was complicated by a wound infection, which was treated with antibiotics. The patient also developed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which was managed with conservative measures. He was discharged home on postoperative day 7 with a negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) device in place.

Follow-up at 2 weeks showed a significant improvement in back pain and radiculopathy symptoms. However, the patient did report some continued numbness in the left foot. Wound healing was satisfactory, and the NPWT device was discontinued.

Follow-up at 6 weeks showed full resolution of numbness in the left foot and improved back pain symptoms. The patient was able to resume light activity and was advancing well with physical therapy.

Follow-up at 12 weeks showed sustained improvement in symptoms, and the patient was able to resume full activity without any restrictions.

The patient"s postoperative recovery was otherwise uneventful, without evidence of complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or cardiac events.

The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and reported improved quality of life at 6 months follow-up.

Conclusion:
In this patient summary, we have described a patient who underwent lumbar decompression and fusion surgery for chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. The patient had an uncomplicated intraoperative course but did experience a wound infection and CSF leak postoperatively. Despite these complications, the patient had a satisfactory outcome and reported improved symptoms and quality of life at follow-up.
