He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, without significant relief. He has a history of smoking, HTN, and hyperlipidemia. He has no known allergies and denies any previous surgeries or significant medical history.

Preoperative:
The patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, including lab work, imaging studies, and cardiac clearance. His blood work showed mild anemia and slight elevation in liver enzymes, but otherwise normal results. His imaging studies showed multilevel degenerative changes in the spine, with spinal stenosis and herniated discs. His cardiac clearance was obtained, and he was deemed a low risk for surgical intervention.

Intraoperative:
