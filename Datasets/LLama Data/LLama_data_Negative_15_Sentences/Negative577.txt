Patient Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative joint disease. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. He is a candidate for spinal fusion surgery.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. He is currently smoking and has a history of alcohol use disorder. He denies any recent significant weight loss or fever.

The patient has a history of prior surgical procedures, including a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He has no history of bleeding disorders or allergies to anesthesia.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are stable. His blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg, pulse is 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient's cardiovascular and respiratory systems are clear. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, without any evidence of surgical adhesions. His spine demonstrates limited flexion and extension, consistent with degenerative joint disease.

The patient's neurological examination reveals decreased sensation to light touch over the L4-S1 dermatomes. His muscle strength is 4/5 in the lower extremities. His reflexes are 2+ and his plantar response is flexor.

The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, including his complete blood count and electrolyte levels. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, but there is no evidence of acute renal failure.

The patient's imaging studies, including X-rays and an MRI, demonstrate severe degenerative joint disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1. The MRI also shows a mild central canal stenosis at L4-L5.

The patient's postoperative course is significant for a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit due to respiratory failure. He required invasive mechanical ventilation for 24 hours and was eventually weaned to a non-rebreather mask.

The patient developed a surgical site infection, which was treated with antibiotics. He also experienced significant postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was managed with antiemetics.

The patient's pain was well-controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia pump. He was transitioned to oral pain medication on postoperative day 3 and was discharged home on postoperative day 7.

At his one-month follow-up appointment, the patient reports significant improvement in his back pain and is able to ambulate without assistance. His neurological examination is consistent with his preoperative examination.

At his six-month follow-up appointment, the patient reports continued improvement in his back pain and is able to perform activities of daily living without significant difficulty. His neurological examination remains consistent.

The patient's lumbar spine X-rays at six months demonstrate evidence of successful fusion. The patient is satisfied with his surgical outcome and has been able to discontinue his pain medication.
