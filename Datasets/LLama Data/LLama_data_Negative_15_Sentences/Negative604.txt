Patient Summary: 

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, but has not found sufficient relief. He is planning to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to address his symptoms. 

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is currently taking medication to manage these conditions. He is also a smoker and has a history of mild obstructive sleep apnea. 

The patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, which included a physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The results showed that the patient has mild renal insufficiency and mild anemia, but no other significant medical issues. 

The patient underwent the planned lumbar fusion surgery without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day. 

After discharge, the patient had some pain and discomfort, but this was manageable with pain medication. He followed up with his surgeon regularly and had no issues with wound healing or infection. 

However, the patient did experience some numbness and weakness in his legs, which was expected due to the nerve compression caused by the degenerative disc disease. This gradually improved over time with physical therapy and nerve gliding exercises. 

Overall, the patient had a successful outcome from his surgery and was able to return to his normal activities, including work and recreational pursuits. He will continue to be monitored for any potential late complications or recurrence of his symptoms.
