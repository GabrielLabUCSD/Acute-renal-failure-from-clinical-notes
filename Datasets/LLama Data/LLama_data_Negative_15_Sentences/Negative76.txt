Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for surgery. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and has been compliant with medications since then. He has no history of bleeding disorders or previous surgeries. He is a nonsmoker and drinks minimally. He is allergic to penicillin. His physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. His respiratory and cardiovascular examinations are normal. His abdominal examination shows a tender gallbladder with guarding and rebound tenderness. His liver function tests are normal, and a cholecystectomy is planned.

Postoperative Course:
The patient had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and tolerated the procedure well. He had some postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was managed with antiemetics. He had minimal pain and was discharged home the following day. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and bending for 2 weeks. He experienced some mild urinary retention, which resolved with bladder training.

Complications:
The patient did not experience any major complications during his postoperative course. He did develop mild postoperative delirium on the first postoperative day, but this resolved with reorientation and medication optimization. He also developed a mild wound infection, which was treated with antibiotics. He did not require any surgical intervention for this complication. He has since fully recovered and is doing well at home.
