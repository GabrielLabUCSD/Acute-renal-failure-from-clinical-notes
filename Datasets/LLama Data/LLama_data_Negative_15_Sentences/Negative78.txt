Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and pain management, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is currently taking medication for these conditions. He is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, and his postoperative course was uneventful. He experienced some initial pain and discomfort, which was managed with pain medication. He followed the postoperative instructions and participated in physical therapy to regain strength and mobility.

However, the patient recently experienced increased pain and discomfort in his lower back, which radiates down to his left leg. He also reports numbness and tingling sensations in his left foot. Upon examination, there is decreased sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes.

Imaging studies revealed recurrent disc herniation at the L4-L5 level. The patient is scheduled for a repeat lumbar fusion surgery. His surgical history includes an appendectomy and a cholecystectomy, both of which were uneventful.

The patient has a supportive family and is motivated to follow the postoperative instructions to ensure a successful outcome. He is aware of the potential risks and complications associated with the surgery and has realistic expectations.

There are no acute medical conditions that would contraindicate surgery. However, we will monitor the patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels closely during the perioperative period, given his history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

We will also ensure that the patient receives appropriate postoperative pain management and follows a rehabilitation program to optimize his recovery.
