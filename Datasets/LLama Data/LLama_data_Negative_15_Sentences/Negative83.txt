Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and limited mobility. He has been smoking for 20 years and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. He is now considering surgery to address his back pain.

The patient has a history of previous surgical interventions, including a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He has no known allergies to medications or anesthesia. He is currently taking aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.

The patient"s physical examination reveals limited mobility in the lower back, with tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. His neurological examination is normal.

The patient"s MRI scan shows a large lumbar disc herniation, which is likely causing his pain. The patient"s blood work is within normal limits, with the exception of a mildly elevated white blood cell count.

We have planned a posterior lumbar fusion surgery to address the patient"s back pain. The surgery will involve fusion of the L4-L5 vertebrae, with instrumentation to stabilize the spine.

The patient understands the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential for infection, nerve damage, and blood clots. He has been counseled on the importance of postoperative rehabilitation to regain strength and mobility.

The patient will be admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery and will be closely monitored for any complications. He will receive prophylactic antibiotics and blood thinners to minimize the risk of infection and clots.

Postoperatively, the patient will be managed with pain medication and will be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible. He will be discharged home once he is able to walk independently and manage his pain effectively.

The patient will follow up with us at two weeks, six weeks, and twelve weeks postoperatively to assess his progress and remove any sutures or staples.

Overall, the patient is a good candidate for surgical intervention, and we expect a successful outcome with proper postoperative care and rehabilitation.
