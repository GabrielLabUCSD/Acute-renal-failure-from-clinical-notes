Note: The patient's medical history, medications, allergies, lab results, and postoperative course are all important factors to consider when planning surgery. While the patient has several medical conditions, they are well-controlled and do not pose a significant risk for surgery. The patient's obesity and history of smoking may increase the risk of postoperative complications, but they can be managed with careful monitoring and appropriate interventions. The patient's urinalysis indicates mild proteinuria and hematuria, but these are not significant concerns for surgery.
