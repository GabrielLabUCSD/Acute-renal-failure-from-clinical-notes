Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is a former smoker. He denies any recent significant weight loss or fever.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 10 years ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed. He has since developed a pseudarthrosis at the fusion site. The patient's current symptoms include persistent back pain, left leg weakness, and numbness in the foot and toes. He has difficulty ambulating and experiences pain with coughing, sneezing, and bending.

The patient's physical examination reveals a scar from the previous fusion surgery, tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, and decreased muscle strength in the left lower extremity. The patient's neurological examination demonstrates decreased sensation in the L4-S1 dermatomes and diminished reflexes in the left knee and ankle.

Imaging studies, including an MRI and CT myelogram, show evidence of pseudarthrosis at the previous fusion site, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis. There is also evidence of advanced spinal degeneration, including facet joint hypertrophy and osteophyte formation.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for the first 6 weeks after surgery. The patient was also prescribed pain medication and instructed to gradually wean himself off it over time.

Follow-up appointments with the surgeon were scheduled at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. At the 6-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms, including reduced back pain and improved ambulation. However, he continued to experience some numbness in the foot and toes. The surgeon recommended continued physical therapy and gradual return to activities.

At the 3-month follow-up, the patient reported further improvement in his symptoms and was able to ambulate without assistance. He still experienced some numbness in the foot and toes but was otherwise satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. The surgeon recommended continued physical therapy and gradual return to activities.

The patient experienced no complications during his postoperative course. He was advised to continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor his progress and address any concerns or issues that may arise.
