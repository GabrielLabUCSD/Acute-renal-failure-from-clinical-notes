Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is a former smoker. He denies any recent significant weight loss or fever.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 10 years ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed. He has since developed a pseudarthrosis at the fusion site. The patient's current symptoms include persistent back pain, left leg weakness, and numbness in the foot and toes. He has difficulty ambulating and experiences pain with coughing, sneezing, and bending.

The patient's physical examination reveals a scar from the previous fusion surgery, tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, and decreased muscle strength in the left lower extremity. His neurological examination shows decreased sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes.

Imaging studies, including X-rays and an MRI, confirm the presence of a pseudarthrosis at the fusion site and spinal stenosis. The patient's preoperative lab results are within normal limits, except for a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

The patient underwent a revision lumbar fusion surgery, which involved the removal of the previous fusion hardware and the insertion of a new implant. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced some expected discomfort, which was managed with pain medication. He was encouraged to ambulate early and was able to do so with assistance. The patient's wound healed uneventfully, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 4.

Following discharge, the patient experienced some mild nausea and vomiting, which resolved with antiemetics. He also developed some mild lower back pain, which was managed with medication. The patient's neurological symptoms improved, and he was able to ambulate without assistance at 6 weeks postoperative.

At 12 weeks postoperative, the patient reported a significant improvement in his symptoms, with minimal back pain and improved muscle strength in the left lower extremity. His neurological examination showed improved sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatomes. The patient was able to return to his normal activities, including work and recreational sports.

Throughout the postoperative course, the patient's blood pressure and lipid levels were monitored and remained stable. He did not experience any complications, such as wound infection, pneumonia, or cardiac events. The patient was satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and reported improved quality of life.

In conclusion, this patient's surgical outcome was successful, with improved symptoms and functional ability. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he did not experience any significant complications. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were managed effectively during the perioperative period, and he was able to return to his normal activities without any restrictions.
