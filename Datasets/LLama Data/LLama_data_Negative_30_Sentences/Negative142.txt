Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male, who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. The pain started after a work-related injury eight years ago and has been gradually worsening over time. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy, chiropractic care, and pain medication, but has not found significant relief.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and has been smoking a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. The patient also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six years ago, which provided temporary relief, but the pain has since recurred. The patient has also experienced numbness and tingling sensations in both legs, which have been persistent over the past year.

The patient has been taking hydrocodone and ibuprofen for pain management. The patient has no known allergies to medications and has not experienced any adverse reactions.

The patient's physical examination reveals limited mobility in the lower back and bilateral lower extremities. The patient's straight leg raise test is positive at 45 degrees on the right side and 30 degrees on the left side.

The patient's MRI scan reveals a recurrent lumbar disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1, as well as spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease.

The patient has been scheduled for a repeat lumbar fusion surgery. The procedure will involve a bilateral lumbar decompression and fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had an uneventful surgery and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. The patient's pain was well-controlled with intravenous hydromorphone and was switched to oral hydrocodone the following day.

The patient's respiratory and cardiovascular systems were stable throughout the postoperative period. The patient did not experience any nausea or vomiting.

The patient was able to ambulate independently on the first postoperative day and was discharged home on the second postoperative day.
