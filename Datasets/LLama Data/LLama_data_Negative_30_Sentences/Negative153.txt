I'd be happy to help! However, I'll need some more information to create a patient summary that meets your specifications.  Can you please provide me with the following details:

1. The patient's age, gender, and medical record number
2. The type of surgery the patient is planning to undergo
3. Any relevant medical history, such as previous surgeries, illnesses, or allergies
4. Any medications the patient is currently taking
5. Any preoperative testing or procedures that have been completed
6. The patient's postoperative course, including any complications that occurred
7. Any follow-up appointments or tests that are planned

Once I have this information, I can create a detailed patient summary that includes all of the relevant information you need.
