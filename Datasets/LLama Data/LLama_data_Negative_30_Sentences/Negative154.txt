Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and pain medication, without significant relief. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is a current smoker.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed to resolve his pain. He has since developed decreased mobility and has been unable to work due to his condition.

Preoperatively, the patient was noted to have an elevated BMI and was counseled on the risks of surgery, including wound complications, respiratory issues, and venous thromboembolism. He was optimized for surgery, including discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications.

The patient underwent a repeat lumbar fusion surgery, which proceeded uneventfully. He had an uncomplicated postoperative course, with adequate pain management and good wound healing.

The patient developed a postoperative urinary tract infection, which was treated with antibiotics. He also experienced some postoperative nausea and vomiting, which were managed with antiemetics.

The patient was discharged home on postoperative day five, with a plan for follow-up with his surgeon and primary care physician. He was advised to continue physical therapy and gradually increase his activity level.

At his two-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported improved pain and mobility, with minimal residual discomfort. He was able to return to work part-time and gradually increase his hours as tolerated.

At his six-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported continued improvement in his pain and mobility, with no significant complications or adverse events. He was noted to have a mildly elevated white blood cell count, which was monitored closely.

At his three-month follow-up appointment, the patient reported significant improvement in his pain and mobility, with minimal residual discomfort. He was able to return to work full-time and resume all his preoperative activities without restriction.

The patient's postoperative course was otherwise uncomplicated, without any further complications or adverse events. He was noted to have a slight increase in his BMI, which was counseled and monitored closely.

In summary, the patient underwent a successful repeat lumbar fusion surgery, with an uncomplicated postoperative course and good clinical outcomes. He experienced a minor postoperative complication of urinary tract infection, which was effectively managed. The patient's pain and mobility improved significantly, and he was able to return to work and resume all his preoperative activities without restriction.
