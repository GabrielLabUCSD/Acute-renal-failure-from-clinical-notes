Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. He has a history of lumbar spine degenerative disc disease and has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but has no history of cardiovascular disease or pulmonary disease. He is a current smoker and has a history of alcohol use disorder, but denies any recent alcohol consumption. The patient is allergic to penicillin and has a history of non-severe asthma.

Surgical History:

The patient underwent a lumbar spine fusion surgery 10 years ago, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. However, his pain has since recurred and he has been advised to undergo a revision spine surgery.

Current Symptoms:

The patient presents with persistent back pain and bilateral leg pain, which radiates down to his feet. He also experiences numbness and tingling sensations in his legs and feet. The patient has difficulty ambulating due to his pain and has been using a cane for assistance.

Medications:

The patient is currently taking ibuprofen, gabapentin, and tramadol for pain management. He has been advised to discontinue his medications preoperatively, except for his antihypertensive medications.

Preoperative Testing:

The patient has undergone preoperative testing, including an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and pulmonary function tests, which have shown no significant abnormalities. His blood work has shown mild anemia and elevated liver function test results, but these are believed to be related to his chronic alcohol use.

Surgical Plan:

The patient is scheduled to undergo a revision lumbar spine fusion surgery. The surgical plan includes a posterior approach, fusions from L3-S1, and the use of instrumentation.

Postoperative Course:

The patient tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. He experienced some nausea and vomiting, which were managed with antiemetics. The patient's pain was well-controlled with narcotic medications and he was able to ambulate with assistance on the first postoperative day. He was transferred to the surgical ward on the second postoperative day and continued to recover well.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any significant complications during his postoperative course. He did report some mild urinary retention, which was managed with bladder catheterization. The patient's wound healed well and he was discharged home on the seventh postoperative day.

Follow-up:

The patient followed up with his surgeon at the two-week mark, at which time his wound was noted to be healing well. He reported some ongoing back pain, but this was expected given the early postoperative stage. The patient was advised to continue with his pain management regimen and to follow up with his primary care physician for further monitoring of his blood work abnormalities.

Conclusion:

The patient underwent successful revision lumbar spine fusion surgery and tolerated the procedure well. He did not experience any significant complications during his postoperative course and was discharged home within a week. The patient will continue to follow up with his surgeon and primary care physician for further monitoring and management of his condition.
