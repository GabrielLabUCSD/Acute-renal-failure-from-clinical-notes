Patient Summary:

 The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and decreased mobility. He has been smoking for the past 20 years and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has tried physical therapy and medication without significant improvement. He is planning to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery. 

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He has no known allergies and is currently taking aspirin and lisinopril. He denies any recent illnesses or hospitalizations. 

On physical examination, his vital signs are stable, and he has mild tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. His neurological examination is normal. 

The patient's lab results show mild anemia and elevated liver enzymes. His INR is 1.8. 

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery without any complications. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 with a stable condition. 

On follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his pain and mobility. He was able to return to work within 6 weeks. 

However, on further follow-up, the patient complained of increased pain and discomfort in his lower back. Imaging studies revealed a pseudarthrosis at the site of the fusion. 

The patient underwent a repeat surgery for revision of the pseudarthrosis. Unfortunately, this surgery was complicated by a wound infection, which was treated with antibiotics. 

After treatment of the infection, the patient's wound healed, and he was able to resume his normal activities without any significant residual deficits. 

 The patient's course was further complicated by the development of deep vein thrombosis, which was treated with anticoagulation therapy. 

The patient is currently being monitored closely, and his condition is stable. He has been advised to continue his medications and follow up regularly to ensure that there are no further complications. 

Overall, the patient's postoperative course has been complicated by a pseudarthrosis, wound infection, and deep vein thrombosis. Despite these complications, the patient has shown significant improvement in his pain and mobility, and is expected to make a full recovery.
