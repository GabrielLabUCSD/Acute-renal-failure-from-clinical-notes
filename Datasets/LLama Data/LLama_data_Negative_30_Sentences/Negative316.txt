Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male, who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. He has been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. The patient has tried physical therapy and medication but has not found significant relief. He is a candidate for a lumbar fusion surgery.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is currently taking medication for these conditions. He has no known allergies to medications. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.

The patient has a history of abdominal surgery ten years ago for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He experienced no complications during the postoperative period.

The patient's surgical plan includes a lumbar fusion with instrumentation. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. 

Postoperative Care:

The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours. He will be transferred to the surgical ward on the second postoperative day. Pain management will include patient-controlled analgesia and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

The patient will be encouraged to mobilize as soon as possible after surgery. He will start with bedside exercises, progressing to walking and then climbing stairs.

The patient will follow a liquid diet for the first 24 hours and then progress to a soft diet.

The patient's wound will be closed with sutures and covered with a sterile dressing. He will be advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for six weeks after surgery.

Complications:

The patient is at risk for developing urinary retention due to the spinal surgery. He will be closely monitored for this complication and will have a urinary catheter inserted if necessary.

The patient is also at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and surgery. He will receive preventive therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin and graduated compression stockings.

The patient is at risk for wound infection; the wound will be closely monitored for signs of infection, and the patient will receive prophylactic antibiotics.

The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to general anesthesia. He will receive appropriate respiratory physiotherapy to minimize this risk.
