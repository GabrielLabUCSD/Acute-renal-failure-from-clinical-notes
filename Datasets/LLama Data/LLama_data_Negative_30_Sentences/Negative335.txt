Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. The patient has a history of smoking and has tried various conservative treatments without relief. The patient has been diagnosed with a herniated disc and spinal stenosis.

The patient will be undergoing a lumbar decompression surgery with fusion. The surgery will involve removing the herniated disc and bone spurs that are pressing on the spinal cord and nerve roots. The patient will also have a fusion of the vertebrae to stabilize the spine.

Preoperatively, the patient will undergo a thorough physical examination and imaging studies to ensure that they are a good candidate for surgery. This will include an MRI, CT scan, and X-rays. The patient will also meet with the anesthesiologist to discuss the anesthesia plan.

Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the ICU for the first 24 hours for any complications. They will receive pain medication and will be encouraged to move around and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent respiratory complications.

The patient will have a wound drain inserted to prevent fluid accumulation at the surgical site. They will also have a urinary catheter inserted to monitor urine output and prevent urinary retention.

The patient will be advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for several weeks after surgery. They will also be instructed to avoid smoking and alcohol consumption for at least 2 weeks after surgery.

The patient will have follow-up appointments with their surgeon and primary care physician to monitor their progress and check for any complications.

The patient is at risk for developing blood clots, so they will be prescribed blood thinners to prevent this complication.

The patient is also at risk for developing a postoperative infection, so they will be prescribed antibiotics to prevent this complication.

The patient is expected to make a full recovery and return to their normal activities within 6-8 weeks after surgery.

Complications that may arise during surgery or postoperatively include bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and wound complications such as hernia or abscess.

However, the patient is in good health overall and is expected to have a successful surgery and uneventful postoperative course.
