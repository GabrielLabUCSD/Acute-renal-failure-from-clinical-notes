Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has been diagnosed with a lumbar disc herniation and has failed conservative management. He is scheduled to undergo a lumbar discectomy.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He denies any recent illnesses or hospitalizations.

On physical examination, the patient has tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine and positive bilateral straight leg raise test. His neurological examination shows L5/S1 radiculopathy with decreased muscle strength and decreased reflexes.

Imaging studies show a large L4-L5 disc herniation with spinal stenosis. There is also evidence of spondylosis and facet joint arthropathy.

The patient underwent lumbar discectomy under general anesthesia. The surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged home on postoperative day 2 with instructions to limit heavy lifting and bending.

Follow-up appointment was scheduled for 2 weeks after surgery, at which time the patient reported significant improvement in his back pain and radiculopathy. He was able to ambulate without difficulty and had normal muscle strength and reflexes.

However, on follow-up appointment 6 weeks after surgery, the patient reported a sudden onset of left thigh pain and weakness. Physical examination showed a decrease in muscle strength and reflexes, and imaging studies revealed a new left femoral neuropraxia.

The patient was diagnosed with a postoperative complication of femoral neuropraxia. He was referred to physical therapy for rehabilitation and had a successful outcome.

The patient had a total of 3 follow-up appointments within 3 months after surgery, and there were no further complications. He reported continued improvement in his back pain and radiculopathy and was able to return to his normal activities without difficulty.

The patient"s postoperative course was uneventful except for the development of femoral neuropraxia, which was successfully treated with physical therapy. He had a satisfactory outcome and was able to return to his normal activities without difficulty.

Overall, the patient"s medical history and postoperative course were significant for a lumbar disc herniation, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a postoperative complication of femoral neuropraxia. He had an uneventful postoperative course except for the development of femoral neuropraxia, which was successfully treated. The patient had a satisfactory outcome and was able to return to his normal activities without difficulty.

I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
