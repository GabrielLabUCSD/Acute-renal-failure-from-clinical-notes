Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain. The pain started after a work-related injury 10 years ago and has been gradually worsening over time. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is currently taking medication for both conditions. He has no history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or respiratory problems.

The patient underwent a lumbar spinal fusion surgery six months ago, which provided some initial relief, but the pain has since recurred. The patient also experiences occasional numbness and tingling sensations in both legs.

The patient's most recent MRI showed evidence of pseudarthrosis at the fusion site, which is likely contributing to the ongoing pain.

The patient is currently considering revision spinal fusion surgery to address the pseudarthrosis.

The patient is otherwise healthy and does not have any significant medical conditions that would contraindicate surgery.

The patient's postoperative course after the initial lumbar spinal fusion surgery was uneventful, with no major complications.

However, the patient did experience some minor discomfort and pain in the immediate postoperative period, which was managed effectively with pain medication.

The patient was able to return to work within six weeks after surgery and has since been able to perform his job duties without any significant limitations.

The patient's current surgical plan is to undergo revision spinal fusion surgery to address the pseudarthrosis.

The surgical approach will be through a posterior incision, and the procedure will involve removing the existing hardware and bone graft, followed by a re-fusion of the spine using new hardware and bone graft material.

The patient will be closely monitored for any signs of neurological deficits or other complications during and after surgery.

The patient is expected to remain in the hospital for several days after surgery for observation and pain management.

The patient will require a period of rest and rehabilitation after discharge from the hospital to ensure a successful recovery.

The patient's prognosis for successful revision spinal fusion surgery is good, with a high likelihood of achieving significant pain relief and improved function.

However, as with any surgical procedure, there are risks involved, including infection, nerve damage, and blood clots.

The patient has been advised to follow a regular exercise program and maintain a healthy lifestyle to minimize the risk of complications and optimize the outcome of the surgery.

In summary, the patient has a history of chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that has been unresponsive to conservative treatment, and he has undergone lumbar spinal fusion surgery in the past, which provided temporary relief but has since recurred. The patient is currently considering revision spinal fusion surgery to address the pseudarthrosis, and his postoperative course has been uneventful so far. The patient is expected to undergo revision spinal fusion surgery soon, and his prognosis for successful surgery is good.
