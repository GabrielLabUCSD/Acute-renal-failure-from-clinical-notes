Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral hip pain. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without relief. He has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He denies any cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or neurological symtoms.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 10 years ago, which provided temporary relief but the pain has since recurred. He also had a left hip arthroscopy 5 years ago for a labral tear, which provided some improvement but the pain has persisted.

The patient's current medications include ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and gabapentin. He has no known allergies. He works as a construction worker and is eager to return to work as soon as possible after surgery.

The patient's surgical plan includes a simultaneous bilateral total hip arthroplasty and lumbar fusion. The patient is interested in minimally invasive surgical techniques and requests to avoid blood transfusions if possible.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had a successful surgery and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. He experienced some postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was managed with antiemetics. He had some pain in the first few days, which was managed with patient-controlled analgesia and was gradually weaned off over time. He also had some constipation, which was managed with laxatives.

The patient was mobilized on the first postoperative day and started physical therapy to regain strength and range of motion. He was able to ambulate independently by the third postoperative day and was discharged home on postoperative day 5.

The patient had a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after discharge, at which point he reported some lingering pain and stiffness in his hips but was generally satisfied with his progress. He was advised to continue physical therapy and was prescribed additional pain medication as needed.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any acute complications during or after surgery. However, he did develop a mild wound infection in his left hip, which was treated with oral antibiotics. He also experienced some persistent numbness and tingling in his left lower extremity, which was monitored closely by his surgeon and eventually resolved on its own.

The patient's recovery was generally uneventful, and he was able to return to work 8 weeks after surgery. He reported significant improvement in his pain and mobility and was satisfied with his surgical outcome.
