Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. The pain started after a work-related injury 10 years ago and has gradually worsened over time. The patient has tried physical therapy, chiropractic care, and pain medication without significant relief. He has difficulty walking long distances and experiences numbness and tingling in his left leg.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication. He has no history of cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.

The patient underwent a laminectomy and fusion surgery 5 years ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed to resolve the pain. He has since developed a pseudarthrosis at the surgical site.

The patient has been scheduled for a revision spinal surgery, which includes a posterior lumbar interbody fusion and instrumentation. The surgery is planned to take place under general anesthesia.

The patient"s postoperative course has been complicated by a pulmonary embolism, which was diagnosed on the second postoperative day. He was treated with anticoagulation therapy and showed improvement within a few days. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 7.

The patient experienced some wound discomfort and required pain medication for several weeks after discharge. However, his pain has gradually improved, and he has regained some mobility in his left leg. He has been advised to continue physical therapy to strengthen his back muscles and prevent future recurrences of pain.

Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care physician have been scheduled to follow the patient"s progress and manage any ongoing issues. The patient has been informed of the potential risks and complications associated with the surgery and has provided informed consent.

The patient will need to take time off work to recover from the surgery and will require assistance with activities of daily living during the early postoperative period. He has arranged for support from family members and friends to help with his care during this time.

In conclusion, the patient presents with a complex medical history, including a previous spinal surgery and current pseudarthrosis, which has resulted in chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. While the patient"s postoperative course was complicated by a pulmonary embolism, he has shown improvement with appropriate treatment and will require continued management and follow-up to ensure optimal outcomes.
