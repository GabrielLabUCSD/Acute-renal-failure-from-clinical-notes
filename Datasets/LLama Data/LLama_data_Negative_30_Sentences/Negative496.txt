Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and limited mobility. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has no known allergies and is currently taking aspirin and ibuprofen for pain management.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed to address the underlying issues. He has since developed worsening low back and radicular pain, as well as decreased sensation and reflexes in his lower extremities.

Preoperative evaluation revealed a healthy patient with stable vital signs and normal laboratory results. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were within normal limits. The patient's neurological examination revealed decreased sensation and reflexes in his lower extremities, consistent with neuropraxia.

The patient underwent a successful decompression surgery, and postoperative recovery was uneventful. He was discharged home on postoperative day two with instructions to rest and avoid any strenuous activities.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and manage postoperative pain. The patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms and mobility at his two-week follow-up appointment.

At his six-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported some increase in lower back pain, which was managed with a tapering course of steroids and NSAIDs.

At his three-month follow-up appointment, the patient reported continued improvement in his symptoms, with near-complete resolution of his radicular pain and improved sensation and reflexes in his lower extremities. He was able to ambulate without assistance and had resumed his normal activities.

There were no complications during the patient's postoperative course.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgery and uneventful postoperative recovery, with significant improvement in his symptoms and mobility. He was able to resume his normal activities and reported satisfaction with his care.
