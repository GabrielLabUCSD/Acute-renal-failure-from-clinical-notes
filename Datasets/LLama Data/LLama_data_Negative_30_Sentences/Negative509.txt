Patient Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and limited mobility. The patient has a history of smoking and alcohol use. The patient has been previously diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and spinal stenosis. The patient has tried physical therapy and pain management without significant relief. The patient is planning to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to alleviate the chronic back pain and improve mobility.

The patient's surgical history includes a past cholecystectomy and hernia repair. The patient has no known allergies to medications and does not take any medications regularly. The patient does not have a history of bleeding disorders or previous anesthesia complications. The patient's family history is unremarkable for cardiovascular disease or anesthesia complications. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 70 bpm, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals limited range of motion in the lower back and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. The patient has a BMI of 32. 

The patient's laboratory results show a normal complete blood count and electrolyte panel. The patient's liver function tests show a mild hyperbilirubinemia, but the patient does not have any evidence of acute renal failure. The patient'sINR is 1.2, and the patient's blood type is A positive. 

The patient is scheduled for a lumbar fusion surgery under general anesthesia. The patient will receive a neuromuscular blockade for surgical anesthesia. The patient will be positioned on their stomach for the surgical procedure. The surgeon will use a surgical drain to control bleeding during the procedure. 

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was able to extubate quickly and was transferred to the PACU for recovery. The patient experienced some nausea and vomiting in the PACU, which was treated with ondansetron. The patient's pain was well controlled with patient-controlled analgesia. 

The patient experienced some urinary retention on the first postoperative day, which resolved with foley catheter insertion. The patient did not experience any respiratory complications during their hospital stay. 

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 without any complications. The patient will follow up with the surgeon's office for wound check and suture removal. 

The patient's prognosis for successful surgical outcome and improved mobility is good. However, the patient will need to follow a rehabilitation program to optimize the surgical outcome. The patient will also need to continue smoking cessation and weight loss to prevent future complications of degenerative disc disease.
