Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. He has a history of smoking and has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and pain management, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and has been taking aspirin and simvastatin regularly. 

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery four years ago, which provided temporary relief but ultimately failed. He has since developed severe left-sided sciatica and has been experiencing worsening pain in recent months. The patient had a recent MRI that showed recurrent disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1, as well as spinal stenosis. 

The patient has been referred for a lumbar revision surgery and will undergo a multilevel fusion. The patient has a history of postoperative nausea and vomiting and has requested general anesthesia for the procedure. The patient has also reported occasional constipation and has been taking Colace as needed. 

Postoperative Course:

The patient had an uneventful intraoperative course and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. The patient had some nausea and vomiting in the PACU, but it was manageable with medication. The patient was discharged from the PACU and transferred to the surgical floor for further recovery. 

The patient had some pain in the immediate postoperative period, but it was effectively managed with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and regional anesthesia. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication on the first postoperative day and tolerated it well. The patient also experienced some constipation, which was treated with Colace and fluids. 

The patient had a smooth postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any major complications during his hospital stay. He had some mild urinary retention on the second postoperative day, but it resolved with bladder training and fluid intake. The patient also developed some mild swelling in his lower extremities, but it responded well to elevation and compression stockings. The patient had no signs of wound infection or bleeding.

Follow-up:

The patient had a follow-up appointment with his surgeon one week after discharge, at which point he was doing well and reporting satisfactory pain relief. The patient was advised to continue with his current pain management regimen and to gradually resume his normal activities. The patient was also referred to physical therapy to help with rehabilitation and prevent further complications.
