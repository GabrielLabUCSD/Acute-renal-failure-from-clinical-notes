Physical Examination:

* The patient's vital signs are within normal limits.
* The patient has a moderate-sized abdominal scar from the previous surgery.
* The patient has decreased sensation in his lower extremities, consistent with neuropathy.
* The patient has mild postoperative edema in his legs.

Lab Results:

* The patient's complete blood count and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.
* The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are slightly elevated, consistent with mild renal insufficiency.

Imaging Studies:

* The patient's preoperative MRI showed a large L4-L5disk herniation and spinal stenosis.
* The patient's postoperative X-rays showed good fusion and no evidence of hardware failure.

Plan:

* The patient will undergo spinal fusion surgery to alleviate chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain.
* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of postoperative complications, such as infection, bleeding, or respiratory compromise.
* The patient will receive aggressive pain management, including patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and scheduled doses of oxycodone.
* The patient will be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible after surgery to prevent postoperative complications.
* The patient will follow up with the surgeon and primary care physician for postoperative care and monitoring.

Complications:
