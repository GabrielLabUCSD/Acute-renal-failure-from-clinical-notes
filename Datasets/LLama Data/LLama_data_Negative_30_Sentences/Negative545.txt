Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and left leg radiculopathy. The patient has been smoking for the past 20 years and has a history of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia. The patient has tried conservative management including physical therapy and medications without significant relief. The patient is currently taking Aspirin, Lisinopril, and Simvastatin.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 5 years ago, which provided temporary relief but the pain has since returned. The patient has been advised to undergo a revision lumbar fusion surgery.

The patient's surgical history also includes a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. The patient has no known allergies and has a negative history of bleeding disorders. The patient is currently taking aspirin and lisinopril, and has been advised to hold these medications preoperatively.

The patient's imaging studies include a MRI of the lumbar spine which shows a Pseudarthrosis at L5-S1 with incomplete fusion and spinal stenosis.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a revision lumbar fusion surgery. The surgeon plans to perform a posterior approach, decompress the spinal cord and nerve roots, and fuse the spine from L3-S1 with instrumentation.

The patient's postoperative course is anticipated to be uneventful. The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours for any signs of neurological compromise or respiratory distress.
