Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male, who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has been smoking for 20 years and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and has been compliant with medications and lifestyle modifications since then. He has also been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure machine. The patient has a history of chronic non-healing wounds on his lower extremities, which have been managed with frequent dressing changes and antibiotics.

Preoperative Workup:
The patient underwent a thorough preoperative workup, which included a cardiology consultation, pulmonology consultation, and a high-risk surgical assessment. The patient's electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and stress test were within normal limits. His lung function test showed mild restriction and a positive bronchodilator response. The patient's blood work showed an elevated white blood cell count, which was attributed to his chronic wounds.

Surgical Procedure:
The patient underwent a lumbar fusion with instrumentation. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia and took approximately 4 hours to complete. The patient had no intraoperative complications and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.

Postoperative Course:
The patient had a smooth postoperative course. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring due to his chronic medical conditions and high-risk surgical status. The patient experienced some postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was managed with antiemetics. He was able to tolerate fluids and solids on the first postoperative day and his pain was well-controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The patient's wounds were clean and dry on the first postoperative day.

Complications:
The patient did not experience any acute complications during his hospital stay. However, on the third postoperative day, the patient developed a low-grade fever, which was managed with antibiotics. The patient's wounds continued to heal properly, and he was discharged from the hospital on the seventh postoperative day.

Follow-up:
The patient followed up with his surgeon's office on the 14th postoperative day. At that time, his wounds were completely healed, and he had a significant improvement in his back pain. The patient was able to ambulate without assistance and was optimistic about his postoperative outcome.
