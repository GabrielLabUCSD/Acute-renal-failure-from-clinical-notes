Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has been smoke-free for 5 years and drinks occasionally. He has no known drug allergies. He has a history of shoulder and knee injuries, and he had a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. He takes aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and hydrocodone as needed for pain. He has been experiencing worsening left knee pain for the past year, and an MRI revealed a large osteochondral defect. He underwent a left knee arthroscopic microfracture and osteochondral autograft transfer 3 months ago, but his pain persists. He is now considering a total knee arthroplasty.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had a smooth postoperative course after his arthroscopic microfracture and osteochondral autograft transfer. He was discharged on postoperative day 2 and completed a course of physical therapy. He experienced some mild pain and swelling, but it was manageable with pain medication. He was able to return to work as a desk worker within 6 weeks.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any complications after his postoperative course. He had a follow-up appointment with his surgeon 6 weeks after the procedure, and his knee was stable and showed signs of improvement. He was advised to continue with physical therapy and a gradual return to full activity.

Recommendations:

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is recommended that he undergo a total knee arthroplasty. The patient's persistent pain and limited mobility indicate that conservative management has been ineffective, and surgical intervention is necessary. The patient's age and general health status suggest that he is a suitable candidate for surgery. It is important for the patient to continue with physical therapy and follow postoperative instructions closely to ensure a optimal outcome.
