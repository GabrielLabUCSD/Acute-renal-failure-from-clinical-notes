Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral sciatica. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is currently taking medication for both conditions. He is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. The patient has no known allergies.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, and he experienced significant improvement in his back pain and sciatica. However, he recently started experiencing new onset left-sided chest pain, which was diagnosed as angina. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed a 90% occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. He was advised to undergo a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course after the lumbar fusion surgery. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day five and was able to return to work after six weeks. He did not experience any complications during his postoperative course.

The patient is now scheduled to undergo a CABG surgery. He is at increased risk for postoperative complications due to his history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgery. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of complications, such as myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, or wound infections.

The patient has been informed of the risks and benefits of the surgery, and he has provided informed consent. He will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for the first 24 hours after surgery and will receive aggressive pain management and prophylactic anticoagulation therapy. The patient will also be closely monitored for signs of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

In conclusion, the patient presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral sciatica, which was recently managed with a lumbar fusion surgery. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is at increased risk for postoperative complications. The patient will undergo a CABG surgery, and close monitoring is necessary to ensure a smooth postoperative course.
