Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for elective surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). He had a myocardial infarction (MI) 5 years ago and has been compliant with aspirin and beta-blocker therapy since then. He has also been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is on bronchodilator therapy. He has no history of bleeding disorders or previous surgeries.

Preoperative evaluation revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12,000 cells/mm3. His preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias.

The patient underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The surgery was uneventful, and he was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery.

Postoperative course:

The patient was extubated in the PACU and was able to breathe spontaneously. He had some postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) that was managed with ondansetron. He had a patent airway and was able to maintain his oxygen saturation above 95% on room air.

He was monitored closely for signs of postoperative complications, including bleeding, infection, and respiratory failure. He was also monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias.

The patient had a smooth postoperative recovery and was able to drink fluids and eat solid food within the first 24 hours. He was able to mobilize and sit in a chair on the first postoperative day. He had some mild postoperative pain that was managed with scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids.

He was discharged home on the second postoperative day with instructions to take his medications as directed and to follow up with his surgeon and primary care physician.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any postoperative complications. He did not develop any signs of bleeding, infection, or respiratory failure. He did not experience any cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias.

Follow-up:

The patient followed up with his surgeon and primary care physician as directed. He was seen in the clinic 2 weeks after discharge and reported no issues with wound healing or postoperative recovery. His blood pressure and heart rate were within normal limits, and his WBC count had normalized. He was advised to continue taking his medications as directed and to follow up in 6 weeks to check his progress.

Conclusion:

The patient had a successful elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and an uneventful postoperative recovery. He did not experience any postoperative complications and was discharged home on the second postoperative day. He followed up with his surgeon and primary care physician as directed and was doing well at his 2-week follow-up appointment.
