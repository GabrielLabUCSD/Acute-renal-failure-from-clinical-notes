After reviewing the patient's history, it is important to consider the potential risks and complications associated with surgery, such as bleeding, infection, and respiratory and cardiovascular complications. The patient's history of smoking and sleep apnea may increase the risk of respiratory complications, while the patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. Additionally, the patient's history of COPD and previous NSTEMI may increase the risk of respiratory complications. It is important to closely monitor the patient's postoperative course and address any complications promptly.
