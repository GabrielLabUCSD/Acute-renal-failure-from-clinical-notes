Note: The patient's history of hypertension, smoking, and heavy alcohol use may increase the risk of postoperative complications, such as cardiovascular events or respiratory problems. However, these factors do not necessarily preclude the patient from undergoing surgery. The patient's previous history of appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair may also increase the risk of complications, such as adhesions or bowel obstruction. However, these risks are generally low and can be managed with proper surgical technique and postoperative care. The patient's family history of colon cancer increases the risk of developing colon cancer, which is the indication for the planned surgery.
