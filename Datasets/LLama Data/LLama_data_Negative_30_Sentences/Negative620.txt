Sure, here's a sample patient summary with 30 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He has a history of smoking, but quit 10 years ago. He has a history of alcohol use, but denies any recent alcohol consumption. He has a history of stage II pressure ulcers and was recently diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. He has also had a history of atrial fibrillation and was placed on warfarin, but had a bleeding episode and was transitioned to apixaban. He has a history of chronic low back pain and has tried various medications, including opioids, without significant relief. He has a history of sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. He has a history of hypothyroidism and takes levothyroxine. He has a history of non-melanoma skin cancer and had a skin excision 10 years ago. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and takes tamsulosin. He has a history of prostate cancer and underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) 5 years ago. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III and takes lisinopril.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, tamsulosin, and lisinopril. He does not have any known allergies to medications.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and a cataract surgery. He has no history of previous anesthesia complications.

The patient's postoperative course has been uneventful. He experienced some mild postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was managed with ondansetron. He did not require any respiratory support. He had some mild pain, which was managed with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. He did not have any urinary retention or other complications. He was discharged on postoperative day 2 and followed up with his surgeon 1 week later.

The patient's postoperative complications include a mild wound infection, which was treated with oral antibiotics, and a mild seroma, which resolved on its own. He did not have any other complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or cardiac arrhythmias. He did not require any unplanned admissions or readmissions.

The patient's current status is stable. He is able to ambulate independently and perform his activities of daily living without any difficulty. He has no shortness of breath, chest pain, or other symptoms. He is scheduled to follow up with his surgeon in 2 weeks and with his primary care physician in 4 weeks.

I hope this sample patient summary is helpful. Please note that this is just a sample and should be individualized to the specific patient's medical history and postoperative course.
