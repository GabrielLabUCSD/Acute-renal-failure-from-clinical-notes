Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. He has tried various treatments, including physical therapy and pain medication, without significant relief. The patient has a history of smoking and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. He has no known allergies and takes no medications.

The patient underwent a thorough physical examination, including range of motion, strength, and neurological assessments. Results showed decreased lumbar flexion, tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, and decreased sensation in the bilateral lower extremities. Imaging studies, including X-rays and MRI, revealed multilevel degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis.

The patient was scheduled for a lumbar fusion surgery. Preoperative workup included blood work, electrocardiogram, and pulmonary function tests, which were all within normal limits. The patient was admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery and received general anesthesia.

The surgical procedure involved a posterior lumbar fusion with instrumentation. The operation was successful, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Postoperative course:

The patient had a uneventful postoperative course. He experienced some pain, which was managed with pain medication. He was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent respiratory complications. The patient had no nausea or vomiting and tolerated liquids and solids well.

On the first postoperative day, the patient had a temperature of 100.4Â°F. Blood cultures were drawn, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started empirically. The patient's white blood cell count was 12,000 cells/mm3, and C-reactive protein was 150 mg/L.

On the second postoperative day, the patient's fever persisted, and a chest X-ray was ordered. The X-ray showed a possible infiltrate in the right lung base. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.

On the third postoperative day, the patient's fever resolved, and blood cultures were negative. The patient continued to receive antibiotics and was transitioned to oral medication. The patient's pain was well-controlled, and he was able to ambulate independently.

On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was transferred to a regular floor. He continued to recover well and was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day.

The patient had a follow-up appointment with the surgeon and reported minimal pain and improved mobility. He was advised to continue physical therapy and was prescribed medication for pain management.

At six months follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms and was able to perform daily activities without pain. He had full range of motion in his lower back and was able to ambulate without assistance.

In conclusion, this patient had a successful lumbar fusion surgery and an uneventful postoperative course, except for a brief episode of fever and a possible infiltrate on the second postoperative day. The patient was closely monitored and received appropriate treatment for his symptoms. He had a smooth recovery and reported significant improvement in his symptoms at follow-up.
