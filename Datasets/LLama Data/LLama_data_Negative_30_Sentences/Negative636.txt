Sure, here's a sample patient summary with 30 sentences describing a patient's medical history, postoperative course, and complications:

Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He presents with a 2-year history of worsening left knee pain, consistent with osteoarthritis. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and NSAIDs, without significant improvement. He has no history of previous knee surgery or joint replacements.

The patient's surgical history includes an appendectomy at age 25 and a cholecystectomy at age 50. He has no history of cardiovascular disease or pulmonary disease. He takes aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin daily.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild tenderness to palpation over the left knee joint, with moderate swelling and limited range of motion. His neurovascular examination is normal.

The patient's laboratory results reveal a normal complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and coagulation studies. His creatinine kinase level is mildly elevated at 150 U/L.

The patient underwent left knee arthroscopy with meniscectomy and chondroplasty. The surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient tolerated it well.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with minimal pain managed with opioids and NSAIDs. He was discharged on postoperative day 2 with instructions to continue his medications and physical therapy.

Follow-up at 2 weeks revealed mild improvement in knee pain and swelling, with increased mobility. At 6 weeks, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and function, with near-full range of motion.

At 12 weeks, the patient had a significant setback, experiencing worsening knee pain and swelling. Imaging studies revealed a diagnosis of hardware failure, likely due to poor wound healing.

The patient underwent urgent surgical intervention, with removal of the hardware and reinforcement of the knee joint. The surgery was successful, and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful.

Follow-up at 6 months revealed near-full recovery, with minimal pain and full range of motion. The patient was able to return to his normal activities, including walking and gardening.

Complications:

* Postoperative wound infection (treated with antibiotics)
* Postoperative urinary retention (managed with catheterization)
* Hardware failure (requiring additional surgery)

The patient's overall outcome was considered successful, with significant improvement in knee pain and function. However, the postoperative complications and hardware failure were unexpected and required additional interventions.
