Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The patient had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and has been compliant with his medications and lifestyle modifications since then. He also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was previously a smoker but has since quit.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy 5 years ago, and he has had no previous anesthesia complications. He is currently taking aspirin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. He has no known allergies to medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, and respiratory rate of 16 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea. His abdominal examination shows a scar from his previous cholecystectomy, and there is no tenderness or guarding.

The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, except for a mild elevation in his serum creatinine level. His creatinine clearance is 80 mL/min.

The patient is scheduled for a colonoscopy with polypectomy. The anesthesia plan is for a general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had an uneventful anesthesia and surgery. He was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the recovery room. His blood pressure and heart rate were stable during the recovery period.

The patient was transferred to the ward after 2 hours of observation in the recovery room. He had some nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery but responded well to antiemetics. He was able to tolerate oral fluids and had a soft diet on the first postoperative day.

The patient's pain was well controlled with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and was weaned off the PCA on the second postoperative day. He had no evidence of respiratory or cardiac complications during his hospital stay.

Complications:

The patient did not have any postoperative complications. He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day.

Conclusion:

The patient had a successful surgery and uneventful postoperative course. His medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and NIDDM were well controlled, and he did not experience any complications related to these conditions during his hospital stay. The patient's creatinine clearance was mildly elevated, but this did not pose a significant concern for the anesthesia and surgery. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day and is expected to make a full recovery.
