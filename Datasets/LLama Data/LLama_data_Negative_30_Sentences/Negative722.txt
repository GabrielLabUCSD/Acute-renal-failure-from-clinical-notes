Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. He has been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis.

The patient"s postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 2. He experienced some mild pain and discomfort, which was managed with pain medication. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting or bending for 6 weeks.

During his follow-up appointment 2 weeks after surgery, the patient reported improved pain and mobility. He was able to walk longer distances without assistance and had improved range of motion in his lower back.

However, at his 6-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported new-onset left lower extremity numbness and weakness. He was referred for physical therapy and began a course of gabapentin for neuropathic pain.
