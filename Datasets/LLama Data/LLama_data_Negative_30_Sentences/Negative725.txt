Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. The pain started after a work-related injury 10 years ago and has been gradually worsening over time. The patient has tried various treatments, including physical therapy, pain medication, and epidural injections, without significant relief. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity.

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery six months ago, which provided only temporary relief. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and they were discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day. However, the patient's pain started to recur a few weeks after the surgery, and they developed new onset of right leg numbness.

The patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation and management. A repeat MRI scan revealed a recurrent disc herniation at the same level as the previous surgery. The patient underwent a repeat lumbar fusion surgery with instrumentation and bone grafting. The postoperative course was complicated by a wound infection, which was treated with antibiotics. The patient also developed a pulmonary embolism, which was managed with anticoagulation therapy. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 10th postoperative day.

Following discharge, the patient experienced significant improvement in their pain and numbness. They were able to resume their normal activities, including work and exercise, without any restrictions. However, the patient continued to experience some residual numbness in their right leg, which was managed with physical therapy.

Overall, the patient's surgical and postoperative course was complex, with a few complications that were effectively managed. The patient had a good outcome and was able to achieve significant pain relief and functional improvement.
