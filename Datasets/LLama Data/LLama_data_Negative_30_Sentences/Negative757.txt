Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for elective surgery. He has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The patient has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years and has a history of alcohol use disorder. He denies any significant allergies.

The patient has had a previous myocardial infarction (MI) 5 years ago and has been compliant with his medications since then. He also had a history of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) 2 years ago. The patient has been experiencing some urinary retention and frequency recently, which is likely related to his BPH.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy 10 years ago and a hernia repair 5 years ago. He has no history of previous anesthesia complications.

The patient's current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. He also takes aspirin daily for his MI history.

The patient's physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C).

The patient's laboratory results show a normal complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, and liver function test (LFT). His serum creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias. His echocardiogram shows mildleft ventricular hypertrophy and a normal ejection fraction.

The patient's respiratory function test shows a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 3.5 liters (80% predicted), and a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 4.8 liters (90% predicted).

The patient's postoperative course is expected to be uneventful. He will be closely monitored for any signs of surgical site infection, bleeding, or respiratory complications. He will also be monitored for his blood glucose levels and fluid management.

Complications:

The patient had a postoperative fever on the second day, which was managed with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. He also had some nausea and vomiting on the first postoperative day, which was managed with ondansetron. The patient did not experience any respiratory or cardiac complications during his hospital stay.

Discharge:

The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day in stable condition. He was advised to follow up with his surgeon and primary care physician within a week. He was also advised to take his medications as prescribed and to monitor his wound site for any signs of infection.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this patient's medical history and postoperative course were significant for his hypertension, hyperlipidemia, NIDDM, and history of MI. He had a previous TURP and cholecystectomy without any anesthesia complications. His laboratory results were largely normal, except for mild renal insufficiency. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, except for a brief fever and nausea. He was discharged in stable condition and advised to follow up with his healthcare providers.
