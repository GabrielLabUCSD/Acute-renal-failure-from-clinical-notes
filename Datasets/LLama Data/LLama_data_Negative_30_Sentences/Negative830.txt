Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and decreased mobility.

The patient will be closely monitored during the surgery to minimize the risk of complications.

Postoperative Course:

The patient will be closely monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for several hours after the surgery. He will be given pain medication to manage any discomfort or pain. The patient will be encouraged to move around and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent pulmonary complications.

The patient will be transferred to the surgical floor once he is stable and will continue to receive pain medication and be closely monitored. He will be encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises regularly. The patient will also receive physical therapy to help regain strength and mobility in his lower back.

Complications:

The patient has been informed of the potential risks and complications associated with the surgery, including infection, nerve damage, and blood clots. The patient has also been informed of the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can be life-threatening if they break loose and travel to the lungs.

He has been able to manage his pain effectively with medication and has been ambulating regularly. The patient has also been following his physical therapy regimen and has been able to regain some strength and mobility in his lower back.

Discharge:

He will be prescribed pain medication and will be instructed on how to care for his wounds and prevent infection. The patient will also be referred to outpatient physical therapy to continue his rehabilitation.

Follow-up:
