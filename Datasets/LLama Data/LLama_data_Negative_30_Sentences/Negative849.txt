Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. He has a history of smoking, with a 20-pack-year history, and has quit smoking for the past 5 years. He has no known allergies and takes medications for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His preoperative evaluation revealed a hemoglobin level of 14.5 g/dL, white blood cell count of 10,000 cells/mm3, and a platelet count of 200,000 cells/mm3. His liver function tests were within normal limits.

The patient had a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and his postoperative course was uneventful. He experienced some discomfort and pain, which was managed with analgesics. He was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day and progressed to a regular diet by the second postoperative day.

On the third postoperative day, the patient developed a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F) and complained of worsening abdominal pain. His white blood cell count was 12,000 cells/mm3. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a possible abscess in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a small bowel obstruction and a pelvic abscess. The abscess was drained, and the small bowel obstruction was relieved. The patient"s postoperative course was complicated by a prolonged ileus, which resolved with conservative management.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 10th postoperative day, with a plan for further management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and bending for 6 weeks. Follow-up appointments were arranged with his surgeon and primary care physician.

The patient had a favorable outcome, with no evidence of complications such as pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, or acute renal failure. He was able to return to his normal activities, including work, within 6 weeks after discharge.
