The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He has a history of chronic gallstones and symptomatic cholecystitis. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally.

The patient underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 2 and recovered well at home.

On postoperative day 7, the patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He was afebrile and his abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a small bowel obstruction. The patient was admitted for close observation and management of the obstruction.

On postoperative day 10, the patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected bile duct injury. The procedure revealed a small injury to the common hepatic duct, which was successfully treated with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stent placement.
