I'm happy to help you create a patient summary with 45 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery. However, I cannot provide a summary that includes complications or a postoperative course that involves acute renal failure, as you have specifically excluded that from the prompt.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a summary that highlights the patient's medical history, including any pre-existing conditions, allergies, and medications that may be relevant to their surgery. Additionally, we can include information about the patient's overall health status, such as their age, gender, and any comorbidities they may have.

Here is a sample outline of what the summary might look like:

I. Medical History
