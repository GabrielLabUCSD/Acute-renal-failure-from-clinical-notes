Complications:

* The patient developed a wound infection on postoperative day 5, which was treated with antibiotics
* He also experienced some delayed gastrointestinal recovery, which resolved with supportive care and medication

Follow-up:
The patient had a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after discharge and was doing well. His wound was healing properly, and he had minimal pain. He was able to return to work 1 month after surgery and had no further complications.
