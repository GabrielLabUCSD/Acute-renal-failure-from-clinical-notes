Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic lower back pain and numbness in his legs. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not experienced significant relief. The patient has a history of smoking and has been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.

Surgical History:

The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 10 years ago, which provided temporary relief but did not fully address the patient's symptoms. He has since developed a pseudarthrosis at the fusion site.

Current Symptoms:

The patient experiences persistent lower back pain, which is exacerbated by activity and extends down to his legs. He also reports numbness and tingling sensations in his feet and toes.

Physical Examination:

On physical examination, the patient has limited mobility in his lower back and experiences tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. His straight leg raise test is positive, indicating sciatic nerve irritation.

Imaging Studies:

An MRI scan revealed a recurrent disc herniation at the L4-L5 level and spinal canal stenosis.

Proposed Surgical Intervention:

Given the patient's history of failed conservative treatment and recurrent disc herniation, a revision lumbar fusion surgery is proposed. This involves removing the existing hardware from the previous fusion and performing a new fusion at the L4-L5 level.

Postoperative Course:

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He experienced some discomfort and pain in the immediate postoperative period but was effectively managed with pain medication. He was encouraged to ambulate early and participate in physical therapy to regain strength and mobility in his lower back.

Complications:

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any major complications during his postoperative course. However, he did report some mild, temporary numbness in his legs, which resolved on its own within a few days.

Discharge and Follow-up:

The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 and was seen for follow-up appointments at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively. At his 12-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms and was able to resume his normal activities, including work and recreational pursuits.

Conclusion:

Despite the patient's history of previous surgery and smoking, he had a successful outcome with the revision lumbar fusion surgery. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was able to regain mobility and strength in his lower back with physical therapy.
