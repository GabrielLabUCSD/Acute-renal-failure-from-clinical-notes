The patient underwent a lumbar fusion surgery 5 years ago, which provided temporary relief but the pain has since returned. The patient has also had three epidural steroid injections, which provided short-term relief but did not address the underlying cause of the pain.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a prolonged ileus, which resolved with conservative management. The patient also experienced some wound discomfort and numbness in the lower extremities, which resolved over time.
