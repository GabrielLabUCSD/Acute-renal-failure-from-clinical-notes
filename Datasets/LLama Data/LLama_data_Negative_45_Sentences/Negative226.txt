I'm happy to help you with that! However, I want to point out that creating a patient summary with 45 sentences may not be the most efficient or effective way to communicate the patient's medical history. It's important to prioritize the most relevant information and avoid including unnecessary details to ensure that the summary is concise and easy to understand.

Can you tell me a little bit more about the patient's medical history and the type of surgery they are planning to have? This will help me create a more tailored summary that focuses on the most important information. Additionally, I'll make sure to exclude acute renal failure as a complication as per your request.
