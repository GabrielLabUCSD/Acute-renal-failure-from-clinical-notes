Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not experienced significant relief. The patient is a candidate for spinal fusion surgery to address his chronic back pain and improve his quality of life.

Preoperative Workup:

The patient underwent a thorough preoperative workup, which included a physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. The patient's blood work revealed a normal white blood cell count and serum electrolyte levels. A preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram were also performed and showed normal results.

Surgical Procedure:

The patient underwent a posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) procedure, which involved the insertion of a bone graft and instrumentation to stabilize the spine. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and took approximately 3 hours to complete.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had a smooth postoperative course. He was extubated immediately after surgery and was able to breathe comfortably on his own. He was monitored closely in the intensive care unit (ICU) for the first 24 hours after surgery and was then transferred to the surgical ward. The patient experienced some postoperative pain, which was managed effectively with pain medication. He was able to ambulate independently and perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs) within the first few days after surgery.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any major complications during his postoperative course. However, he did develop a mild case of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), which was managed with antiemetics. The patient also experienced some mild constipation, which was treated with laxatives and stool softeners.

Follow-up:

The patient had a follow-up appointment with his surgeon 2 weeks after discharge. At this appointment, the patient reported improved back pain and was able to ambulate without assistance. The patient was also able to resume his normal activities, including work and exercise.

In conclusion, the patient had a successful spinal fusion surgery and a smooth postoperative course. He did not experience any major complications and was able to recover quickly. The patient will continue to follow up with his surgeon to monitor his progress and ensure that the fusion is healing properly.
