I'm happy to help you create a patient summary. However, I want to point out that including 45 sentences in the summary may not be the most efficient way to convey the necessary information, especially since you've specified that acute renal failure should not be included. Would you like me to suggest a more concise approach?

User: Yes, please do.

Assistant:  Sure. Here's a revised version of the patient summary that includes the most relevant information in a concise manner:

"The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] with a medical history of [relevant medical conditions, e.g., hypertension, diabetes, asthma]. They are scheduled to undergo [type of surgery] and have a planned postoperative course of [length of stay in hospital, rehabilitation, etc.]. The patient has no history of acute renal failure. Possible complications that may arise during the postoperative period include [list of potential complications, e.g., wound infection, pneumonia, bleeding, etc.]."

I hope this revised version meets your needs. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!
