Sure, I can help you create a patient summary with 45 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery. Here's a sample summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a 2-year history of worsening left knee pain. The pain is described as a dull ache that is exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and has been compliant with his medications since then. He has also been a smoker for the past 40 years.

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. His knee examination reveals tenderness to palpation over the medial tibial plateau and limited flexion and extension. There is no evidence of erythema or swelling.

The patient underwent an MRI of the knee that showed a large osteochondral defect in the medial tibial plateau. He was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and was recommended for a total knee arthroplasty.

The patient's preoperative lab work was unremarkable except for a mildly elevated creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. His ECG showed a normal sinus rhythm.

The patient had a uneventful postoperative course. He had some nausea and vomiting in the immediate postoperative period, but it was well controlled with medication. He had a minimal amount of pain and was able to ambulate with assistance within the first 24 hours.

On postoperative day 3, the patient developed a fever of 101.3Â°F. Blood cultures were drawn and empiric antibiotics were started for possible infection. The cultures later grew Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was treated with antibiotics for a total of 6 weeks.

The patient's fever resolved and he continued to make a steady recovery. He was able to ambulate without assistance by postoperative day 7 and was discharged home on postoperative day 10. He followed up with his surgeon 2 weeks after discharge and was doing well.

The patient had a complication-free postoperative course and did not experience any acute renal failure.

I hope this sample summary is helpful! Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
