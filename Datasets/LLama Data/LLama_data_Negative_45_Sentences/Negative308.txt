Plan:

The patient is scheduled for lumbar fusion surgery to alleviate his chronic back pain and improve his quality of life. He will be closely monitored for his medical comorbidities during his postoperative course. He will also be referred to physical therapy to improve his mobility and strength after surgery.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. He was closely monitored in the intensive care unit for the first 24 hours and was then transferred to the general surgical floor. He was started on patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain management and had minimal nausea and vomiting.

He was able to ambulate and sit up in bed without any difficulty and had minimal pain. He was discharged home on postoperative day 4 with a prescription for hydrocodone and ibuprofen for pain management.
