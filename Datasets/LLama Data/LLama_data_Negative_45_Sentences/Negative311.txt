Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. The patient had a previous lumbar fusion surgery 10 years ago, which provided temporary relief but the pain has since returned. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief.

The patient is currently taking medication for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. He has no known allergies and has a negative history of bleeding disorders or prior surgeries. The patient is a current smoker but has been advised to quit smoking before surgery.

On physical examination, the patient has a limited range of motion in the lower back and left leg, with positive signs of radiculopathy. The patient's neurological examination is normal except for decreased sensation in the L5 dermatome.

Imaging studies, including an MRI, reveal a recurrent disc herniation at L4-L5, which is compressing the left L5 nerve root. The patient has been advised to undergo a revision lumbar fusion surgery to address the recurrent disc herniation.

The patient's postoperative course has been uncomplicated. He was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day and has been recovering well at home. The patient has been advised to follow a regular physical therapy program to improve his range of motion and strength in his lower back and left leg.

The patient had some minimal postoperative discomfort, which was managed with pain medication. He has not experienced any complications, such as infection, nerve damage, or blood clots. The patient has been advised to follow up with his surgeon in two weeks to assess his progress and remove sutures.

In conclusion, the patient has a history of chronic back pain and radiculopathy, which has been managed with conservative treatments. However, given the recurrent nature of the disc herniation, surgical intervention has been deemed necessary. The patient has undergone a revision lumbar fusion surgery and has had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He will continue to follow a regular physical therapy program to improve his function and minimize future recurrences.
