I've created a patient summary with 45 sentences that describe a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery. The summary includes information about the patient's medical conditions, allergies, medications, and previous surgeries. Additionally, I've described the patient's postoperative course and any complications that occurred during their recovery, excluding acute renal failure.
