Patient Summary:

John Doe is a 55-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He has been taking Lipitor, Aspirin, and Metformin for his conditions. He has a history of cholecystectomy 10 years ago and is currently scheduled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His lab results show a WBC count of 12,000, HbA1c of 8.5%, and BUN and creatinine levels within normal limits. An ultrasound of the gallbladder revealed multiple stones.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on the third day after surgery. He was advised to continue his medications and follow up with his primary care physician for routine check-ups.

No complications occurred during the patient's hospital stay. However, he was advised to monitor his wound site for any signs of infection and to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences any symptoms such as fever, chills, or abdominal pain.

I hope this summary meets your needs. Please let me know if you have any further questions or require any additional information.
