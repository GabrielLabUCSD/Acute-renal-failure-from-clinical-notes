Expected Postoperative Course:

* The patient will be admitted to the hospital for 2-3 days for observation and pain management.
* The patient will be placed on a breathing exercises and physical therapy regimen to help with lung expansion and prevent respiratory complications.
* The patient will be started on intravenous (IV) pain medication and will be transitioned to oral pain medication as needed.
* The patient will be monitored closely for signs of infection, bleeding, or other complications.
* The patient will be discharged home with a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks for suture removal and wound check.

Potential Complications:

* Blood clots or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Wound infection or sepsis
* Urinary retention or bladder dysfunction
* Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure
* Cardiac complications such as MI or arrhythmia
* Neurological complications such as stroke or seizure
* Renal complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression

Note: The patient's history of ESRD on hemodialysis may increase the risk of certain complications, such as AKI or infection. However, the patient's recent hemodialysis sessions have been uneventful, and the nephrologist has assured that the patient's renal function is stable.

I hope this patient summary helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
