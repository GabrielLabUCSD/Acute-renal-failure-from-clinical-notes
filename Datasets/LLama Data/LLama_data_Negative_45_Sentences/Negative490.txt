Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He was admitted for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones.

Preoperative evaluation revealed a notable history of smoking and alcohol consumption. The patient had a history of peptic ulcer disease and was taking aspirin and omeprazole. He also had a history of knee replacement surgery several years ago.

On admission, the patient's vital signs were normal, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 bpm. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10,000/mm3, hemoglobin A1C of 7.8%, and a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia without any complications. The procedure was performed uneventfully, and the patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit for recovery.

Postoperatively, the patient had a smooth course. He was able to take fluids and medications by mouth and had minimal nausea and discomfort. He was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day without any complications.
