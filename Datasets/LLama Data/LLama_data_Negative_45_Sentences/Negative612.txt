Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female, who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. She has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not experienced significant relief. Her MRI reveals a large L4-L5 disc herniation, which is likely causal to her symptoms. The patient is a suitable candidate for surgical intervention and will undergo a L4-L5 discectomy.

Preoperative Course:

The patient is in good health, with no major medical comorbidities. Her blood work and imaging studies are within normal limits. She has been counseled on the risks and benefits of surgery, and has provided informed consent. She has been optimized for surgery, which includes discontinuing certain medications and ensuring that her blood pressure is well-controlled.

Postoperative Course:

The patient had an uneventful surgery and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. She experienced minimal postoperative pain, which was managed effectively with pain medication. She was monitored closely for signs of neurological deficits, and her lower extremity strength and sensation remained intact. She was able to ambulate independently on the first postoperative day and was discharged home on postoperative day 2.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any significant complications during her postoperative course. However, she did develop a superficial wound infection, which was treated effectively with antibiotics and local wound care. She also reported mild numbness in her left anterior thigh, which resolved within a few weeks postoperatively.

Overall, the patient had a successful surgical outcome and experienced minimal complications during her postoperative course. Her chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy have improved significantly, and she has been able to resume her normal activities without any significant limitations.
