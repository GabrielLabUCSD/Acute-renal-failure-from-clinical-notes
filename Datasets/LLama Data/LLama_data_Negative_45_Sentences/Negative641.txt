Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He has been diagnosed with a lumbar herniated disc and spinal stenosis. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. He is now planning to undergo a lumbar decompression surgery.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he is currently taking medication to manage these conditions. He has no history of bleeding disorders or allergies. He is a non-smoker and drinks occasionally.

The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia, and the patient will be closely monitored for any signs of neurological compromise during the procedure.

The patient's postoperative course is expected to involve several days of hospitalization for observation and pain management. He will be encouraged to mobilize and perform deep breathing exercises to prevent respiratory complications.
