Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male, who presents with a history of chronic back pain, severe enough to limit his activities of daily living, and radiating to the left lower extremity. The patient has a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. The patient had a previous episode of severe back pain 5 years ago, for which he underwent physical therapy and medication without significant improvement.

The patient had been diagnosed with lumbar spondylolisthesis, L4-L5, and a central disc protrusion at L4-L5. The patient also has mild scoliosis. The patient was advised to undergo surgery, but he refused.

Four years ago, the patient started experiencing worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, including frequency, urgency, and nocturia. The patient was diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and was started on medication.

One year ago, the patient started experiencing worsening left knee pain, which limited his mobility. The patient was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the left knee and was started on medication.

Six months ago, the patient had a fall, resulting in a displaced subtrochanteric diaphyseal femur fracture. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation with a femoral nail. The patient had a complicated postoperative course with significant blood loss, requiring transfusion, and developed compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy. The patient also developed deep vein thrombosis and was started on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's hospital course was further complicated by a nosocomial infection, which was managed with antibiotics.

The patient's current medication list includes medications for pain, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anticoagulation. The patient's postoperative course has been uneventful, and the patient has been ambulating without assistance. The patient has been advised to continue with physical therapy and to follow up with his surgeon regularly.

The patient has no allergies and is fully informed of the risks and benefits of surgery. The patient's planned procedure is a lumbar spinal fusion, and the patient is scheduled to have the procedure within the next two weeks.

The patient's postoperative recovery is expected to be uneventful, and the patient will be closely monitored for any complications. The patient will require a period of immobilization and physical therapy to recover fully. The patient will also be required to follow up with his surgeon regularly to monitor the progress of the fusion and to address any issues that may arise.

The patient's risks for complications during surgery include bleeding, infection, and neurological injury. The patient's risk for bleeding is increased due to his history of bleeding complications during previous surgery. The patient's risk for infection is also increased due to his history of nosocomial infections. The patient's risk for neurological injury is minimized due to the use of modern surgical techniques and intraoperative monitoring.

The patient's postoperative care will include pain management with narcotics and non-narcotics. The patient will also be started on prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the risk of infection. The patient will require close monitoring of his vital signs, particularly his blood pressure, to ensure that it remains under control. The patient will also require close monitoring of his lower extremities for any signs of neurological compromise. The patient will be encouraged to ambulate early and to follow up with his surgeon regularly.

In summary, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic back pain, lumbar spondylolisthesis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and osteoarthritis of the left knee. The patient had a complicated postoperative course after a femoral fracture repair and requires close monitoring for any complications. The patient is planned to undergo a lumbar spinal fusion, and the postoperative recovery is expected to be uneventful. The patient's risks for complications during surgery include bleeding, infection, and neurological injury. The patient's postoperative care will include pain management, prophylactic antibiotics, close monitoring of
