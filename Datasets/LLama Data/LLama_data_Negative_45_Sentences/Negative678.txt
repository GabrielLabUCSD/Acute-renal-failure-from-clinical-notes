He also had some mild discomfort at the incision site, which was managed with pain medication. The patient did not develop any wound infections or other complications during his postoperative course.

Overall, the patient's surgery was a success, and he experienced significant improvement in his back pain and left leg radiculopathy. He will continue to follow up with his surgeon and physical therapist to ensure optimal recovery and function.
