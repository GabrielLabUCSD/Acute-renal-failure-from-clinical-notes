Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain. The pain started after a work-related injury five years ago and has been persistent since then. The patient has tried various treatments, including physical therapy and medications, but has not found significant relief.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and has been smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. He denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use.

On physical examination, the patient has a decreased range of motion in his back and bilateral lower extremities, with tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. His straight leg raise test is positive on both sides.

Imaging studies, including X-rays and MRI, reveal degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies show evidence of peripheral neuropathy.

The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medications, but has not achieved significant relief. Therefore, he is planning to undergo lumbar spine surgery.

Postoperative Course:

The patient underwent lumbar spine surgery, specifically a decompressive laminectomy and fusion. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient had a smooth intraoperative course.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced moderate pain, which was managed with opioid analgesics. He also had some nausea and vomiting, which were treated with antiemetics.

On the first postoperative day, the patient developed a fever, which was treated with antibiotics. He also had some respiratory issues, including tachypnea and hypoxia, which were managed with oxygen therapy.

The patient's pain improved gradually over the next few days, and he was able to ambulate with assistance. He was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day.

Complications:

The patient developed a wound infection at the incision site, which was treated with antibiotics. He also had some issues with constipation, which were managed with laxatives and stool softeners.

Follow-up:

The patient followed up with his surgeon one week after discharge, at which time his wound was noted to be healing well. He was advised to continue taking his pain medications and to gradually wean himself off them over time.

At the two-week follow-up, the patient reported some continued pain and discomfort, but was able to ambulate without assistance. His surgeon recommended that he continue with physical therapy to improve his range of motion and strength.

At the six-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in his pain and function. He was able to return to work at that time.

There were no further complications noted during the postoperative course.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this patient underwent lumbar spine surgery for degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. He had a successful surgery and postoperative course, with minor complications that were effectively managed. The patient was able to return to work at six weeks postoperatively and had significant improvement in his pain and function.
