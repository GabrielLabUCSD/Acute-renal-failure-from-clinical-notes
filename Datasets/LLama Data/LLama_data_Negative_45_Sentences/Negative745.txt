Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male, who presents with a history of chronic back pain and numbness in his lower extremities. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, but has not achieved adequate relief. Imaging studies reveal spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, and the patient has been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to address these issues. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has a history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He denies any significant allergies or adverse reactions to medication.

Preoperative lab results show normal liver and renal function, and the patient has a normal echocardiogram. He has a history of sleep apnea and will be monitored closely postoperatively for signs of respiratory compromise.

The patient undergoes successful lumbar fusion surgery, and his immediate postoperative course is uncomplicated. He experiences some expected postoperative pain and discomfort, which is well-controlled with medication. He is encouraged to ambulate early and often to minimize the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

On postoperative day 2, the patient develops a fever and tachycardia. He is evaluated with a chest x-ray and blood cultures, which are negative. He is diagnosed with a mild postoperative infection and is started on antibiotics.

The patient continues to recover and is discharged home on postoperative day 5. At his 2-week follow-up appointment, he reports minimal pain and is ambulating without difficulty. He is advised to continue his antibiotics and to follow-up with his primary care physician for further management of his infection.

At his 6-week follow-up appointment, the patient reports that his pain has significantly improved, and he is able to resume his normal activities. Imaging studies show successful fusion, and the patient is satisfied with the outcome of his surgery.

Throughout his postoperative course, the patient is closely monitored for his chronic medical conditions, and his medication regimen is adjusted as needed. He is encouraged to continue with physical therapy to optimize his function and minimize the risk of future complications.

Overall, the patient experiences a successful outcome from his surgery and is able to resume his normal activities with minimal pain. His postoperative course is complicated by a mild infection, but this is effectively managed with antibiotics, and he does not experience any other complications during his recovery.
