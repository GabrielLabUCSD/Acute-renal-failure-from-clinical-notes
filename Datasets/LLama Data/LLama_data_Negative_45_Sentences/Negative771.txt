Patient Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and sciatica. The pain started after a work-related injury 10 years ago and has been gradually worsening over time. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medications, but has not experienced significant relief.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. They have also been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, and herniated discs.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to address the underlying causes of their back pain. The surgery will involve the insertion of a metal rod and screws to stabilize the spine and promote fusion of the affected vertebrae.

Postoperative Course:

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with minimal pain and discomfort. They were able to ambulate independently within the first 24 hours after surgery and were discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day.

The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for the first 6 weeks after surgery. They were also prescribed a regimen of pain medications and muscle relaxants to manage any discomfort or spasms.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after surgery to monitor the patient's progress and check for any complications.

Complications:

The patient did not experience any significant complications during their postoperative course. They reported some minor discomfort and swelling at the incision site, which resolved within the first week after surgery.

The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia were well-managed during the postoperative period, with no signs of exacerbation or decompensation.

The patient's smoking history was a concern, as it can impede the healing process and increase the risk of postoperative complications. However, the patient was advised to abstain from smoking for at least 6 weeks before and after surgery, and they reported minimal cravings or difficulties with nicotine withdrawal.

Overall, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and they were able to recover successfully from their lumbar fusion surgery without any significant complications.
