I understand that you need a patient summary with 45 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery. Here's a possible summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and limited mobility. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, but has not experienced significant relief. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, which are well-controlled with medication. He has no history of cardiovascular disease or respiratory problems.

The patient underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation, which included laboratory tests, imaging studies, and a cardiological assessment. All results were within normal limits. The patient was cleared for surgery by his primary care physician and anesthesiologist.

The patient underwent a lumbar spinal fusion surgery, which was performed under general anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient recovered well. He was extubated immediately after surgery and remained stable in the recovery room.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He experienced some discomfort and pain, which was managed effectively with pain medication. He was able to ambulate and sit comfortably without any difficulty. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day, and he reported significant improvement in his back pain and mobility.

The patient had no complications during his hospital stay or after discharge. He followed up with his surgeon and primary care physician regularly and reported continued improvement in his symptoms. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and returned to his normal activities.

I hope this summary meets your requirements. Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
