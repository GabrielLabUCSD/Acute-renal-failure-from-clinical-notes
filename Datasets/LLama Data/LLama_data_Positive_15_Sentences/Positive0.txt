Patient Summary:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male.
2. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
3. He had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) 10 years ago and has been managed with medication.
4. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and uses an inhaler as needed.
5. He has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and takes metformin.
6. He has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3.
7. He has been scheduled for elective surgery (knee replacement).
8. Pre-operative lab results show an elevated creatinine level (1.8 mg/dL) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 mL/min/1.73m2.
9. Urinalysis shows trace protein and blood.
10. The patient has been informed of the risks and benefits of surgery and has provided informed consent.
11. The patient has been optimized for surgery, including holding anti-platelet medications and adjusting diabetic medications.
12. Intra-operatively, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) as evidenced by a rise in creatinine to 2.5 mg/dL and oliguria.
13. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.
14. The patient was managed with fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and hemodialysis.
15. The patient had a prolonged hospital course but ultimately recovered and was discharged home with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and an eGFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m2.

Complication: Acute Renal Failure (ARF)

1. The patient developed ARF post-operatively, likely due to a combination of pre-existing CKD, hypotension, and sepsis.
2. The patient's creatinine level rose from 1.8 mg/dL pre-operatively to 2.5 mg/dL intra-operatively.
3. Oliguria was also noted, with a urine output of less than 100 mL/hr.
4. The patient required fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and hemodialysis to manage ARF.
5. The patient's renal function improved over time, with a discharge creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and an eGFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m2.
