Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient is a candidate for lumbar fusion surgery to address his chronic pain and improve his quality of life.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will need to be carefully managed during the perioperative period. He is currently taking several medications, including aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin, and will need to hold these medications perioperatively as directed by his surgeon.

The patient has a history of smoking, but quit 10 years ago. He has a history of moderate alcohol use, but has abstained from alcohol for the past month in preparation for surgery.

The patient has a history of kidney stones and has been advised to stay well-hydrated to help prevent future stones. He has also been advised to avoid certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which may exacerbate kidney problems.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillin and cephalosporins, and will need to be monitored closely for any signs of an allergic reaction during surgery.

The patient has a history of bleeding disorders and will need to be carefully monitored for any signs of bleeding or coagulopathy during surgery.

The patient has a history of previous abdominal surgery, which may increase the risk of complications during the current surgery.

The patient is currently taking warfarin, which will need to be carefully managed during the perioperative period to avoid bleeding complications.

The patient has a history of sleep apnea and will need to be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory compromise during surgery.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and will need to be carefully managed during the perioperative period to avoid any complications related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and will need to be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory compromise during surgery.

The patient has a history of previous cardiovascular disease, including a myocardial infarction, and will need to be carefully monitored for any signs of cardiac complications during surgery.

The patient has a history of previous stroke and will need to be carefully monitored for any signs of neurological complications during surgery.

The patient is planning to have a lumbar fusion surgery, which carries risks such as infection, nerve damage, and blood clots.

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which is a common complication in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. The patient will need to be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and may require dialysis if the renal failure persists.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of respiratory compromise, as sleep apnea and COPD increase the risk of respiratory complications during surgery.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of cardiac complications, as previous cardiovascular disease increases the risk of cardiac events during surgery.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of neurological complications, as previous stroke increases the risk of neurological events during surgery.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of infection, as the surgical site is at risk for infection.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of nerve damage, as nerve damage is a common complication of lumbar fusion surgery.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of blood clots, as immobility during surgery increases the risk of blood clots.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, as acute renal failure increases the risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of
