Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has been smoking for the past 40 years and has a history of alcohol abuse. The patient has been experiencing worsening left knee pain for the past year, which has limited his mobility and affected his quality of life. He has tried physical therapy and medication but has not experienced significant relief. The patient is scheduled to undergo a total knee replacement surgery.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He has no known allergies and is currently taking aspirin, metformin, and atorvastatin. The patient's lab results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. The patient's urine output has been decreasing, and he has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and confusion. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he has developed edema in his lower extremities.

The patient's surgical risk factors include his age, smoking history, and comorbidities. The patient's acute renal failure increases his risk of complications during and after surgery. The patient's surgeon and anesthesiologist will need to closely monitor his renal function and fluid management during the procedure. The patient will also require close monitoring in the postoperative period to ensure that his renal function improves and that he does not develop further complications.

In conclusion, the patient's medical history and current condition indicate that he is at risk for complications during and after surgery. It is essential that the patient's surgical team is aware of his medical history, current condition, and potential risks to ensure a successful outcome. Close monitoring and management of the patient's renal function and fluid status will be critical in minimizing the risk of complications.
