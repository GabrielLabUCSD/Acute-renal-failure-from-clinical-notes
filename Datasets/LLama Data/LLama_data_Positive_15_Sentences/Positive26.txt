Complication:

Unfortunately, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) postoperatively. The patient's serum creatinine level increased to 2.5 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.8 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed pyuria and hematuria. A renal ultrasound revealed hydronephrosis and decreased renal function. The patient was diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and started on intravenous fluids and vasopressors. The patient's renal function improved within 72 hours, and he was discharged from the hospital with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and instructions to follow up with his nephrologist.
