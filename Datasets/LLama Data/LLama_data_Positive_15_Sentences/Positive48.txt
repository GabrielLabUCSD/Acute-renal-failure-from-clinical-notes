Complication:

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) due to perioperative hypotension and sepsis. He required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and was treated with vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. The patient's renal function gradually improved with supportive care and he was able to recover fully within a week. However, he required prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation to regain his strength and mobility.

This patient summary provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's medical history, including his chronic medical conditions, medications, and previous surgeries. It also highlights the potential risks and complications associated with surgery, such as acute renal failure, which can be a life-threatening complication. This information is essential for the surgical team to make informed decisions about the patient's care and to ensure a smooth and successful surgical outcome.
