Complication:

After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was caused by a combination of factors, including pre-existing chronic kidney disease, hypovolemia, and the use of certain medications during surgery. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and treatment. The patient required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to support his kidney function and was closely monitored for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance. He remained in the ICU for several days until his renal function improved, and he was able to be transferred back to the surgical ward for further recovery.
