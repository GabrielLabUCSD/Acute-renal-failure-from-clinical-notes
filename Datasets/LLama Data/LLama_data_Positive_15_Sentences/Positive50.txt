Complication:

1. Acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to complicated surgery.

The patient"s surgery was complicated by ARF, which is a common complication in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. The patient"s age, history of CKD, and sepsis secondary to the surgical site infection all contributed to the development of ARF. The patient"s urine output and serum creatinine levels have been closely monitored, and he has been receiving appropriate fluid and medication management to support his kidney function. The patient"s respiratory status has also been closely monitored, and he has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing. The patient"s family has been informed of his condition and are present at the bedside to provide emotional support.
