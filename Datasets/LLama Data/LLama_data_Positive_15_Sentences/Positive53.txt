15. He is admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and management of his acute renal failure.

Complication:

1. The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) post-surgery, which was caused by a combination of factors such as dehydration, sepsis, and medication-related nephrotoxicity.
2. The patient's serum creatinine level increased from 1.8 mg/dL pre-operatively to 4.5 mg/dL on the first post-operative day.
3. The patient's urine output decreased significantly, and he developed oliguria.
4. The patient's blood work revealed an elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating worsening renal function.
5. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and diuretics to help improve renal function and urine output.
6. The patient's urine output and renal function slowly improved over the next few days, and he was eventually weaned off the diuretics.
7. The patient was closely monitored for signs of fluid overload, and his fluid intake was restricted to avoid worsening his renal function.
8. The patient's renal function returned to normal within a week, and he was discharged from the hospital with plans for close follow-up with his nephrologist.
