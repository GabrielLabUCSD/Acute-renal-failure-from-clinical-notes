Patient Summary:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male.
2. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.
3. He has been smoking for the past 40 years.
4. He has a history of coronary artery disease and had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago.
5. He has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
6. He has been taking aspirin, metformin, and atorvastatin for his medical conditions.
7. He has a history of chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL.
8. He recently underwent a surgical procedure for the removal of a benign tumor in his colon.
9. After the surgery, he developed acute renal failure (ARF) and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
10. His postoperative creatinine level increased to 4.5 mg/dL.
11. Urinalysis showed pyuria and hematuria.
12. Blood cultures were positive for E. coli.
13. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and underwent hemodialysis for ARF.
14. His urine output and renal function improved gradually over the next few days.
15. He was transferred out of the ICU and is currently recovering on the surgical ward.

Complication: Acute Renal Failure (ARF)

The patient developed ARF after surgery, which was likely caused by a combination of factors, including prerenal azotemia due to dehydration and sepsis-induced acute tubular necrosis. The patient's pre-existing chronic kidney disease and advanced age also contributed to the development of ARF. The patient required hemodialysis and broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage the complication. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid management are crucial to prevent further complications and optimizing recovery.
