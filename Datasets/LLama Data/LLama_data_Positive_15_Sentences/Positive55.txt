Acute Renal Failure Complication:

After the surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure, which was likely caused by a combination of factors including sepsis, hypotension, and fluid overload. He required vasopressors to maintain his blood pressure and was started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to help remove waste products from his blood. He also developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. The patient remained in the intensive care unit for several days and had a prolonged hospital stay due to his complications.
