Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and mobility issues. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief. The patient is a candidate for spinal fusion surgery to address his chronic pain and improve his quality of life.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will need to be carefully managed during the perioperative period. He has no known allergies and is not taking any medications that may interfere with anesthesia.

The patient is a former smoker and has a history of alcohol use disorder, but he has been sober for the past five years. He has a supportive family and social network, which will be beneficial during his recovery.

The patient is slightly overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. He has been advised to lose weight before surgery to reduce the risk of complications.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair, both of which were uneventful.

The patient's family history includes a first-degree relative with a history of coronary artery disease.

The patient's current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and omeprazole.

The patient has been advised to stop taking his medications, except for his anti-hypertensive medications, 24 hours before surgery.

The patient will require blood transfusions during surgery, as he has a low hemoglobin level.

The patient will also require close monitoring of his blood pressure and pulse oximetry during surgery, given his history of hypertension and the risk of perioperative complications.

The patient understands the risks and benefits of the surgery and has provided informed consent.

Acute Renal Failure Complication:

Post-surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was diagnosed based on elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

The patient was managed with conservative treatment, including fluid management and medications to support renal function.

The patient required several sessions of hemodialysis to maintain adequate renal function.

The patient's renal function slowly improved over time, and he was able to discontinue hemodialysis after two weeks.

The patient's recovery was prolonged, and he required an extended hospital stay for further management and monitoring.

The patient was closely monitored for signs of fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and other potential complications.

The patient received intensive physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and prevent respiratory complications.

The patient's family was involved in his care and provided emotional support during this challenging period.

The patient's recovery was successful, and he was able to return home after a six-week hospital stay.

The patient will require close follow-up with his primary care physician and nephrologist to monitor his renal function and prevent future complications.

The patient will also need to continue with lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, to maintain his overall health and well-being.
