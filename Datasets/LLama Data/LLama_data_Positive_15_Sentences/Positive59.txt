Complications:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient developed acute renal failure post-surgery, which is a common complication in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.
2. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient experienced fluid and electrolyte imbalance due to the acute renal failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Dialysis dependence: The patient requires dialysis to maintain his renal function, which can be a life-long requirement if his renal function does not improve.
4. Surgical postponement: The patient's surgery has been postponed due to his acute renal failure, which can impact his quality of life and mobility.
5. Increased risk of infections: The patient is at an increased risk of infections due to his immunosuppressed state from the dialysis and surgery, which can further complicate his condition.
