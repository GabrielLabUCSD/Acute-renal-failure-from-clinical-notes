Sure, here's a sample patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery, as well as a description of the patient experiencing acute renal failure complication after surgery:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease.
2. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and pain medication, but has not experienced significant relief.
3. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which will need to be controlled perioperatively.
4. He has a history of smoking, but quit 10 years ago.
5. The patient has no known allergies to medications or anesthesia.
6. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and takes medication for it.
7. The patient has a history of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and uses an inhaler as needed.
8. He has a history of mild sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night.
9. The patient has a history of peripheral neuropathy in his feet, which may affect his ability to ambulate postoperatively.
10. He has a history of previous abdominal surgery, which may increase the risk of complications during the current surgery.
11. The patient has a history of bleeding disorders and takes medication to control it.
12. He has a history of liver disease and will need close monitoring of liver function during the perioperative period.
13. The patient has a history of kidney disease and will need close monitoring of renal function during the perioperative period.
14. He has a history of heart disease and takes medication for it.
15. The patient is planning to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to address his chronic back pain.

Complication:

1. The patient developed acute renal failure postoperatively, which was likely due to a combination of factors, including hypotension, sepsis, and medication-induced nephrotoxicity.
2. The patient's creatinine levels increased significantly from 1.5 mg/dL preoperatively to 4.5 mg/dL on postoperative day 2.
3. The patient's urine output decreased significantly, and he required fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
4. The patient developed electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia, which required careful management.
5. The patient's acute renal failure was treated with supportive care, including fluid management, medication adjustments, and close monitoring of renal function.
6. The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next few days, and he was able to recover fully from the complication.
7. The patient's surgical wound healed uneventfully, and he was able to return home without any further complications.

This patient summary provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's medical history, including his chronic conditions, medications, and previous surgeries, which will help guide the perioperative care plan. The description of the acute renal failure complication highlights the importance of close monitoring of renal function during the perioperative period, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.
