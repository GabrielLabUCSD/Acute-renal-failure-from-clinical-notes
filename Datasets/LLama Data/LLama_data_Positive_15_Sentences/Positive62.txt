Sure, here's a sample patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history and acute renal failure complication after surgery:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and decreased mobility.
2. He has tried various conservative treatments, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief.
3. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled with medication.

5. The patient has no known allergies and has not had any previous surgeries.
6. He is currently taking aspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin.
7. The patient has been fasting for 8 hours prior to surgery and has had nothing to eat or drink since midnight.
8. His last meal was a light breakfast consisting of toast and juice.
9. The patient has no history of bleeding disorders or previous episodes of bleeding.
10. He has a history of easy bruising, but this has not been a concern for him in the past.

14. He has a history of renal calculi and has had a previous episode of acute renal failure during a hospitalization for a urinary tract infection.
15. The patient's blood work shows elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and a decreased eGFR, consistent with acute renal failure.

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was managed with supportive care, including fluid management and medications to help support his kidney function. The patient's renal function gradually improved, and he was able to recover fully. However, the patient will need to be closely monitored for any future decline in renal function and will require ongoing management and follow-up with his primary care physician and nephrologist.
