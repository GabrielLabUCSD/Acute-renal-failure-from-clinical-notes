Acute Renal Failure Complication:

After surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure, which was likely triggered by a combination of factors, including sepsis, hypotension, and the use of certain medications. The patient developed oliguria and his serum creatinine levels increased significantly. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management. The patient required hemodialysis and fluid management to help stabilize his renal function and electrolyte levels. He remained in the ICU for several days before being transferred back to a regular hospital room for ongoing care and recovery. The patient required ongoing renal support and monitoring to ensure his renal function recovered fully.
