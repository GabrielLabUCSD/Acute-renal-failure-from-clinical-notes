Postoperative Course:

The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) on the first postoperative day (POD1) with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a urine output of 30 mL/hr. He was started on intravenous fluids and medications to support his kidney function. He was closely monitored and his renal function gradually improved over the next few days. He was able to tolerate oral intake and his pain was well-controlled with medication. He was discharged from the hospital on POD5.

Follow-up:

The patient had a follow-up appointment with his surgeon 2 weeks after discharge. His wound was healing well and he was able to ambulate with assistance. His creatinine level had improved to 3.5 mg/dL and his urine output was 50 mL/hr.
