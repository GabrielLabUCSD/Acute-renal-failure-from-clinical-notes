Sure, here's a sample patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery, as well as a description of the patient experiencing acute renal failure complication after surgery:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.
2. He has been smoking for the past 40 years and has a history of alcohol abuse.
3. He has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the past.
4. He has also been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been hospitalized several times for exacerbations.
5. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and has been taking proton pump inhibitors for several years.
6. He has a history of osteoarthritis and has undergone total knee replacement surgery.
7. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and has been taking medication for symptomatic relief.
8. He has a history of hypothyroidism and has been taking levothyroxine for several years.

12. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has been followed by a nephrologist.
13. His kidney function has been stable over the past year, with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL.
14. He has been scheduled for elective surgery, specifically a total hip replacement.
15. Given his history of CKD, the anesthesiologist has recommended that he undergoes creatinine clearance testing before surgery to ensure that his kidneys can handle the anesthesia and surgical stress.

Complication:

1. After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) and required intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
2. His creatinine level increased to 4.5 mg/dL and he required hemodialysis.
3. The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was started on antibiotics.
4. He also developed seizures and was started on anticonvulsants.
5. The patient remained in the ICU for 1 week and was gradually weaned off dialysis.
6. His creatinine level decreased to 2.5 mg/dL and he was discharged from the hospital.
7. He will require close follow-up with his nephrologist to monitor his kidney function and prevent future ARF episodes.
