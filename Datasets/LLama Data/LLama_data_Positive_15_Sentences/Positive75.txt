Complication:

After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was detected by a rise in serum creatinine level and a decrease in urine output. The patient was volume-depleted and had signs of decreased perfusion to the kidneys. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and was started on intravenous fluids and medications to help improve renal function. The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next few days, and he was able to recover fully without the need for dialysis.
