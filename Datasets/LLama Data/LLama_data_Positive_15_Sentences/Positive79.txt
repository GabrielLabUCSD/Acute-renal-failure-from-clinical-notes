Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He has a history of smoking and has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The patient has been experiencing worsening left knee pain and diffuse arthritis for the past year, which has limited his mobility and ability to perform daily activities. He has tried physical therapy and steroid injections without significant improvement.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a total knee replacement surgery. Pre-operative lab work revealed elevated liver enzymes, which were subsequently diagnosed as alcohol-related liver disease. The patient has been advised to abstain from alcohol for at least 4 weeks prior to surgery.

The patient has a history of non-adherence to medications and has not been compliant with his medication regimen in the past. He has been counseled on the importance of adherence to his medications post-operatively to ensure proper wound healing and prevention of infection.

The patient has a supportive family network, including a spouse and adult children who are actively involved in his care.

Post-operative care plan includes aggressive physical therapy, pain management, and wound care. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of complications such as infection, bleeding, or thromboembolism.

Complications:

Two days post-operatively, the patient developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis. He presented with decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine, and metabolic acidosis. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and aggressive fluid management.

The patient's renal failure was managed with hemodialysis, and he showed improvement in renal function over the next few days. However, he developed a pericardial effusion, likely related to the sepsis, which required drainage.

The patient remained in the hospital for a prolonged period, requiring extended antibiotic therapy and wound care. He eventually made a full recovery and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up appointments.

The patient's acute renal failure was a significant complication that prolonged his recovery and required aggressive intervention. His non-adherence to medications and history of substance abuse were risk factors for this complication.

The patient's case highlights the importance of careful pre-operative assessment, close post-operative monitoring, and aggressive management of complications. It also underscores the need for patients to be compliant with their medications and follow post-operative instructions closely to prevent avoidable complications.
