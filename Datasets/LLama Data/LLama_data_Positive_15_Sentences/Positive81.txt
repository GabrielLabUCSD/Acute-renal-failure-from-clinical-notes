Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He has been having chronic back pain for the past 10 years and has tried various conservative treatments without significant relief. He is now planning to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery to alleviate his pain. The patient has a history of smoking and has been advised to quit smoking before the surgery. He is also taking several medications, including blood thinners, and has been advised to hold these medications before the surgery as per the surgeon's instructions. The patient had a previous history of acute renal failure 5 years ago and has been monitored regularly by a nephrologist. His latest creatinine level was 1.8mg/dL. The patient is aware of the risks and benefits of the surgery and has been counseled about the possibility of postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and respiratory problems. He has also been informed about the potential need for blood transfusion during the surgery. The patient has a supportive family member who will be able to assist him during his postoperative care.

Complication:

Postoperatively, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) which was diagnosed by the surgical team after monitoring his urine output and blood work. The patient's creatinine level increased to 3mg/dL and his urine output decreased significantly. The patient was immediately started on vasopressors and fluid resuscitation to manage his hypotension and hypovolemia. The surgical team consulted with a nephrologist and the patient was initiated on hemodialysis to assist with his renal recovery. The patient remained in the intensive care unit for close monitoring and was monitored closely by the surgical and nephrology teams. The patient's renal function gradually improved over the next few days and he was eventually weaned off hemodialysis and transitioned to oral medications to manage his kidney function.

This patient summary outlines the medical history and planning for a patient undergoing lumbar fusion surgery, as well as a potential complication of acute renal failure that may arise postoperatively. It provides essential information for healthcare providers to make informed decisions about the patient's care and to ensure close monitoring and management of potential complications.
