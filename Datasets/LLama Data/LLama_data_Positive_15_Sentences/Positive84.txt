Sure, here's a sample patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history and acute renal failure complication after surgery:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and degenerative disc disease.
2. He has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without significant relief.
3. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and is currently taking medications for these conditions.
4. He has no history of bleeding disorders or allergies to anesthesia.
5. The patient has a history of smoking, but has abstained for the past 5 years.
6. He consumes moderate amounts of alcohol, but denies any recent binge drinking.
7. The patient has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night.
8. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL.
9. The patient has been relatively stable, with no significant changes in his renal function over the past year.
10. He has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, with a HbA1c of 7.5%.
11. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 35, classifying him as obese.
12. He has no history of previous surgeries or anesthesia complications.
13. The patient is currently taking aspirin and ibuprofen for pain management.
14. He has been advised to stop taking these medications 7 days prior to surgery.
15. The patient is scheduled to undergo a lumbar fusion surgery, and the surgeon has recommended close monitoring of his renal function during the perioperative period.

Complication:

1. Acute renal failure (ARF) developed postoperatively, with a rise in creatinine level to 2.5 mg/dL and a decrease in urine output.
2. The patient experienced decreased urine output, with only 200 mL of urine produced in the first 8 hours after surgery.
3. He complained of decreased urge to void, and had a significantly decreased level of consciousness.
4. The patient had signs of volume overload, with jugular venous distension and pedal edema.
5. Urgent ultrasonography revealed bilateral hydronephrosis, suggesting an obstruction in the urinary tract.
6. The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure due to bilateral ureteral obstruction, likely caused by the surgical retractors used during the lumbar fusion procedure.
7. The patient was immediately taken back to the operating room for revision of the surgery, with successful removal of the retractors and relief of the obstruction.
8. The patient's renal function began to improve, with a gradual decrease in creatinine level and increase in urine output over the next 24 hours.
9. He was closely monitored in the intensive care unit for the next 48 hours, with continued improvement in his renal function.
10. The patient was eventually transferred to the ward and made a full recovery, with no long-term sequelae.
