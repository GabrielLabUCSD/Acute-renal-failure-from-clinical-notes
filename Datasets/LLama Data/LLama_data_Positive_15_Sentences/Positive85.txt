Sure, here's a patient summary with 15 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery, as well as a description of the patient experiencing acute renal failure as a complication after surgery:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and limited mobility.
2. He has been smoking for the past 40 years and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
3. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication regularly.
4. He has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes metformin for blood sugar control.
5. The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and takes proton pump inhibitors for symptom control.
6. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III and has been advised to follow a low-protein diet.
7. The patient has a history of prostate cancer, for which he underwent radiation therapy 10 years ago.
8. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and takes tamsulosin for symptom control.
9. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat a blocked coronary artery.
10. He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine for symptom control.
11. The patient is allergic to penicillin and sulfa medications.
12. He has a history of bleeding disorders and takes warfarin for blood thinning.
13. The patient is scheduled to undergo a total knee replacement surgery to address his chronic knee pain.
14. The patient's blood work reveals an elevated creatinine level, indicating acute renal failure, after the surgery.
15. The patient's urine output is monitored closely, and he is started on intravenous furosemide to help improve his renal function.

Complication: Acute renal failure

The patient's history of CKD and exposure to contrast dye during the PCI procedure may have contributed to the development of acute renal failure after surgery. The patient's urine output and renal function will be closely monitored, and he will be started on intravenous furosemide to help improve his renal function. The patient will also be advised to follow a low-protein diet and to monitor his fluid intake to help manage his chronic kidney disease.
