Patient Summary:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old male.
2. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
3. The patient had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and has been manageing it with medication.
4. The patient has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. The patient has been experiencing worsening left knee pain over the past year.
6. The patient was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis of the left knee.
7. The patient's pain has been managed with physical therapy, analgesics, and corticosteroid injections.
8. However, the patient's pain has persisted and surgical intervention is being considered.
9. The patient's BMI is 32, which increases the risk of complications during surgery.
10. The patient has a history of asthma, which may increase the risk of respiratory complications during anesthesia.
11. The patient has a history of allergic reactions to penicillin.
12. The patient is currently taking aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and tramadol.
13. The patient has been advised to stop taking aspirin and lisinopril 7 days before surgery.
14. The patient had a recent episode of acute renal failure due to sever hydration and AKI.
15. The patient's kidney function has improved but will need close monitoring during surgery.

Acute Renal Failure Complication:

1. The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) postoperatively.
2. The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.5mg/dL preoperatively to 4.5mg/dL on the first postoperative day.
3. The patient's urine output decreased significantly, and they had elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
4. The patient's ARF was likely caused by a combination of factors, including prerenal azotemia due to dehydration, intrinsic renal damage from the surgery, and possible sepsis.
5. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and diuretics to manage fluid balance and improve renal function.
6. The patient's urine output and creatinine level improved over the next few days, but the patient required continued close monitoring and supportive care.
7. The patient developed a urinary tract infection, which further complicated their recovery.
8. The patient required prolonged hospitalization and intensive care unit admission to manage their ARF and related complications.
9. Close monitoring of the patient's renal function and fluid balance was crucial in preventing further complications and ensuring a successful recovery.
10. The patient's ARF was a serious complication that required prompt and appropriate management to prevent long-term renal damage and other complications.
