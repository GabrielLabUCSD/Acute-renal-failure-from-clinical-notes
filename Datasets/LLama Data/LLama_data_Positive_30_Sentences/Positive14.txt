Complication: Acute renal failure

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was diagnosed based on elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and fluid management. He was started on intravenous fluids and medications to support his kidney function. The patient's urine output and creatinine levels were closely monitored, and he was eventually able to recover his kidney function fully. The patient was discharged home with close follow-up appointments with his nephrologist and primary care physician to monitor his kidney function and prevent any future complications.
