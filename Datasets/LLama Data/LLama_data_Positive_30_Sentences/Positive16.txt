Complication: Acute renal failure

The patient developed acute renal failure postoperatively, likely due to a combination of factors such as hypovolemia, sepsis, and medication-induced nephrotoxicity. He experienced a sudden drop in urine output, elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and required temporary hemodialysis to correct his fluid and electrolyte imbalance. The patient received intensive care unit admission and close monitoring of his renal function, fluid status, and electrolyte levels. He was also managed with conservative measures such as fluid resuscitation, medication adjustments, and supportive care to help his kidneys recover. The patient's renal function gradually improved over time, and he was able to avoid long-term dialysis dependence.
