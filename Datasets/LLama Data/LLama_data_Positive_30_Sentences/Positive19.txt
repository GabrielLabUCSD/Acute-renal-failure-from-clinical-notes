Complication: Acute renal failure

The patient developed acute renal failure after surgery due to a combination of factors, including hypovolemia, sepsis, and medication-induced nephrotoxicity. He experienced decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine levels, and metabolic acidosis. The patient required fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and supportive care to manage the acute renal failure. He remained in the intensive care unit for close monitoring and eventually made a full recovery.
