Complication: Acute Renal Failure

The patient experienced acute renal failure following his parathyroidectomy surgery. This complication is likely due to the patient's pre-existing medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and a history of urinary tract infections. The patient's renal failure was further complicated by the need for blood transfusions and the use of diuretics and intravenous fluids for fluid management. The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit for signs of seizure activity and was prescribed antibiotics for a suspected urinary tract infection. The patient was referred to a nephrologist for further management of his renal failure and was recommended to undergo hemodialysis. The patient is currently awaiting a kidney transplant.
