Acute Renal Failure Complication:

The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) postoperatively, which was diagnosed by an increase in serum creatinine level and a decrease in urine output. The patient had a baseline creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, which increased to 4.5 mg/dL on postoperative day 2. The patient's urine output decreased from 100 mL/hour to 30 mL/hour on postoperative day 3. The patient was fluid-resuscitated with IV fluids, and his urine output increased to 80 mL/hour. The patient's creatinine level improved to 3.5 mg/dL on postoperative day 5. The patient was monitored closely for any signs of fluid overload, and his IV fluids were adjusted accordingly. The patient's renal function continued to improve, and he was discharged home on postoperative day
