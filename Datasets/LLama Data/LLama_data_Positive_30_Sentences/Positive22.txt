As for the complication of acute renal failure, it is a condition that can occur after surgery, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those who are at risk for kidney damage. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension may increase their risk for acute renal failure after surgery. Additionally, the patient's history of previous renal failure may also increase their risk for future episodes of renal failure. Therefore, it is important for the patient to be closely monitored for signs of renal failure after surgery, and for the healthcare team to take steps to prevent and manage this complication should it occur.
