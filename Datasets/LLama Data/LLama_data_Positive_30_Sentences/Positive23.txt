After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, with elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and a decrease in urine output. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and management. The patient's urine output and fluid balance were closely monitored, and he was started on furosemide and hydralazine to help improve his renal function. He also received broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis. His renal function slowly improved over the next few days, and he was eventually able to be discharged from the hospital. However, he was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and nephrologist for further management of his chronic kidney disease.

This sample patient summary highlights the importance of preoperative evaluation and management of medical conditions, particularly those that may affect the patient's perioperative course, such as renal disease. It also emphasizes the need for close monitoring and management of postoperative complications, such as acute renal failure, to ensure optimal patient outcomes.
