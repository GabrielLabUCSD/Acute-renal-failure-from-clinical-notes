Complication:
After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was detected by an increase in his serum creatinine level and a decrease in his urine output. He was diagnosed with acute kidney injury and was started on dialysis. The patient had to undergo an emergency nephrostomy tube placement to help remove excess fluid and improve his kidney function. He had a prolonged hospital stay and required several weeks of dialysis before his kidney function improved.
