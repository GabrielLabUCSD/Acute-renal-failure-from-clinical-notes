Complication: Acute renal failure

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) due to a combination of factors, including prerenal azotemia from hypovolemia and sepsis. The patient required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and hemodialysis. The patient's renal function improved over time, and the patient was eventually able to be discharged home with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL.
