Complication: 

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) due to a combination of factors, including sepsis, hypotension, and perioperative blood loss. The patient required intensive care unit admission and hemodialysis. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay and required a gradual weaning off dialysis before being discharged home with a follow-up appointment with a nephrologist.

Please note that this patient summary is a fictional example and does not represent any real patient's medical history.
