Complication:

After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) due to a combination of factors such as pre-existing chronic kidney disease, perioperative hypotension, and sepsis. The patient's creatinine level increased to 4.5mg/dL, and he required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for 5 days. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay and required intensive care unit admission for close monitoring. He was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation and further management of his renal failure.

This patient summary provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's medical history, current health status, and risk factors, which is essential for anesthesiologists, surgeons, and other healthcare providers involved in the patient's care to make informed decisions and provide optimal care. The complication of acute renal failure after surgery highlights the importance of close monitoring and management of patients with pre-existing renal impairment and multiple comorbidities during the perioperative period.
