Acute renal failure (ARF) is a sudden and often reversible decrease in renal function that can occur after surgery, particularly in high-risk patients. Risk factors for ARF include advanced age, pre-existing renal impairment, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Patients with ARF may experience decreased urine output, fluid retention, and elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Treatment for ARF typically involves supportive care, such as fluid management and electrolyte supplementation, as well as addressing the underlying cause of the ren
