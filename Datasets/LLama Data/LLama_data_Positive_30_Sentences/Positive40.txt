Complication:

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure due to decreased renal perfusion and sepsis. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient required prolonged mechanical ventilation and developed multi-organ failure. He remained in the ICU for two weeks and required aggressive fluid and electrolyte management. The patient eventually recovered and was discharged home with a follow-up appointment in the nephrology clinic.
