Complication: Acute renal failure

After the surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was diagnosed based on elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The patient was volume-depleted and had evidence of acute kidney injury on ultrasound. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and had a temporarily decreased urine output. The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit, and his renal function gradually improved over the next few days. The patient was discharged from the hospital with a follow-up appointment with his nephrologist.
