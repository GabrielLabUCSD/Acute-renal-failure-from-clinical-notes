Complication:

After the surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure, which was caused by a combination of factors, including hypotension, sepsis, and medication-induced nephrotoxicity. The patient's creatinine levels increased significantly, and he required dialysis. He remained in the intensive care unit for several days and received aggressive fluid and electrolyte management. The patient's kidney function eventually improved, and he was able to discontinue dialysis. However, he required close monitoring and follow-up to ensure complete recovery of his kidney function.
