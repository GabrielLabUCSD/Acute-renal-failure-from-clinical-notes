29. The patient has a history of weakness in the knees.
30. The patient is scheduled for a lumbar fusion surgery to address the chronic back pain.

Acute Renal Failure Complication:

The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) postoperatively, which was likely related to the combination of hypovolemia from the surgery and the patient's pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.8 mg/dL preoperatively to 4.5 mg/dL on postoperative day 1, indicating a significant decline in renal function. The patient experienced decreased urine output, nausea, and vomiting, which further contributed to the development of ARF. The patient required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to support their renal function during the critical period. The patient's renal function improved gradually over the next few days, and the patient was eventually able to recover fully from the ARF complication.
