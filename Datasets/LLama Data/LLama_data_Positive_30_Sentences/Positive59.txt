Complication: Acute Renal Failure

The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) postoperatively after his total knee replacement surgery. He had been experiencing worsening shortness of breath for the past month, which was found to be due to ARF. He is currently undergoing dialysis and his kidney function is being closely monitored. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and stage 4 kidney disease puts him at higher risk for developing ARF. The patient's hypertension and diabetes also contribute to his risk of developing ARF. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use disorder may also have contributed to his risk of developing ARF. The patient is being closely monitored and managed by a nephrologist and his care team to ensure the best possible outcome.
