Complication: Acute renal failure

After the surgery, the patient developed pain and swelling in the right kidney area. He complained of oliguria and nausea, and his blood tests showed elevated creatinine and urea levels. The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure and was started on intravenous fluids and medications to help improve renal function. He was closely monitored in the intensive care unit and his renal function gradually improved over the next few days. The patient required temporary dialysis and was later discharged home with regular follow-up appointments with his nephrologist.
