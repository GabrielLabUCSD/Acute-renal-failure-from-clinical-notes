Complication: Acute renal failure

After surgery, the patient experienced acute renal failure, which was likely related to the combination of chronic kidney disease, perioperative hypotension, and the use of certain medications that can harm the kidneys, such as NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors. The patient required dialysis and remained in the intensive care unit for close monitoring. The patient's renal function gradually improved over time, and he was able to be weaned off dialysis and discharged home after a prolonged hospital stay.
