Complication:

The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) post-surgery, which was diagnosed on the second day of his hospital stay. The patient had been complaining of decreased urine output and increasing fatigue. Lab results showed an increase in serum creatinine level to 4.5 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.8 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed pyuria and hematuria. The patient was started on intravenous furosemide and hydration therapy, and his urine output increased gradually over the next few days. The patient was monitored closely for any signs of fluid overload, and his medications were adjusted accordingly. The patient's renal function improved, and his serum creatinine level decreased to 2.5 mg/dL by the time of discharge. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician and nephrologist for further management of his chronic kidney disease and to monitor for any further episodes of ARF.
