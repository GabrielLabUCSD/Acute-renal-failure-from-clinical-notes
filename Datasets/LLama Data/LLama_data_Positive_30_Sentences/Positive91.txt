21. Follow-up Care: The patient will follow up with the orthopedic surgeon in 2 weeks and then again at 6 weeks for a wound check and to assess his progress.
22. Complications: The patient is at risk for postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and acute renal failure.
23. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of hypertension and diabetes increase his risk for acute renal failure after surgery.
