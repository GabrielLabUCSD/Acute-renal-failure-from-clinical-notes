The patient's current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and aspirin. He takes no herbal supplements or over-the-counter medications.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95% on room air

The patient's laboratory results reveal:

* White blood cell count: 12,000 cells/mm3
* Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 42%
* Platelets: 200,000 cells/mm3
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 180 mg/dL
* Cholesterol: 200 mg/dL
* Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL
* Alanine transaminase (ALT): 50 IU/L
* Aspartate transaminase (AST): 70 IU/L

The patient's urinalysis reveals trace amounts of protein and blood.

The patient is scheduled for a surgical procedure and is at risk for developing acute renal failure (ARF) due to his age, comorbidities, and the surgical procedure itself.

Post-operatively, the patient develops oliguria, increasing serum creatinine, and metabolic acidosis, consistent with acute renal failure. He is managed with fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and dialysis.

The patient's vital signs during this time are:

* Blood pressure: 180/100 mmHg
* Heart rate: 120 beats per minute
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92% on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen

* Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 38%
* Platelets: 150,000 cells/mm3
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 45 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 250 mg/dL
* Cholesterol: 250 mg/dL
* Triglycerides: 200 mg/dL
* Alanine transaminase (ALT): 100 IU/L
