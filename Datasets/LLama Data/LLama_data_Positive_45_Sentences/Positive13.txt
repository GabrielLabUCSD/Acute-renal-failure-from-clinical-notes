Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He has been smoking for the past 40 years and has a history of alcohol abuse. He has been experiencing worsening left knee pain for the past year, which has been diagnosed as osteoarthritis. The patient has tried physical therapy and medication but has not found relief. He is now planning to undergo a total knee replacement surgery.

The patient has a history of previous surgeries, including a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He has also been diagnosed with sleep apnea and has been using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine for the past year.

The patient"s blood work reveals an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, which may indicate a slight elevation in the risk of perioperative complications. His liver function tests are within normal limits, but his creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.5 mg/dL. The patient"s urine output has been decreased over the past 24 hours.

The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting for the past day, which may be related to his recent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management. He has also been taking aspirin and metformin for his cardiovascular and diabetic conditions.

The patient"s surgical risk for the total knee replacement surgery is moderate due to his age, medical history, and laboratory results. The anesthesiologist has recommended Regional anesthesia with sedation for the procedure.

Postoperative Care:

The patient underwent a successful total knee replacement surgery under regional anesthesia with sedation. He was closely monitored in the recovery room for the first 24 hours and was transferred to the orthopedic ward for further care.

On postoperative day 2, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) with a serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL and an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. The patient"s urine output decreased further, and he has been experiencing decreased urine output, fluid retention, and generalized edema.

The patient has been diagnosed with postoperative acute renal failure (ARF), which is a common complication after surgery, especially in patients with preoperative renal impairment. The patient is currently being treated with intravenous fluids and medication to manage his fluid and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient"s respiratory status has been closely monitored, and he has been weaned off anesthesia and extubated. He is currently breathing spontaneously and has minimal respiratory distress.

The patient"s blood glucose levels have been monitored closely, and he has been receiving insulin to manage his blood sugar levels. His white blood cell count and platelet count have also been monitored closely to rule out any postoperative infection.

The patient is currently stable but is being closely monitored for any further complications. He is receiving adequate pain management and is able to move his knee freely without much discomfort.

Discharge and Follow-up:

The patient will be discharged from the hospital in stable condition. He will be advised to continue his medication and follow up with his orthopedic surgeon and primary care physician for further management of his knee replacement and acute renal failure.

He will also be advised to fluid and electrolyte imbalance and to monitore his blood sugar levels closely. The patient will be referred to a nephrologist for further management of his renal failure and to rule out any underlying kidney disease.

The patient will also be referred to physical therapy to ensure proper knee mobility and strength after discharge. The patient is expected to make a full recovery from his knee replacement surgery, but close monitoring and follow-up will be necessary to manage his postoperative complications.
