I'm happy to help you with that! Here's a patient summary with 45 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery, as well as a possible complication of acute renal failure after surgery:

Current Medications:

* Lisinopril (Zestril) for hypertension
* Metformin (Glucophage) for diabetes mellitus
* Atorvastatin (Lipitor) for hyperlipidemia
* Oxygen therapy for COPD
* Alprazolam (Xanax) as needed for anxiety

* Mother died of breast cancer at age 70
* One sibling with a history of hypertension

Reason for Surgery:

* Elective total knee replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis

Preoperative Examination:

* Blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92% on room air
* Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
* Weight: 250 lbs (113 kg)
* BMI: 35
* ASA physical status: 3

Lab Results:

* Complete blood count (CBC): Within normal limits
* Electrolyte panel: Within normal limits
* Renal function panel: Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 50 mL/min/1.73m²
* Lipid profile: Total cholesterol 180 mg/dL, LDL 100 mg/dL, HDL 40 mg/dL, triglycerides 150 mg/dL
* Urinalysis: Proteinuria 1+, blood 1+

Imaging Studies:

* Chest X-ray: Within normal limits
* Electrocardiogram (ECG): Within normal limits
* Ultrasound of the knee: Severe osteoarthritis

Plan:

* Elective total knee replacement surgery
* Preoperative optimization of medical conditions
* Close monitoring of renal function during surgery and postoperative period

Complications:

* Acute renal failure (ARF) developed after surgery, likely due to a combination of factors such as hypotension, anesthesia, and pre-existing CKD.
* ARF was treated with fluid resuscitation, medication adjustments, and close monitoring.
* Patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.
