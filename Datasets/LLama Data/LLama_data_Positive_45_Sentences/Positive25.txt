I understand that you need help creating a patient summary with 45 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery, including a complication of acute renal failure after surgery. Here's a possible summary:

Patient Name: John Doe
Age: 65
Gender: Male

Medical History:

* Hypertension
* Diabetes
* Hyperlipidemia
* History of smoking
* Obesity (BMI 35)
* Sleep apnea
* History of coronary artery disease
* Previous myocardial infarction
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* History of asthma
* Gerd
* Hiatal hernia
* History of peptic ulcer disease
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3
* Proteinuria (24-hour urine protein > 500mg)
* Hematuria (rust-colored urine)
* Elevated serum creatinine (1.8mg/dL)
* Elevated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR 60ml/min/1.73m2)

Surgical History:

* Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) 10 years ago
* Hip replacement surgery 5 years ago
* colonoscopy 2 years ago
* Kidney biopsy 1 year ago

Current Symptoms:

* Abdominal pain (7/10)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Fatigue (7/10)
* Weakness (7/10)
* Decreased urine output

Medications:

* Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) 40mg daily
* Metformin (diabetes medication) 1000mg daily
* Atorvastatin (lipid-lowering medication) 40mg daily
* Omeprazole (GERD medication) 20mg daily
* Aspirin (anti-platelet medication) 81mg daily
* Alprazolam (anxiolytic medication) 0.5mg daily

Lab Results:

* Serum creatinine 2.0mg/dL (elevated)
* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR 50ml/min/1.73m2) (elevated)
* Proteinuria (24-hour urine protein > 1000mg) (elevated)
* Hematuria (rust-colored urine) (elevated)
* Electrolytes (serum potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium) within normal limits
* Complete blood count within normal limits
* Lipid profile within normal limits

Complications:

* Acute renal failure (creatinine 2.0mg/dL, eGFR 50ml/min/1.73m2)
* Severe proteinuria (24-hour urine protein > 1000mg)
* Hematuria (rust-colored urine)
* Hypertension (elevated blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Tachypnea (rapid breathing rate)

Plan:

* Admission to the hospital for observation and management of acute renal failure
* Hold all medications that may be harmful to the kidneys, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diuretics
* Administer intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and support renal function
* Monitor urine output and electrolytes closely
* Consider dialysis if renal function does not improve
* Consult nephrology for further management
