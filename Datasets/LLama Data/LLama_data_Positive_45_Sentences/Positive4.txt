Complication:

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was diagnosed based on a sudden increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in urine output. The patient was started on hemodialysis and was monitored closely for signs of fluid overload. The patient's renal function gradually improved over time, and he was eventually able to discontinue hemodialysis. However, he continued to have chronic kidney disease and required ongoing monitoring and management of his renal function.
