Recent Lab Results:

* Creatinine level: 1.8 mg/dL
* BUN level: 40 mg/dL
* eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate): 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
* HbA1c: 8.5%

Complications:

* Acute renal failure (ARF) developed post-operatively after CABG surgery
* Elevated troponin level (0.08 ng/mL) suggesting myocardial damage
* ECG showing ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and aVL
* Borderline hypocalcemia (serum calcium level: 8.6 mg/dL)
* Urine output: 400 mL in the last 24 hours
* Respiratory: occasional wheezing and bilateral crackles on lung auscultation
* Cardiovascular: borderline tachycardia (heart rate: 102 bpm) and mild hypotension (blood pressure: 100/60 mmHg)

The patient is scheduled for a elective surgery and the anesthesiologist should be aware of the patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CKD, COPD, GERD, glaucoma, and recent MI, as well as the patient's current medications and allergies. The patient's recent lab results show evidence of acute renal failure and mild hypocalcemia. The patient's social history and family history should also be taken into account when determining the patient's surgical and anesthesia plan. The patient's limited mobility and history of knee pain should also be considered when planning the patient's post-operative care.
