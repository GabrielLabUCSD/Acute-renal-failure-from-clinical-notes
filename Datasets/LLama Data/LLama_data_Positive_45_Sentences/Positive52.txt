Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral knee pain. He has been experiencing gradually worsening back pain over the past 5 years, with occasional radiating pain down his legs. The patient has tried physical therapy and multiple medications, but has not found sufficient relief. He has also been experiencing increasing difficulty with ambulation and standing for long periods. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. He had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and has been compliant with his medication regimen since then. He denies any recent chest pain or shortness of breath. He has been a smoker for 40 years, but quit 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally and has a history of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His family history is significant for heart disease and stroke. The patient is allergic to penicillin and has a history of adverse reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He is taking aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and oxycodone.

Surgical History:

The patient is scheduled to undergo a bilateral total knee replacement surgery. He has no history of previous surgeries.

Acute Renal Failure Complication:

Postoperatively, the patient developed acute renal failure, which was diagnosed based on elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and decreased urine output. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and invasive blood pressure monitoring. He was also given aLoop diuretic medication to help increase urine production. The renal failure was likely caused by a combination of factors, including pre-existing chronic kidney disease, hypovolemia, and anesthesia. The patient's renal function began to improve within 24 hours of initiating treatment and he was able to recover fully within 3 days.

Other relevant information:

The patient has a history of sleep apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure machine at home. He also has a history of mild degenerative joint disease in his hips and ankles. The patient is retired and lives with his wife, who is able to assist with his care. He has a support system in place, including a daughter who lives nearby and is able to help with transportation and errands. The patient is anxious about the upcoming surgery and has expressed concerns about the potential for infection, pain management, and duration of recovery. He is interested in exploring alternative pain management options, such as physical therapy and non-opioid medications, after the surgery.

The patient's surgical and medical history, as well as his acute renal failure complication, will be important to consider when planning his anesthesia and postoperative care. It is essential to closely monitor his renal function and fluid status during and after surgery, as well as to manage his pain effectively while minimizing the risk of complications. The patient's anxiety and concerns should also be addressed to ensure a positive surgical experience.
