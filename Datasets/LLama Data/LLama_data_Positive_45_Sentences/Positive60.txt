Patient Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has been a smoker for the past 30 years and has a history of alcohol use disorder. He presents today for a preoperative evaluation before undergoing a total knee arthroplasty. The patient has been experiencing worsening left knee pain and limited mobility for the past year, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

The patient has had a previous surgical history, including a cholecystectomy and a hernia repair. He has also had a history of cardiovascular disease, including a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and a coronary artery bypass grafting 5 years ago. He has been compliant with his medications and has been following a healthy diet and exercise regimen.

The patient's current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. He has no known allergies to medications. He has been advised to stop taking aspirin 7 days before the surgery and to stop taking other medications as directed by his surgeon.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. His lab results show a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mg/dL. His urinalysis shows trace protein and blood.

The patient's ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 75 beats per minute. His echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. His chest X-ray shows a clear lung field and a normal cardiothoracic ratio.

The patient's surgical plan includes a total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia. The surgeon has recommended a postoperative regimen of pain management, which includes patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and physical therapy. The patient has been advised to follow a rehabilitation program to ensure a full and speedy recovery.

Postoperative Complications:

The patient developed acute renal failure on the second postoperative day, which was diagnosed based on a sudden increase in serum creatinine level and a decrease in urine output. The patient's urine output was 100 mL in the first 24 hours after surgery, and it decreased to 30 mL in the second 24 hours. The patient's serum creatinine level increased from 1.5 mg/dL preoperatively to 2.5 mg/dL on the second postoperative day.

The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids and vasopressors to support his blood pressure. His urine output and serum creatinine level were closely monitored, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for close observation. The patient was also started on hemodialysis to support his renal function.

The patient's acute renal failure was managed successfully, and his renal function improved over the next few days. His serum creatinine level decreased to 1.8 mg/dL, and his urine output increased to 150 mL in 24 hours. The patient was weaned off hemodialysis and was discharged from the hospital on the seventh postoperative day.

The patient was advised to follow a strict fluid management regimen and to monitor his renal function closely. He was also advised to avoid any medications that may exacerbate his renal impairment. The patient was referred to a nephrologist for further management of his chronic kidney disease.

Conclusion:

The patient underwent a successful total knee arthroplasty, but developed acute renal failure as a postoperative complication. The patient's renal function improved with supportive care and hemodialysis, and he was discharged from the hospital on the seventh postoperative day. The patient was advised to follow a strict fluid management regimen and to monitor his renal function closely. He was also referred to a neph
