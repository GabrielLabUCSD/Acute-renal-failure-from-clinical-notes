Complication: Acute Renal Failure

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as dehydration, blood loss, and medication side effects. The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels increased significantly, indicating impaired renal function. The patient required dialysis and fluid management to restore renal function and prevent further complications. The patient's renal failure was managed with supportive care and close monitoring, and the patient eventually recovered fully. However, the complication prolonged the patient's hospital stay and added to the overall cost of care.

This patient summary provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's medical history and surgical risks, as well as a complication that may arise
