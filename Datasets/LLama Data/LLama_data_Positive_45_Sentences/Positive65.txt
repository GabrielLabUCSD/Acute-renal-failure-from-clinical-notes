I understand that you need a patient summary with 45 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery, as well as a description of the patient experiencing acute renal failure complication after surgery.

Here's a sample patient summary:

Surgical History:

* Appendectomy at age 25
* Cholecystectomy at age 40
* Hip replacement at age 50

Current Medications:

* Lisinopril for hypertension
* Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia
* Metformin for diabetes mellitus
* Cephalexin for skin infection

Allergies:

* Penicillin
* Sulfa drugs

Family History:

* Father died of myocardial infarction at age 60
* Mother has hypertension and hyperlipidemia
* One sibling with diabetes mellitus

Social History:

* Married with two adult children
* Works as an accountant
* Does not exercise regularly
* Reports stress related to work

Reason for Surgery:

* Elective surgery for hernia repair

Preoperative Examination:

* Blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg
* Heart rate: 80 bpm
* Respiratory rate: 16 bpm
* Temperature: 98.6Â°F
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Laboratory tests:
	+ White blood cell count: 12,000 cells/mm3
	+ Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 200,000 cells/mm3
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 20 mg/dL
	+ Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Physical examination:
	+ Abdominal examination reveals a reducible hernia
	+ No signs of infection or fluid accumulation

Intraoperative Course:

* Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation
* Surgical technique: Open hernia repair with mesh
* Estimated blood loss: 200 mL
* Fluid management: Crystalloid and colloid resuscitation

Postoperative Course:

* Patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition
* Postoperative analgesia: Fentanyl and acetaminophen
* Patient was encouraged to ambulate and perform deep breathing exercises
* Monitored for signs of respiratory and cardiac complications

Complications:

* Acute renal failure (ARF) developed on postoperative day 2
* Creatinine level increased to 3.5 mg/dL
* BUN level increased to 45 mg/dL
* Urine output decreased to 100 mL in 8 hours
* Patient was started on hemodialysis

Management of ARF:

* Hemodialysis was initiated on postoperative day 3
* Dialysis frequency: 3 times a week
* Dialysate: 2 liters of 2% sorbitol
* Duration of dialysis: 4 hours per session
* Patient's fluid and electrolyte balance were closely monitored

Current Status:

* Patient is currently on hemodialysis for ARF
* Creatinine level: 2.5 mg/dL
* BUN level: 20 mg/dL
* Urine output: 500 mL in 8 hours
* Patient is being closely monitored for signs of fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance

Next Steps:

* Continue hemodialysis until renal function
