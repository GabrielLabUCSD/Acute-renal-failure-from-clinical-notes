* Intraoperative neuromonitoring

Surgical Complications:

* Acute renal failure (ARF) developed postoperatively
* Oliguria and elevated serum creatinine
* Requires hemodialysis
* No evidence of obstructive uropathy
* No evidence of sepsis or pyelonephritis

Postoperative Course:

* ARF resolved with hemodialysis and fluid management
* Pain managed with opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
* Ambulated with assistance on postoperative day 1
* Gradually improved and discharged home on postoperative day 4

Follow-up Plan:

* Follow-up appointment with surgeon in 2 weeks
* Follow-up appointment with nephrologist in 4 weeks
* Monitoring of renal function and electrolytes

The patient's medical history and current presentation suggest a low risk for perioperative complications. However, the patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity may increase the risk of perioperative cardiovascular events and respiratory complications. The patient's history of smoking and previous alcohol consumption may increase the risk of postoperative respiratory depression and other respiratory complications. The patient's history of occasional alcohol consumption may also increase the risk of postoperative delirium. The patient's laboratory results show mild renal impairment, which may increase the risk of acute renal failure (ARF) perioperatively. The patient's imaging studies show diffuse disc bulging and spinal stenosis, which may increase the risk of postoperative neurological complications. The patient's procedure plan includes lumbar decompression and fusion, which carries a risk of postoperative neurological and vascular complications. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4.
