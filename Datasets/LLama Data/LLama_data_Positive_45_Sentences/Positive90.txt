Sure, here's a patient summary with 45 sentences describing a patient's medical history who is planning to have any type of surgery, as well as the possibility of acute renal failure complication after surgery:

Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of chronic back pain and bilateral knee pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has been smoking for the past 40 years and has a history of alcohol use disorder. The patient's mother died of breast cancer at the age of 55.

The patient's surgical history includes a cholecystectomy at the age of 45 and a hernia repair at the age of 55. The patient has a history of allergic reactions to penicillin and sulfa drugs. The patient is currently taking aspirin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and an elevated serum creatinine level. The patient's urinalysis shows pyuria and hematuria.

The patient is scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and a left knee arthroscopy. The patient is at high risk for postoperative complications due to his history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use also increases his risk for postoperative complications.

Postoperative Care:

The patient will require close monitoring of his vital signs, particularly his blood pressure and tissue perfusion. The patient will also require close monitoring of his renal function, including frequent measurement of his serum creatinine level and urine output.

The patient will be at high risk for postoperative infections, particularly urinary tract infections, due to his history of pyuria and hematuria. The patient will require prompt treatment of any signs of infection, including fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea.

The patient will also be at high risk for postoperative respiratory complications, particularly respiratory failure, due to his history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient will require close monitoring of his respiratory status, including frequent assessment of his oxygen saturation levels and respiratory rate.

The patient will require aggressive pain management, particularly in the immediate postoperative period. The patient's pain will be managed with a combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics.

The patient will require close monitoring of his surgical site, particularly for signs of wound infection or hernia. The patient will also require close monitoring of his urinary catheter, particularly for signs of urinary tract infection or retention.

The patient will require early mobilization and rehabilitation to prevent postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The patient will require close monitoring of his nutritional status, particularly his protein and calorie intake. The patient may require supplemental nutrition to ensure adequate wound healing.

The patient will require close monitoring of his blood glucose levels, particularly in the immediate postoperative period. The patient may require adjustments to his diabetic medications to ensure adequate glycemic control.

The patient will require close monitoring of his fluid status, particularly in the immediate postoperative period. The patient may require fluid restriction to prevent fluid overload.

Acute Renal Failure:

The patient developed acute renal failure on postoperative day 2, which was detected by an increase in his serum creatinine level and a decrease in his urine output. The patient's urinalysis showed pyuria and hematuria.

The patient was fluid-overloaded, and his fluid status was closely monitored. The patient's fluid intake was restricted, and diuretics were added to his medication regimen.

The patient's renal function continued to decline, and he required hemodialysis on postoperative day 5. The patient's hemodialysis session was successful in removing waste products from his blood and improving his ren
