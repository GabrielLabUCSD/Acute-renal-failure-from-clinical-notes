Complication: Acute Renal Failure

After the surgical procedure, the patient experienced acute renal failure, which was caused by a combination of factors, including sepsis, shock, and decreased renal perfusion. The patient's urine output decreased significantly, and he developed elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The patient required dialysis and intensive care unit (ICU) admission for close monitoring and management. The patient's renal function did recover gradually over time, but it took several weeks for him to fully recover.
