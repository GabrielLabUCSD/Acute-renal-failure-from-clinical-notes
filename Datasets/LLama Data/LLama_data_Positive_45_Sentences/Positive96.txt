Patient Summary:

This patient, a 65-year-old male, has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 3. He has been smoking for 40 years and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He recently had a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. He has also been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has a history of pneumonia. He takes medications for his conditions, including aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and omeprazole.

The patient has been admitted to the hospital for elective surgery to repair a hernia. Preoperative lab results show a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 50 mg/dL. The patient's eGFR is 45 ml/min.

After surgery, the patient developed acute renal failure (ARF) and required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). He also had a fever and leukocytosis, concerning for sepsis. 

Given the patient's medical history and current condition, the anesthesiologist should closely monitor his hemodynamics, fluids, and electrolytes during surgery. They should also consider the potential risks and benefits of continuing Aspirin and Atorvastatin, as they may increase the risk of bleeding.

The patient's history of COPD and recent pneumonia increases the risk of postoperative respiratory complications. They should receive appropriate respiratory support and close monitoring in the postoperative period. 

In addition, the patient's risk of sepsis and ARF should be closely monitored. Appropriate antibiotics should be initiated promptly if there are signs of infection or sepsis. The patient's fluid management should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload, which could further impair renal function.

The patient should be closely monitored for signs of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, given their history of MI and PCI.

Before surgery, the patient should be well hydrated with intravenous fluids. The anesthesiologist should also consider the use of a thoracic epidural to help control postoperative pain and reduce the risk of respiratory complications.

Given the patient's history of CKD, close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and fluid balance is crucial during and after surgery. The patient's medications should be carefully reviewed, and those that may be harmful in the perioperative setting, such as ACE inhibitors or potassium-sparing agents, should be held.

The patient's surgical risk is increased due to their age, CKD, COPD, and recent MI and pneumonia. The anesthesiologist should carefully consider these risks when planning the anesthetic and perioperative care.
